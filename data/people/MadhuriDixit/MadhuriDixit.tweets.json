Talking about #EkDoTeen made me so nostalgic. We'll do it again very soon. Until next time, stay home &amp; stay safe! I wouldn't say nervous. But it was surely a great experience for me https://t.co/7D7LE6lxyl Hard work, passion &amp; dedication https://t.co/UWFFs9O7sR I didn't know that the song would get so popular. But it definitely feels great that it did! https://t.co/jCW1NnwLzS The hookstep became so popular at that time. I was shocked to know that people used to demand the song to be replayed in the theatres before the movie could continue &amp; fling money on the screens. Everyone had started calling me Mohini. Wow, this song brought back many memories! Let's start our #SunoSunaoWithMD Listening Party with #EkDoTeen! Right from starting the rehearsals 10-15 days before the shoot to shooting with a real crowd of 1,000 people, the song has been so special. \nSend me your questions &amp; share your memories of the song with me. Hi guys, let's have a #SunoSunaoWithMD listening party today at 4 pm. We can listen to one of my songs and I can share my special memories as well.
