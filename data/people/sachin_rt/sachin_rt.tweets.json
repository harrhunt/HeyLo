Starc\u2019s wrist position and shape on the ball is something that was missing for a while.\nThe way he is now able to get the ball back in makes him a far more dangerous bowler.\n\n#AUSvIND @Iam_neel Losing someone you love is one of the hardest times of your life. I am sure he will always be with you in good times and more so in bad, and shall always be looking after you from above.\n\nBirthday wishes Neel. We are all wishing well for you.

It\u2019s always tough when the ball is going behind, over your head.\n\n#MIvRR #IPL2020 .@surya_14kumar is special and very dangerous because he can play on all sides of the wicket.\n\n#MIvRR #IPL2020 .@surya_14kumar has played the best shot of the match so far.\n\n#MIvRR #IPL2020 .@DelhiCapitals really bowled well.\nSmart bowling changes by @ShreyasIyer15 which didn\u2019t allow the batsmen to get off to flying starts.\n@RCBTweets has a good batting line-up but were completely outplayed today.\n\n#DCvRCB #IPL2020 The ball may grip a little bit because the roller is used during the break but as the ball gets wet due to dew it will start skidding. \n\n#RCBvDC #IPL2020 Crucial knock by Stoinis to propel @DelhiCapitals to a good total but the wicket looks good to bat on.\nGiven the batting strength of @RCBTweets, it won\u2019t be easy for Delhi to defend.\n\n#RCBvDC #IPL2020 That\u2019s an unbelievable shot by @RishabhPant17!\ud83e\udd2f\n\n#RCBvDC #IPL2020 Just shows how important @Sundarwashi5\u2019s first spell is. He has given away just 20 runs in his 4 overs while bowling in the powerplay when the other 4 have gone for 55.\n\n#RCBvDC #IPL2020 This is a big challenge thrown by Virat to both Prithvi  and Shikhar by bringing on Chahal. He is looking for a wicket here. \n\n#RCBvDC #IPL2020 What an incredible shot by @PrithviShaw there!\n\nA million dollar reaction by @imVkohli after almost applying saliva on the ball. \n\nSometimes instincts takeover!\ud83d\ude0b\n\nRCBvDC #IPL2020 Wishing you a wonderful year @Sundarwashi5!\n\nHave enjoyed the way you have bowled in this IPL. Keep working hard. Happy birthday Rishabh.\nWishing you a wonderful year &amp; IPL season ahead. https://t.co/U6cHpfRWGx Comprehensive win by @ChennaiIPL. @klrahul11 and @nicholas_47 played well to put a decent total on the board but the way @ShaneRWatson33 &amp; @faf1307 batted, they\u2019ve made this chase look rather easy. Well done #CSK.\n\n#KXIPvCSK #IPL2020 2\ufe0f\u20e3 very important and sensational catches taken by @rdchahar1 &amp; @ishankishan51 have put #MI in a strong position.\n\n#IPL2020 #MIvSRH That\u2019s a big wicket for #MI. @im_manishpandey was batting really well and looked calm and composed to take the game to the wire. Don\u2019t think Pollard would miss a catch like that even in his sleep.\ud83d\ude0b\n\n#MIvSRH #IPL2020 .@rdchahar1\u2019s overs are going to be the key ones for #MI as well as #SRH.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s the reason @KieronPollard55 has come into the attack to cover up overs for someone who\u2019s having a bad day.\n\n#IPL2020 #MIvSRH @m_sam0708 @mipaltan Well done \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb What a catch by @im_manishpandey !\nTremendous athleticism...\n\n#MIvSRH #IPL2020 How much do you think @mipaltan will score at the end of 20 overs?\n\n#IPL2020 #MIvSRH With 2 left-handers at the crease @rashidkhan_19\u2019s role becomes very crucial.\n\n#IPL2020 #MIvSRH https://t.co/6JvYTWfGzx Good knocks by @NitishRana_27, @Eoin16 &amp; Rahul Tripathi to back themselves and make this huge chase so interesting. @AnrichNortje02 bowled well upfront &amp; @HarshalPatel23 was a good surprise package.\n\n#DCvKKR #IPL2020 .@ShreyasIyer15 Tremendous striking!\n\nEnjoyed watching.\n\n#DCvKKR #IPL2020 Amazing shots played by @ShreyasIyer15 and @PrithviShaw!\n\nThe way @DelhiCapitals are batting, there is a possibility of them getting to about 215-220.\n\n#DCvKKR #IPL2020 A comfortable win for @RCBTweets. @devdpd07 has been impressive once again. Good to see @imVkohli back amongst the runs and it only makes RCB stronger.\n\n#RCBvRR #IPL2020 Good recovery by #SRH. \nGood contribution by Garg and Abhishek to get them to a decent total. Mind you Chennai\u2019s batting depth is much better now.\nSRH fast bowlers should get some swing and off the pitch movement upfront.\n\n#CSKvSRH #IPL2020 It's true that we can't do everything, but we can do something.\nTo me, Gandhiji is a symbol of the power of an individual to inspire change for a better world. Remembering him on his 151st birth anniversary. #GandhiJayanti https://t.co/Uv9RWzuYHV The 4th over by @krunalpandya24 and the 5th by @Jaspritbumrah93 changed the momentum of the game. @rdchahar1\u2019s 2 wickets were very important in the middle overs. #KXIP\u00a0 never regained momentum after that to put #MI\u00a0 bowlers under any pressure.\n\n#KXIPvMI #IPL2020 Comprehensive win by @mipaltan!\nThe opening partnership for @lionsdenkxip looked threatening but a great bowling performance by MI who got wickets at regular intervals.\n@nicholas_47 looked in sublime touch and I liked the bowling changes made by @ImRo45.\n.\n.\n. https://t.co/WruhyXLyz8 Good overs by @krunalpandya24 and @Jaspritbumrah93. The ball is gripping a bit while @rdchahar1 is bowling but it may stop in some time when the dew makes the seam wet. The ball will start skidding on to the bat.\n\n#KXIPvMI #IPL2020 191 is a very competitive total on this ground. Brilliantly paced innings by @ImRo45. An off spinner to bowl against @hardikpandya7 and @KieronPollard55 in the 20th over! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n#KXIPvMI #IPL2020 Wishing our Hon. President, Ram Nath Kovind ji a very happy birthday. Hope you have a wonderful year ahead. @rashtrapatibhvn @LaureusSport @YUVSTRONG12 From starting as teammates to becoming friends for life. \ud83d\ude03\nIt's been a wonderful journey with Yuvi, who's a champion both on and off the field! &amp; a fantastic catch by the athletic Nagarkoti.\n\n@TC59\u2019s 54 towards the end got @rajasthanroyals to a respectable total.\n\n#RRvKKR #IPL2020 Important knock by @RealShubmanGill who played some good shots. @Russell12A\u2019s brief cameo &amp; good finish by @Eoin16 got @KKRiders to a decent score.\n\nTerrific bowling performance as well. Bowling changes were spot on &amp; the team balance looked good, https://t.co/4gMvkRqjWy Thanks for sharing this! \ud83d\ude42 https://t.co/2r4e7cEdCm Brilliant catch by \n@IamSanjuSamson!\n\nI know how much it hurts when you bang your head like this on the ground. I experienced it in the 1992 World Cup in our match against the WI when I took a catch. \n#IPL2020 #RRvKKR Wishing you a very happy birthday Deepa. Keep inspiring everyone. https://t.co/ynngYW7Gz8 Well played to both teams.\n\nUnbelievable Cricket! \n\n#RCBvMI #IPL2020 Ha Ha Ha... this is an unbelievable match.\nAur kya kahein! \n\n#IPL2020 #RCBvMI SPEECHLESS! \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\n\n@ishankishan51 @KieronPollard55 \n\n#RCBvMI #IPL2020 This is a make or break over! A fantastic spell by @Sundarwashi5. His ability to keep watching the batsman\u2019s feet till the last moment and adjust his line and length is a special ability.\n\n#RCBvMI #IPL2020 Big responsibility on @hardikpandya7 and @ishankishan51 to build a partnership and not let the required run rate go up too much. #RCBvMI #IPL2020 Good start by the @RCBTweets  openers @devdpd07 &amp; @AaronFinch5 and a strong finish by Shivam Dube.\nSimply spectacular hitting by @ABdeVilliers17.\nCompetitive total put up.\n\n#RCBvMI #IPL2020 \u0935\u093e\u0922\u0926\u093f\u0935\u0938\u093e\u091a\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0915 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0947\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e, \u0932\u0924\u093e \u0926\u0940\u0926\u0940! \u0924\u0941\u092e\u091a\u094d\u092f\u093e \u091a\u0947\u0939\u0931\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0935\u0930\u091a\u0947 \u0939\u0938\u0942 \u0938\u0924\u0924 \u0915\u093e\u092f\u092e \u0930\u093e\u0939\u093e\u0935\u0947 \u0906\u0923\u093f \u0924\u0941\u092e\u091a\u093e \u0917\u094b\u0921 \u0906\u0935\u093e\u091c \u0928\u0947\u0939\u092e\u0940 \u0906\u092e\u091a\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0915\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0935\u0930 \u092a\u0921\u0924 \u0930\u093e\u0939\u0942 \u0926\u0947. https://t.co/Bg0JwkvFtO Well done @rajasthanroyals &amp;  @rahultewatia02.\n\nWho would have imagined #RR chasing 223 with 3 balls to spare? Harsha, may be the ground got smaller in the second innings. \ud83d\ude09 https://t.co/1F4XJ71RpW Jonty, I was talking about saves on the boundary line.\n\nIn your territory (30 yard circle), you were undoubtedly the best! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb https://t.co/tZSq3VL1Y5 Terrific batting by @rajasthanroyals\u2019 batsmen Smith, Sanju &amp; Tewatia to chase this mega total.\n\nThey kept their cool and accelerated beautifully.\n\nSurprised how the @lionsdenkxip fast bowlers didn\u2019t bowl many yorkers and also failed to use M Ashwin enough. #RRvKXIP #IPL2020 https://t.co/f52wF11uig This is the best save I have seen in my life. Simply incredible!! \ud83d\udc4d\n\n#IPL2020 #RRvKXIP https://t.co/2r7cNZmUaw Both KL and Mayank have looked in total control and have made UAE their home ground(s)!\n\n#IPL2020 #RRvKXIP https://t.co/voPS4oYmJC Making a trip to Dreamland this #WorldTourismDay! \ud83d\ude0b https://t.co/i1wYWYXcni Always loved listening to S. P. Balasubrahmanyam ji\u2019s music. Deeply saddened by his demise. His song \u2018Sach Mere Yaar Hai\u2019 from Saagar is one my favorites which I have always had on my playlist.\nMay his soul rest in peace.\n\nMy prayer and thoughts with his family &amp; friends. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc https://t.co/N4unwWlhHI Wishing you a very happy birthday and a healthy year ahead, Bishan Paaji. Hope you have a good time on this special day of yours. https://t.co/MDt685prcr .@klrahul11 has led from the front.\nSuper innings! He has paced his innings nicely and timed the ball beautifully.\n\n#KXIvRCB #IPL2020 https://t.co/yOufAjYoAu Absolutely heartbreaking news about Dean Jones passing away.\nA wonderful soul taken away too soon. Had the opportunity to play against him during my first tour of Australia.\nMay his soul rest in peace and my condolences to his loved ones. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc https://t.co/u6oEY1h7zz Great start by @mipaltan fast bowlers and well supported by Rahul &amp; Pollard.\nAt no stage did it appear that any partnership threatened to chase the target.\n\n#KKRvMI #IPL2020 https://t.co/9yvEJnvp2H I feel fast bowlers will get more help off the surface in the 2nd innings. Apart from Mavi, who has bowled better lengths, @KKRiders have bowled too short so far. \n\nRohit &amp; Surya have displayed fantastic strokeplay and are batting with controlled aggression.\n\n#KKRvMI #IPL2020 I expect @JofraArcher to bowl a lot of leg cutters in this innings. #CSKvsRR What a finish by @JofraArcher  taking @rajasthanroyals to 216. \nVery surprised that @NgidiLungi didn\u2019t even try to bowl a single yorker in the last over. #CSKvsRR After conceding 129 runs in 11 overs &amp; only picking up 1 wicket, this has been a terrific comeback by @ChennaiIPL.\n\n#CSKvsRR Clean striking by @IamSanjuSamson. They were all proper cricketing shots and not slogs. Smartly bowled by @NgidiLungi. Short,wide and slow. #CSKvsRR Never ground your bat on a surface that isn\u2019t hard. Batsmen need to remember that there is a desert underneath! \ud83d\ude0b #CSKvsRR .@rajasthanroyals \n strategy is clear to play around \n@stevesmith49 . I see the rest of the batsmen taking more risks. #CSKvsRR Virat has brought Saini in the 11th over which is Saini\u2019s 3rd to get a wicket, else SRH will cruise through and as I post this a catch has been dropped. \n\n#SRHvsRCB My first photo shoot with Atul happened in 1990 &amp; I've had numerous shoots with him since then. \nHave enjoyed this 30 year partnership with him. Many more exciting years ahead \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb. https://t.co/lqVJPcbRoe Happy Birthday Chris, hope it rains sixes in the desert this IPL.

They both applied themselves very well &amp; have batted patiently to shift the balance in this Test.\nIt has been a great battle between bat &amp; ball in the 1st session. #ENGvWI https://t.co/lRQseKoERZ . @root66 &amp; @DomSibley in a crucial partnership for England. WI needs to find a way to get breakthroughs while the ball is fairly new. Old Trafford is a hard surface when it dries out hence the ball will become soft. A lot will depend on how the teams play the new ball. #ENGvWI In the 1st session I noticed a few balls didn\u2019t even carry to the keeper off fast bowlers indicating a lot of dampness in the pitch.\nSmart move by @Jaseholder98 to bring on a spinner on such a track where the odd ball may grip and the other may go straight. #ENGvWI Wishing you a happy and healthy birthday Dhanraj. Continue to inspire youngsters to take up and excel in hockey\ud83c\udfd1! https://t.co/nMSPbbwPxV Good all-round performances by players from both teams. \nJermaine Blackwood played a crucial knock in a tense situation to see @windiescricket through.

That's the motive of using technology in Cricket. As we know technology isn\u2019t 100% right but neither are humans.#ENGvWI https://t.co/8At80AtRs5 I feel England is planning to rely more on reverse swing in this match. The strategy to bowl short &amp; hit the deck hard will bring reverse swing into play earlier. It has already started reversing &amp; that is what we will most likely see in the 1st &amp; the 2nd innings. #ENGvWI I got to meet my idol Gavaskar Sir for the first time in 1987.\n\nAs a 13 year old, I couldn\u2019t believe my luck that I was meeting the person I looked up to &amp; wanted to emulate.

Have a healthy &amp; safe year ahead. https://t.co/u06c37ouDh While batting against @jimmy9, I noticed his remarkable ability to bowl reverse swing REVERSE!\n\nHe is one of the best exponents of this art!

See you there. #HWC2018 #HumBhiHockey #DilHockey https://t.co/6VCpkwx8oC Many congratulations, @Pvsindhu1 for winning your maiden title at the BWF World Tour Finals. Wishing you all the best for the future. #BWFWorldTourFinals2018 https://t.co/US8NXCbALY Australia have got a very special spinner in @NathLyon421. He has got terrific variations and uses the pace and bounce from the pitch to extract maximum value. #INDvAUS Well played @imVkohli. One of your finest innings. This knock will be remembered for a long time. #INDvAUS https://t.co/Gj1dSN4k4p Heartwarming to see the entire nation supporting the Men's #HockeyWorldCup2018. Congrats @Naveen_Odisha @TheHockeyIndia for the world class arrangements. To extend my support, I\u2019ll be coming to the spectacular Kalinga Stadium tomorrow.

Have a wonderful year ahead. https://t.co/O1ffhKFwre @arvindtangadi Yes, Jadeja could\u2019ve played today but Hanuma Vihari could be expected to bowl a few overs of spin like we\u2019ve seen today. Will be answering a lot more questions on the #100MBApp. @100MasterBlastr I feel the wicket has quickened up a bit and as time goes by, it will only become harder and have more pace and bounce. #INDvAUS Australia played well in the first session and have surely been more positive today.\nIt\u2019s important for them to continue to bat well in the 1st innings of this Test to stay alive in the series, otherwise it will be a downhill ride all the way to Sydney. #INDvAUS All the best Team India, go out and do your best...Hum aapke sath hai!\n#HumBhiHockey #HWC2018 https://t.co/FxbKHXEdCV Many many happy returns of the day Thalaiva. Wishing you a healthy and blessed year ahead, @Rajinikanth Sir. \n#HappyBirthdayThalaiva https://t.co/4bftVuVpjL The spirit with which you have overcome every obstacle in life both on and off the field is the stuff of legends. Wishing a very happy birthday to the one and only @yuvstrong12! Have a great one.\n#HappyBirthdayYuvi https://t.co/GaMdWG6eUU What a way to start the series!#TeamIndia never released the pressure. Superb batting by @cheteshwar1 with crucial knocks in both innings, @ajinkyarahane88 in the 2nd innings and excellent contributions by our 4 bowlers. This has brought back memories of 2003. #INDvAUS https://t.co/4gmviaKeCC An emphatic win by #TeamIndia to beat Canada 5-1 and make their way into the quarter finals. Well done! #INDvCAN #HumBhiHockey https://t.co/UKn6c7OMn6 As of now, India is in the driver\u2019s seat and all set to take the game away. Australia need to bowl well in the first session tomorrow to stay in the game, otherwise they go to the next Test down 1-0. #INDvAUS Thanks @forbes_india for capturing my Second Innings thus far. The pitch is much beyond the 22 yards, the playfield has changed, the rules are different but the support of my team and well wishers makes this journey special. Looking forward to many more learnings and experiences. https://t.co/SWBZVWcRzH @vinodkambli349 It\u2019s been so many years since we\u2019ve known each other. However, not much has changed my friend. You continue to surprise me even today! \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude1c #TeamIndia should make the most of this situation and not lose their grip. The defensive mindset by the Australian batsmen at home is something I\u2019ve not seen before in my experience. @ashwinravi99 has been very effective and has played a role to help the team be on top, for now. The game is wide open at this stage. The way the new ball is used in Australia in the first 15-20 overs is extremely crucial and could very well have an impact on which way this Test could go. #INDvAUS May this coming year fulfill all your wishes, @imjadeja! Happiest Birthday to you! https://t.co/XuHglSS8EO Happy Birthday, @Jaspritbumrah93! Wish you good health and happiness always!\n#HappyBirthdayBumrah https://t.co/ZcUo58Xvnc It was a gritty innings from @cheteshwar1 under the circumstances.

Spare a thought for their families as they have much to endure along with the players. Time for all of us to take a step back and give them some space. Cricket has been known as a gentleman's game. It's a game that I believe should be played in the purest form. Whatever has happened is unfortunate but the right decision has been taken to uphold the integrity of the game. Winning is important but the way you win is more important Cannot tell you how glad it makes me to know that you are following your dream. All the best for this challenging journey, @ArjunV_everest! #DreamsComeTrue https://t.co/OLndHWKBzG Thank you @KCAcricket for taking the right decision to move the ODI match from Kochi to Thiruvananthapuram.
