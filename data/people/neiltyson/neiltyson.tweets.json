I invite you to read this\u2026\n\nhttps://t.co/VnIS6kuSkS Sun tables for today show slightly more than 12 hours of daylight.\n\nLight bends on entering Earth\u2019s atmosphere from space. The sunrise or sunset you see is the lagged location of the Sun\u2019s refracted light, and not the the Sun itself, adding unearned minutes of daylight \u2014 daily. https://t.co/iUv19Jn6OB @TheWhiskyMaker @symbolium @RichardCheese Caused by the refraction of sunlight entering Earth\u2019s atmosphere from space.  Also, sunrise times reference a different spot on the Sun than sunset times.\n\nCombined, they add multiple minutes of daylight that wouldn't otherwise be there. Astrologically, today is the \u201cFirst Point of Aries,\u201d when the Sun first visits the constellation Aries on the sky. But precession of Earth\u2019s axis over the millennia has placed this First Point of Aries squarely in Pisces.\n\nFurther evidence that astrology is bullshit. https://t.co/A4QrvACGJ4 Oh, and a Happy Nowruz to all who celberate the begining of a new year on the Persian solar calendar. https://t.co/aPeOD7jJXm Merry Equinox to all residents of planet Earth.

I guess my correspondence was not clear enough: I was referencing the claims of intellgent Aliens visiting Earth in spaceships, and not whether there\u2019s chemical evidence of Alien metabolism elsewhere in the universe.

All I did was look it up and paste it into Twitter. An earlier Tweet displays how many digits I actually know. (Did you miss it?)  It\u2019s many fewer than 279. And so ends my #PiDay excursions.\n\nWill now return to my regular programming schedule in the Twitterverse. \ufffc\ufffcOh, and Happy Birthday to Albert Einstein. Born in Ulm Germany on #PiDay, 1879. https://t.co/DLldUrkPEZ Off-season #PiDay Geek humor\u2026\n\nQUESTION:  What do you get when you divide a Pumpkin's circumference by its Diameter?\n\nANSWER:  Pumpkin Pi Seriously Geeky #PiDay Dad-Joke alert\u2026\n\nIn mathematics, Pi are not round.  Pi are squared. I want to eat Pizza at this place on #PiDay.\n\nhttps://t.co/BfYxsxusxV For Algebra Pizza Geeks on #PiDay...\n\nThe volume of a cylinder is\nV = pi  r^2 h\n\nThink of a Pizza as a very short, wide cylinder, and replace some letters \u2014 If pi is just PI, and the Pizza has a radius of Z and thickness of A, then the volume is:\n\n V = PIZZA https://t.co/wYDRO13uw3 Mathematically, your Hat Size is the diameter of your head in inches, if your head were a perfect sphere, on #PiDay. https://t.co/NYBk4KfpaD Not that anybody asked, but\u2026\n \nMeasure the circumference of your head in inches, then divide that number by Pi.

On #PiDay, Pi written as 3.14 can get you far, but it\u2019s missing all the rest of the decimals that make it not only an Irrational but Transcendental number. On #PiDay, sixty-four decimal places of Pi can get you the Observable Universe's circumference down to a sextillionth the size of a Proton. Pi to 32 decimal places.\n\nOn #PiDay, that's it takes for all ten Arabic numerals to appear at least once:\n\n3.14159265358979323846264338327950 On #PiDay, personally, I'm good for a baker\u2019s dozen of digits: 3.141592653589.\n\nEnough to get me Earth's circumference to 1/1000 of an inch. To some, the value of Pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.\n\nTo others, value of Pi is $3.79 at their local diner on #PiDay Pi is useful in Math, Science, &amp; Engineering. It even appears in Einstein\u2019s Relativity\n\nAnd in Geeky kitchens, where Pi Pies are a thing on #PiDay https://t.co/IxiJOkl9HV The \u201cP\u201d sound in the Greek letter Pi evokes \u201cperiphery\u201d.\n\nMultiply any circle's diameter by Pi and you get its circumference on #PiDay @Callout3 Then, I suppose, #PiDay cannot exist in the UK. Sorry. So that we're all on the same Pi-page\u2026\n\nIf you measure the circumference of a (flat) circle and divide it by the diameter of the same circle, you get the value of Pi.\n\nThat value of Pi is the same for ANY size circle you draw on  #PiDay. March 14 (3.14)\n\nHappy #PiDay to all the pi-lingual peoples of the world. A sustained meditation on  #PiDay follows... @gmweiser @HarshPatel2100 No. I don\u2019t have public agendas.

But as I understand it, nearly all cowmilk we consume derives from cows that are kept lactating long after they need milk to nourish their calves. @SwissYooper FYI:  I verified your point of origin before I replied to you.  Had you hailed from Australia or the Far East, my reply would have been different. @HarshPatel2100 Honest, objective truths can land anywhere on the darkness spectrum. Thanks. I should have said \u201cCattle\u201d, so these two clearly won\u2019t be lactating, but will nonetheless likely end up on somebody\u2019s dinner-plate. https://t.co/MpRop4UO7w Nice to see how Cows can be playful in their spare time \u2014 when not being slaughtered for steak or artificially induced to lactate.\n\nhttps://t.co/nhvthtdzNQ @SwissYooper aaaaalmost.

Fascinating (to me) Fun Football Fact:\n\nIf you throw a perfect spiral, with high arc, aerodynamics will force a football, initially pitched upwards, to change angle after reaching its peak height, and pitch downward on arrival into the arms of the pass receiver. https://t.co/MR880pL5Ci Not that anybody asked, but the Raymond James Stadium, home to #SuperBowl LV, is oriented precisely north-south in the Northern Hemisphere.  This means the Coriolis Force from Earth\u2019s rotation will deflect any 50-yard kick, nearly 1/2 inch to the right.  I\u2019m just sayin\u2019. Conversely,  a football inflated on Venus to 13 pounds per square inch (@NFL regulation), when brought to Earth, would instantly explode. https://t.co/kXq2V5umXL If you were to play football on planet Venus, then all 22 players would rapidly vaporize in the high-temperature atmosphere, 50% hotter than a Pizza Oven.\n\nIgnoring that complication, an Earth-inflated football would instantly flatten from the atmospheric pressure \u2014 100x Earth\u2019s. https://t.co/77at28Ctws Proper uses of the word Super:  Super Duper, Supercharged, Super Bowl, Superman, Supergirl, Supernova, Superconductivity, Super Mario.

The #SuperBowl:\n\nMomentum &amp; Energy transfer. Elastic &amp; Inelastic collisions. Spin-stabilized Prolate Spheroids.\n\nAmerican Football is Physics. Is Tom Brady charmed? Born in Menlo Park, CA, just down the road from the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center \u2014 where physicists explore the building-blocks of matter. In 1976, the year before Tom Brady was born, SLAC was awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering the \u201cCharmed Quark\u201d In his career Tom Brady has passed for 91,452 yds (scoring 661 touchdowns along the way.) That\u2019s the equivalent of a single offensive drive against 11 players who try to stop you, on a football field nearly 53 miles long.  About the diameter of the rayed crater Tycho on the Moon. https://t.co/3ZyYxowmii Tom Brady is old \u2014 for a football player.  Back in 1977, when he was born, there were only 107 (out of 118) known elements on the Periodic Table. Tom Brady was the 199th pick in the 2000 NFL draft. Which tells me that occasionally, if not often, people assessing your future potential based on past performance don\u2019t know shIt about anything.

It could be November 1 for you, while time zones to your West are still trick-or-treating. Back in the 20th and 21st centuries, the USA saw eight Halloween Blue Moons: 1906 1925 1944 2020 2039 2058 2077 &amp; 2096. https://t.co/KxYQeQLY6w The expression \u201cOnce in a Blue Moon\u201d is colloquial for \u201cThe thing hardly ever happens.\u201d  But If you meant it literally, then that thing will occur every two or three years.\n\nSo, like most cosmic happenings, Blue Moons aren't entirely rare, even if we want to think they are.

But it\u2019s not. So get over it. Reflections on the statistics of my followers:\n\nNearly (only?) 400 out of 185,000 respondents have been hospitalized for COVID-19. Of course we don\u2019t know how many have died. But for all others, please continue to stay smart, stay healthy, and heed the advice medial professionals Reflections on the statistics of my followers:\n\n7% of you are Vegan/Vegetarian, which is close to the 8% of you in the world\u2019s population.  Meanwhile, nearly 90% are omnivores, I among you. Although lately I consume dead animals no more than about two days a week. Reflections on the statistics of my followers:\n\nMore than 80% of you are non-religious. But one in 14 (7%) identify as having religion as a way of life. You follow me knowing that not all of my content resonates with your views. Thank you for coming along for the ride. Reflections on the statistics of my followers:\n\nOne fourth of you identify as politically Centrist with more than half identifying as Liberal.  So the Conservative voices that arise in my threads, though ardent, are a small minority of all followers. Reflections on the statistics of my followers:\n\nOne in four of you have visited only one, or no other countries in your life. In my experience, it\u2019s always good to do all you can to see how others live \u2014 lest you think your way of life is the only way of life. Reflections on the statistics of my followers:\n\n43% of you know only one Language. I am among you, but only if you don\u2019t count the computer languages I know.  And congrats to the  7% who know four or more languages. That\u2019s badass in every way. Reflections on the statistics of my followers:\n\nDomestically &amp; especially Internationally, more Men use Twitter than Women. Maybe Twitter breeds over-talkers, best suiting male modes of interaction. In any case, my followers are 78% Male 20% Female.  With 1% Non-binary. Reflections on the statistics of my followers:\n \n67% of my followers self-identify as having \u201cLight\u201d skin, and 1% with \u201cDark\u201d skin, which simply tells me I am badly under-represented in Africa. Reflections on the statistics of my followers:\n\nSixty percent of you are fluent in the Metric System. Wow.  Either Americans are successfully inching in that direction, or most of my following is International. Reflections on the statistics of my followers:\n\nConsistent with all users of Twitter, there\u2019s a nearly equal split between City living and the Suburbs, with one in seven of you living in Rural zones - where night skies are filled with stars. Reflections on the statistics of my followers:\n\nAs expected, 90% of my followers live in the northern hemisphere \u2014 \u2018cause that\u2019s where most of the land is. Reflections on the statistics of my followers:\n\nMost of you are half my age or less. More significantly, only 3.5% of my followers are my age or older. That\u2019s half of who in that age group uses Twitter.\n\nI wish I knew what any of that means. Thanks for participating in my two-day, 14-question Twitter Poll.

Credit to Pope Gregory\u2019s Jesuit priests for figuring out the Julian calendar needed updating - before telescopes, and while Christendom was sure the Sun orbited Earth. \n\nFifty years later, Jesuits would prosecute Galileo for saying (and flaunting) that Earth orbits the Sun. https://t.co/2bX20b0wP4 By 1582, the Julian calendar, with a Leap Day every four years, had accumulated TEN extra days relative to Earth\u2019s orbit.  So Pope Gregory jump-started his new and exquisitely accurate calendar by canceling 10 days that year, in which October 4 was followed by October 15. The 1582 Gregorian update to the Julian Calendar prescribes: The century years 1600 1700 1800 1900 &amp; 2000 are all divisible by four, but 1700 1800 1900 were not leap years, yet 1600 &amp; 2000 were. And 2400 will be.\n\nOn February 29, 2000 most had no idea how rare that Leap Day was. The Leap Day alone overcorrects the calendar, requiring we remove a Leap Day every century year.\n\nBut that under-corrects the calendar, requiring we put a Leap Day back in, every four centuries. \n\nBehold the Gregorian Calendar. @BlueIsRue @Snow_Miser_ The week is what\u2019s arbitrary.

Except the length of shadows should have been much longer, extending in front of them, just before crossing to the Moon's darkened far side https://t.co/xgn5PpLWkY The film \"Ad Astra\" loves showing weightless astronauts. But space is not inherently weightless. If your engines fire constantly because you're in a hurry to get to the Moon or to Mars, then the acceleration creates artificial gravity \u2014 at the rear-end of the ship. Always. The film \"Ad Astra\" has Moon Pirates. Moon Pirates? What are they thinking? Buried treasures on the Moon?  If the Pirates knew how expensive it is to be a Pirate in space, they might have just stayed on Earth and become investment bankers. https://t.co/uFRULeSocy In the film \"Ad Astra\", they announce the Moon is almost full, yet a \"blue marble\" gibbous Earth hangs in the sky \u2014 a geometric impossibility.

FYI: There is no cause to blame anything that happens to the star Betelgeuse on @realDonaldTrump @VoilaRevina You nailed it. Indeed, Betelgeuse may have already exploded \u2014  now a ghost, a \"dead star walking\" across the Galaxy \u2014 with the light-speed signal of its demise not yet arrived here on Earth. Betelgeuse is the star's common name \u2014 Arabic for \"Armpit of the Great One\".  Its catalog name is Alpha Orionis. Two thirds of all stars in the night sky with names have Arabic names. An homage to their \"stellar\" navigational skills 1000 years ago, during the Golden Age of Islam. Beginning late summer of 2019, the reddish star Betelgeuse has dropped from the 7th to the 21st brightest star in the nighttime sky.  No need to panic, but If it exploded, the flash would be visible in the daytime, and rival the brightness of the Moon for weeks. https://t.co/KHvJjV3neB Betelgeuse was born about 10 million years ago \u2014 long after Earth's big dinosaurs roamed the land. But the star is now near death. No need to panic, but stellar evolution models tell us that it will likely explode as a Supernova sometime within the next 100,000 years. https://t.co/h7YKSK3nO9 @KidsDrDave Orion was drawn facing away from us for most illustrations of the classical period. https://t.co/KPaSOFbuvn The star Betelgeuse is so large, if you swapped it with the Sun, it would engulf the orbit of Mars and extend all the way through the asteroid belt. No need to panic, but at 700 light years, it's the closest star to the Sun that will end its life in a Supernova explosion. https://t.co/TcDqUmXrNX No need to panic, but the red supergiant star Betelgeuse (yes there is a star with that name), one of the brightest in the nighttime sky, marking the left armpit of the constellation Orion, is mysteriously dimming, having lost 60% of its brightness across the past six months. https://t.co/1jOFtv0nWh @futilexcaliburs @saimkonda Animals \u2014 especially dogs \u2014  have always liked my books. https://t.co/ou29j6YgNO @saimkonda Maybe she wants to read it too?

Leonardo da Vinci first understood why you can see the outline of the unlit Moon when in a thin crescent phase. It\u2019s Earthlight reflected back at us, and is officially called Earthshine.  But I prefer to call it Moonshine. https://t.co/dg0HBpBe41 @strayobject Tides are raised in the physical body of Earth as well.  And they would be 8000x higher.

Jupiter, not so much. Even though the Moon once had rivers (of Lava) flowing on it, the song \u201cMoon River\u201d is cosmically irrelevant. Lunar \u201cseas\u201d such as the Sea of Tranquility, where Apollo 11 landed, are broad, flat, former lakes of lava that were long ago presumed to be actual bodies of water. https://t.co/c5dXolOHfY On Mining the Moon\n\n[Video: 1min 40 sec] https://t.co/GxcPXVDYqx FYI: We measure the Moon\u2019s distance with exquisite accuracy using Lasers &amp; Telescopes combined with Moon-based mirrors placed there by Neil Armstrong during Apollo 11. https://t.co/YQzrboqf9y Earth is 81x the Moon\u2019s mass but only 16x its volume.\n\nWith our large, iron-metal core, we are much denser. The Moon, forged entirely from our Crust &amp; Mantle, has hardly any Iron. https://t.co/n9YtoYsILV Scary Times:\n\nA Mars-sized protoplanet in the early solar system sideswiped Earth, blasting parts of Earth\u2019s crust &amp; mantle into space, creating a ring of orbiting molten rock, which rapidly coalesced to form our Moon. https://t.co/mZOErcyth7 When the Moon first formed, four billion years ago, it was 20x closer than it is today, 400x larger on the sky, and Tides were 8,000x higher. @spencer_mehl The rate is proportional to the inverse cube of the Moon\u2019s distance.  So it\u2019s rate of spiraling away is getting slower and slower. Possible evidence that Cows want to jump over the Moon: To the astrophysicist\u2019s ear, they're actually saying Moooooon. https://t.co/tH7LnTbj7b Since 1972, when the correction was first introduced, 27 Leap Seconds have been added to the calendar, driven primarily by Moon-induced friction from oceanic tides sloshing on the shores. https://t.co/Z4iiVf8LuC Not that anybody asked, but the Moon\u2019s orbit is spiraling away from Earth at a rate of nearly 1.5 inches (4 cm) per year. In response, Earth\u2019s rotation rate is slowly slowing, necessitating a Leap Second to be added to the calendar, every now and then. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, &amp; Friday are named for the Norse Gods: Tiw, Woden, Thor (yes, Thor) &amp; Frigga. But if you reference those days in any Romance language you recover their Classical planet names.

Professionally we call these the First &amp; Last Quarter Moons. Due to some intriguing optical properties of reflection from textured surfaces, the Full Moon is 6x brighter than the Half Moon. @Alloyjane See earlier tweet on Tides. Always wondered why Werewolves transition only upon **noticing** the Moon is Full. Never in the basement, or when there\u2019s a Full Moon during a cloudy, overcast night. https://t.co/omWk5LX628 FYI: Full Earth seen from the Moon is about 60x brighter than full Moon on Earth. Earth is not only bigger in the sky, but with clouds and ice and oceans, much shinier than the Moon, itself about as reflective as the sidewall of a car tire. The Full Moon exerts no more gravity on you than does any other phase.\n\nSo Lunatics have no real excuse. The appearance of a huge Moon on the horizon, juxtaposed behind cityscapes or mountains or trees is called the Moon-on-Horizon illusion.  It\u2019s actually no bigger than when higher in the sky.\n\nYup. It really is just an illusion.

The Qur\u2019an says plainly that daytime fasting during Ramadan ends at \u201cDark\u201d not at sunset. \u201cDark\u201d is a good match for the end of twilight.

As the area of our knowledge grows, so too does the perimeter of our ignorance. If you wield the power to snap your finger and end half of all life in the universe \u2014 to preserve resources for those who remain \u2014 then you surely have the power to snap your finger and double the resources instead.\n\n@Avengers, I checked the math on that one. @nhatier @e_downer @jeffgolenski You don\u2019t **consume** 20 liters of water per day.

And one that glows. @Haroldj111 Estimates fall between 80 and 100 billion. So nearly ten percent of all humans that ever lived are alive right now. FYI:  An average comet contains as much water as has ever been consumed by all humans who have ever lived.\n\nFYI: A garden-variety metallic asteroid contains vastly more gold than has ever been mined in the history of the world. Sure, Thanos is singularly evil.

My man, Isaac Newton\u2019s second law of motion. Maybe our educational system isn't that bad.

Earth, in this image, would be hard to explain to the forces of the universe. https://t.co/YSADdBEILy @T32504 Orbiting objects orbit each other.

So Earth's jiggle is basically an orbit \u201caround\u201d the Moon. @napendergraph All depends on how fast you rotate. All slow-rotating galaxies, especially in galaxy clusters, are round.  And the huge Oort Cloud [Google it] of comets, surrounding the Sun and planets, is spherical. \u201cOn Being Round\u201d \u2014 Chap. 8 of **Astrophysics for People in A Hurry** discusses how the laws of physics conspire across the cosmos to prefer spheres.

In curved space, such as what is described in General Relativity, Pi times a circle\u2019s diameter does not have to equal the circumference.

That\u2019s your Hat size.\n\nMathematically, your Hat size is the diameter of your head in inches if your head were a perfect sphere. So that we're all on the same Pi-page\u2026\n\nIf you measure the Circumference of a circle and divide it by the Diameter of the same circle, you get the value of Pi.
