Credit to Pope Gregory\u2019s Jesuit priests for figuring out the Julian calendar needed updating - before telescopes, and while Christendom was sure the Sun orbited Earth. \n\nFifty years later, Jesuits would prosecute Galileo for saying (and flaunting) that Earth orbits the Sun. https://t.co/2bX20b0wP4 By 1582, the Julian calendar, with a Leap Day every four years, had accumulated TEN extra days relative to Earth\u2019s orbit.  So Pope Gregory jump-started his new and exquisitely accurate calendar by canceling 10 days that year, in which October 4 was followed by October 15. The 1582 Gregorian update to the Julian Calendar prescribes: The century years 1600 1700 1800 1900 &amp; 2000 are all divisible by four, but 1700 1800 1900 were not leap years, yet 1600 &amp; 2000 were. And 2400 will be.\n\nOn February 29, 2000 most had no idea how rare that Leap Day was. The Leap Day alone overcorrects the calendar, requiring we remove a Leap Day every century year.\n\nBut that under-corrects the calendar, requiring we put a Leap Day back in, every four centuries. \n\nBehold the Gregorian Calendar. @BlueIsRue @Snow_Miser_ The week is what\u2019s arbitrary.

Some light is heavily absorbed by common glass - both Infrared &amp; ultraviolet, for example.

FYI: There is no cause to blame anything that happens to the star Betelgeuse on @realDonaldTrump @VoilaRevina You nailed it. Indeed, Betelgeuse may have already exploded \u2014  now a ghost, a \"dead star walking\" across the Galaxy \u2014 with the light-speed signal of its demise not yet arrived here on Earth. Betelgeuse is the star's common name \u2014 Arabic for \"Armpit of the Great One\".  Its catalog name is Alpha Orionis. Two thirds of all stars in the night sky with names have Arabic names. An homage to their \"stellar\" navigational skills 1000 years ago, during the Golden Age of Islam. Beginning late summer of 2019, the reddish star Betelgeuse has dropped from the 7th to the 21st brightest star in the nighttime sky.  No need to panic, but If it exploded, the flash would be visible in the daytime, and rival the brightness of the Moon for weeks. https://t.co/KHvJjV3neB Betelgeuse was born about 10 million years ago \u2014 long after Earth's big dinosaurs roamed the land. But the star is now near death. No need to panic, but stellar evolution models tell us that it will likely explode as a Supernova sometime within the next 100,000 years. https://t.co/h7YKSK3nO9 @KidsDrDave Orion was drawn facing away from us for most illustrations of the classical period. https://t.co/KPaSOFbuvn The star Betelgeuse is so large, if you swapped it with the Sun, it would engulf the orbit of Mars and extend all the way through the asteroid belt. No need to panic, but at 700 light years, it's the closest star to the Sun that will end its life in a Supernova explosion. https://t.co/TcDqUmXrNX No need to panic, but the red supergiant star Betelgeuse (yes there is a star with that name), one of the brightest in the nighttime sky, marking the left armpit of the constellation Orion, is mysteriously dimming, having lost 60% of its brightness across the past six months. https://t.co/1jOFtv0nWh @futilexcaliburs @saimkonda Animals \u2014 especially dogs \u2014  have always liked my books. https://t.co/ou29j6YgNO @saimkonda Maybe she wants to read it too?

So it\u2019s rate of spiraling away is getting slower and slower. Possible evidence that Cows want to jump over the Moon: To the astrophysicist\u2019s ear, they're actually saying Moooooon. https://t.co/tH7LnTbj7b Since 1972, when the correction was first introduced, 27 Leap Seconds have been added to the calendar, driven primarily by Moon-induced friction from oceanic tides sloshing on the shores. https://t.co/Z4iiVf8LuC Not that anybody asked, but the Moon\u2019s orbit is spiraling away from Earth at a rate of nearly 1.5 inches (4 cm) per year. In response, Earth\u2019s rotation rate is slowly slowing, necessitating a Leap Second to be added to the calendar, every now and then. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, &amp; Friday are named for the Norse Gods: Tiw, Woden, Thor (yes, Thor) &amp; Frigga.

Professionally we call these the First &amp; Last Quarter Moons. Due to some intriguing optical properties of reflection from textured surfaces, the Full Moon is 6x brighter than the Half Moon. @Alloyjane See earlier tweet on Tides.

Never in the basement, or when there\u2019s a Full Moon during a cloudy, overcast night. https://t.co/omWk5LX628 FYI: Full Earth seen from the Moon is about 60x brighter than full Moon on Earth. Earth is not only bigger in the sky, but with clouds and ice and oceans, much shinier than the Moon, itself about as reflective as the sidewall of a car tire. The Full Moon exerts no more gravity on you than does any other phase.\n\nSo Lunatics have no real excuse. The appearance of a huge Moon on the horizon, juxtaposed behind cityscapes or mountains or trees is called the Moon-on-Horizon illusion.

The Qur\u2019an says plainly that daytime fasting during Ramadan ends at \u201cDark\u201d not at sunset. \u201cDark\u201d is a good match for the end of twilight. This time of year: up to 15 mins later in equatorial latitudes. 30 mins at middle latitudes. And 45 mins at higher latitudes. I\u2019m just saying. https://t.co/XAseweAIhM During Ramadan, daytime fasting for Muslims ends at sunset.

Farewell John Singleton (1968-2019). @fernandocuri Yup.  I suppose I should have specified Euclidean space. Sometimes I wonder if in Deer Heaven they are outfitted with rifles and hunt Humans. As the area of our knowledge grows, so too does the perimeter of our ignorance. If you wield the power to snap your finger and end half of all life in the universe \u2014 to preserve resources for those who remain \u2014 then you surely have the power to snap your finger and double the resources instead.\n\n@Avengers, I checked the math on that one. @nhatier @e_downer @jeffgolenski You don\u2019t **consume** 20 liters of water per day.  More like 2 liters, I suspect. I choose my words carefully. Caught #AvengersEndgame last night in a private @IMAX screening. All three hours of it.\n\nNever before knew how many @Avengers were actually running around the universe.  Including blue ones and red ones and green ones and black ones. And one that glows. @Haroldj111 Estimates fall between 80 and 100 billion. So nearly ten percent of all humans that ever lived are alive right now. FYI:  An average comet contains as much water as has ever been consumed by all humans who have ever lived.\n\nFYI: A garden-variety metallic asteroid contains vastly more gold than has ever been mined in the history of the world. Sure, Thanos is singularly evil. But I bet he flunked Astro 101.\n\nHe wants to kill half of all living things to save the other half \u2014 due to limited resources.\n\nBut the universe has vastly more resources than can possibly be consumed by civilizations that have access to space.

Lunar eclipses are long and boring, lasting about three hours.  So you could get up to ninety minutes of one crossing into Easter Sunday. Not that anybody asked, but\u2026\n\nEaster Sunday can never have an Eclipse of any kind. Here\u2019s why.

Is it just me, or does Thanos resemble Hellboy \u2014 minus the forehead hockey pucks, of course. https://t.co/xVuvUbY6YQ @AlexMenasche Neither the rotation nor Earth\u2019s gravity would change.  Note also that if the Sun disappeared, we would not know about it for 8 min 20 sec -- the time it takes light and the change in gravity to reach us. @LuisCityCouncil @chasestrangio They\u2019d still be alive on Earth if that darned asteroid didn\u2019t take \u2018em out.

My man, Isaac Newton\u2019s second law of motion. Maybe our educational system isn't that bad.

Earth, in this image, would be hard to explain to the forces of the universe. https://t.co/YSADdBEILy @T32504 Orbiting objects orbit each other.

So Earth's jiggle is basically an orbit \u201caround\u201d the Moon. @napendergraph All depends on how fast you rotate. All slow-rotating galaxies, especially in galaxy clusters, are round.  And the huge Oort Cloud [Google it] of comets, surrounding the Sun and planets, is spherical. \u201cOn Being Round\u201d \u2014 Chap. 8 of **Astrophysics for People in A Hurry** discusses how the laws of physics conspire across the cosmos to prefer spheres.

Had FYI been spelled out, the \u201cF\" sound changes, becoming the first letter of \u201cFor\u201d, then deserving a preceding \u201ca\u201d. Just an FYI: Easter on the Gregorian Calendar contains a double astronomical reference: The first Sunday after the first Full Moon after the Vernal (Spring) Equinox.

I don\u2019t know what that means. ( A Parsec is an obscure unit of distance in Astrophysics, equal to 3.26 Light Years. Neither has anything to do with time. ) Unashamed of inanity, #TheForceAwakens repeats the Millennium Falcon boast of completing the Kessel Run in \"under 12 parsecs\" In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, the starry skies were unfamiliar. As they should be, a long time ago in a Galaxy far, far away In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, apparently Wookiees don\u2019t age, or they age much slower than human actors do. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, the Storm Troopers still run as though they\u2019re carrying a full load of poop in their diapers. Never seen Romanescu Broccoli?  Fractal Earth food befitting a tale of long ago and far, far away. https://t.co/NZDkWpeqOB In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, the lead character snacks on what includes Romanescu Broccoli, nature\u2019s only fractal food. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, once again I felt isolated and inadequate for not understanding Wookiee-speak. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, the energy in a Star is enough to destroy ten-thousand planets, not just a few here &amp; there. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, if you were to suck all of a star\u2019s energy into your planet, your planet would vaporize. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens the TIE fighters made exactly the same sound in the vacuum of space as in planetary atmospheres In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, BB-8, a smooth rolling metal spherical ball, would have skidded uncontrollably on sand. I guess I did just demote R2D2 to \u201cDwarf Cute\u201d status.  No hard feelings though. In @StarWars #TheForceAwakens, BB-8 is waaaaay cuter than R2D2.

Reached Pluto in 9 years. #PlutoFacts: As reported in the @NYTimes in 1930, when discovered, Pluto was presumed to be the size of Earth. #PlutoFacts: Pluto would fit comfortably between New York &amp; Dallas. Between Rome &amp; Moscow.  Between Perth &amp; Melbourne. #PlutoFacts: The moons Ganymede Titan Callisto Europa Io Titan &amp; our Moon are all bigger than Pluto. Get over that one too. #PlutoFacts: In the @Disney pantheon, Goofy wears clothes, is bipedal, owns a home.

At the (slow) rate the Moon is tidally locking Earth, the Sun will die before it succeeds \u2014 a more important concern for all. Contrary to Pink Floyd's 1973 album-cover proclamation, there is no Dark Side of the Moon. A day there simply lasts a month. Earth has already tidally locked the Moon, which is why it shows only one face to Earth - the \u201cnear\u201d side. The Moon\u2019s Motivation: Luna is desperately trying to slow Earth\u2019s rotation so that one Earth day eventually equals one Month. Leap Second around the world.  Arrives in 30 seconds.

Done only on June 30 &amp; Dec 31. June 30th's leap second will manifest as an extra second in the last minute of the day, Greenwich time. ( 7h 59m 60s  PM  ET) The Moon continually tugs on Earth\u2019s rotation, slowing us down bit by bit. To compensate, Tuesday, June 30 gets a leap second Name-calling is what happens when you desperately want to argue, but you are in fact inarticulate.

You want chubby babies to fly for real?  Give 'em ten foot (3-meter) wing-spans, like Condors, which weigh the same.

For Algebra Geeks: If the thickness of a pizza is A, and its radius is Z, and pi is just PI, then its volume is V = PIZZA. In other words, if the crust of a 14-inch pizza is 1-inch wide, then the next 1-inch band occupies 30% of the topping's area. If the cheese on a 14-inch pizza falls just 1-inch shy of the crust, the pie is missing 30% of the cheese that could be there A 14-inch pizza is 154 square inches of food.  Nearly twice as large as the 78 square inches of a 10-inch pie. Odd that pizza is sold by the inch, but consumed by the square-inch. This fact confuses assessment of pricing and toppings. @MikeonTV (What do you have against the Moon?) Nothing much would happen. Its gravity would keep both halves nicely connected In Math, dividing by zero is \u201cundefined.\u201d So why doesn't @JohnAllenPaulos define the thing so I can return to my calculations @chrisweitz Happy to assist artistic creativity. Especially when the cosmos serves as the artist's muse. What's the question? Okay two more legit Alien IDs: If you are of Mercury you are Mercurial. And if you are of Jupiter, by jove, you are Jovian. Last one: The Latinized name for Earth is Terra. If you are human \"of the Earth\" you are Terrable. (Just kidding, Earthlings) Want More? The Moon's Latinized name is Luna.  If you are \"of the Moon\u201d youre simply \u201cLunar\u201d.  Lunatics are something else.. Not that anybody asked, but the Sun's Latinized name is Sol.  If you are \"of the Sun\" you are simply \u201cSolar\u201d. Venus is the Roman goddess of love &amp; sexuality. And so medical doctors assigned Venereal - \u201cof Venus\u201d to all related diseases Ceres is the Roman goddess of agriculture and grain crops, which indeed gives us our breakfast word Cereal --  \"of Ceres\". Gotta give you that one @elakdawalla.  If you\u2019re from the Dwarf Planet Ceres, you\u2019d surely be Cereal. https://t.co/e5SiAycXvD From Venus? Then you\u2019re Venusian. But the proper term is Venereal. Unfortunately Doctors nabbed it before Astrophysicists did And it seems to me that any life forms we discover within Jupiter\u2019s icy moon Europa would rightly be called Europeans. Seems to me, if we discover any life forms from the Vega star system (constellation Lyrae) they'd rightly be called Vegans. JUST POSTED: @StarTalkRadio\u2019s \u201cCombating Disease\" with Pres.

Relativity. Gravity. Quantum. Electrodynamics. Evolution. Each of these theories is true, whether or not you believe in them.

GPS Satellites are pre-corrected for General Relativity, allowing them to beam us the accurate time for Earth\u2019s surface. GPS satellites, located farther from Earth\u2019s center than we are, keep faster time than do our clocks on Earth\u2019s surface. In #Interstellar: And in the real universe, strong gravitational fields measurably slow passage of time relative to others. In #Interstellar: There\u2019s a robot named KIPP. One of the Executive Producers, a physicist, is named Kip. I\u2019m just saying.

So \u201cAlpha\" Centauri is the brightest star in the constellation Centaurus. And \u201cBeta\" Pictoris is the 2nd brightest in Pictor. Apart from common names, stars are generally ID'ed in order of brightness within a constellation, using the Greek alphabet. The Southern skies have the closest star system to the Sun - the famed \u201cAlpha Centauri\u201d  The 3rd brightest in the night sky. Earth is closest to the Sun during the Southern Hemisphere Summer. For the North, that of course coincides with our winter. Many big telescope in the North have twins in the South, giving astrophysicists coherent full-sky coverage of the Universe. Just an FYI: Earth\u2019s South Magnetic Pole is actually in the North. That\u2019s why the North tip of a compass needle points there. The center of the Milky Way \u2014 a target of study for my PhD \u2014 passes directly overhead for all middle southern latitudes. \u201cArctic\" derives from Arktos, the Greek word for Bear.

Sundials designed for the North won't work in the Southern Hemisphere. If ported there, they would reckon time backwards. In the North, the shadow of a sundial\u2019s gnomon sweeps clockwise. That\u2019s, in fact, what defined clockwise in the first place. Some of us in the North are jealous that 100% of the world\u2019s population of free Penguins live in the Southern Hemisphere. @arrowsails Yes. Earth is not only oblate \u2014 wider at the equator than pole-to-pole, but pear shaped \u2014 slightly wider just south of the equator Earth's centrifugal force at the Equator renders everybody and everything about 6% lighter than they\u2019d weigh at the poles. At a revolution speed of 1,700 km / hour, the equator is Earth\u2019s fastest moving part. All other latitudes move more slowly. I think it's cool that there's a country on the equator with the name \"Equator\". Better known in Spanish as Ecuador Antarctica\u2019s subglacial Lake Vostok is a body of water, trapped in ice, that hasn\u2019t seen air in at least 15-million years.

At Santa Fe Studios, in New Mexico, while filming #Cosmos, I never grew tired of looking at the Chairs http://t.co/DAKBm4BJnN At #AMillionWays party in Santa Fe, I re-met @KaleyCuoco from @BigBang_CBS. Friend of @SethMacFarlane http://t.co/HOE6bDPhnQ At #AMillionWays party in Santa Fe, NM #Cosmos was invited, along with some friends of @SethMacFarlane http://t.co/XesK3OaUz1 Trivia: #AMillionWays filmed near Santa Fe, New Mexico at the same time as #Cosmos, enabling @SethMacFarlane to visit our set The film #AMillionWays to Die in the West would be numerically accurate if named A Million Occasions to Utter the Word F%&amp;K Apart from a badly oriented full moon, I give #AMillionWays an \u201cA\u201d for its sweeping &amp; romantic portrayals of the night sky. Was ready to count up to 1,000,000.  But #AMillionWays short-changed me. It showed only twenty-two ways to die in the west. The block of ice portrayed in #AMillionWays would weigh about 2.5 tons. Enough to squash pretty much anything it fell on. \"I know Why the Caged Bird Sings\u201d - In the cacophony of life, a voice that will not soon be replaced.

Our postponed 9-10pm (ET) Cosmos hour has come to an end. \"Tune in next week\"  for Ep 11: \"The World Set Free\" on @FOXTV. Now that @NASA isn\u2019t launching SpaceShuttles, would be cool if @NASCAR allowed drivers to attach unused solid rocket boosters Spoilers increase the effective weight (traction) over a car's rear wheels at high speed \u2014 without increasing the car's mass. If the Charlotte Motor Speedway increased their banking angle from 24 to 31 degrees, the cars could do the turn at 200 mph. If you travel faster than 165 mph on the 24-degree bank turns at Charlotte Motor Speedway you will skid into the embankment. Rubber tires on asphalt grant a maximum speed of about 165 mph in the 24-degree banked turns at Charlotte Motor Speedway.

Neck-snapping acceleration of 0-60mph in 3.9sec. http://t.co/tLiS7m0LjE At 200mph, a nice @NASCAR speed, it\u2019d take 1200hrs (50days) to drive to the Moon. And drivers would never need to turn left. I'm quite sure I'm the last person in the universe to have learned that RACECAR spelled backwards is RACECAR Cosmos postponed a week for NASCAR. During the 9-10pm ET time slot, I suppose I'll tweet the physics of fast-moving things. Always a good sign: My 2004 book \u201cOrigins\u201d coauthored w/ D.

Apr13: On this date in 2029 stadium-sized asteroid Apophis buzz-cuts Earth at 45,000 km/hr below our communication satellites Hmmm. I understand that some people want to call this eclipse the \"Blood Moon\u201d. If it\u2019s red, I\u2019ll be thinking of rose petals. Lunar Eclipses are visible from the entire Earth hemisphere facing the Moon. That\u2019s billions &amp; billions of people  : - ) Those who don't know a Lunar Eclipse is in progress will likely mistake Earth's shadow for the Moon going through phases. At 3.5 hrs, Total Lunar Eclipses are long &amp; boring. Wait for the Moon to enter the deepest part of Earth's shadow: 1:58am ET. Total Eclipses occur every couple of years or so. If anyone calls them \"rare\", ask if they feel that way about the Olympics. Dust in Earth's atmosphere can tint sunlight, casting eclipsed Moons in a deep red light. But often the Moon just gets dark. After midnight Monday ET, the Full Moon ambles deep into Earth's projected shadow in space: Behold a Total Lunar Eclipse. Attention StarGazers: Watch for the \"Income Tax\" Lunar Eclipse, beginning Mon night 12:53am ET (Tue Morning).
