Is closing polling stations about making it harder for minorities to vote, or is it because of budgets? If you say it\u2019s because of your budget, let\u2019s talk. I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot. I\u2019m a fanatic about voting. Most people call closing polls voter suppression. Some say it is \u201cbudgetary.\u201d What if I made it easy &amp; solved the budgetary issue?

I was lucky enough to star with her and direct her, and her talent was off the charts. She had such a big heart, she was a wonderful wife and mother, and my thoughts are with John and the whole family. And he did so much. I have been lucky enough to meet a lot of my heroes, and I was so lucky to add Ephraim to that list, not once, but twice. I hope that his children grow up knowing what a great man their dad was. All of us can learn from his example. He had such a big heart, he loved his family more than anything, and he was constantly giving back and coaching kids. He had the best attitude, choosing to focus on what he could do rather than complaining about what he couldn\u2019t. When we met for the first time at the Special Olympics in South Africa 19 years ago, and when we met again last year to catch up, Ephraim talked about how much I inspired him. But if I had to say who left each meeting more inspired, it was definitely me. I just heard the news that my friend Ephraim passed away. My thoughts are with his family, and I hope his wife and children can take comfort in knowing that Ephraim isn\u2019t gone- his inspiration and energy lives on with all of us who knew him. https://t.co/lGuZSVLthk Happy birthday, America.

Good eye! This time I brought LuLu too. https://t.co/4KLxA9eLV1 @SamWangPhD I like your style Professor! @VVforDelegate Thank you for working to terminate gerrymandering! This has been a passion of mine since my first attempt in 2005 in CA so I love when I see other good government reformers trying to make government work for the people. @breaddrink1 I have fought against gerrymandering in Democratic states and Republican states. The issue is not partisan for me. But to answer your question, the Democratic Party controls the VA legislature and Governor's office. All eyes are on Virginia, and I urge the General Assembly to support the amendment. I want to thank my friends from @1VA2021 for tirelessly fighting day after day to #terminategerrymandering. This amendment is the only way to truly prevent the legislature from rigging district lines in the future, and time is running out for lawmakers to act. Gerrymandering has always been a bipartisan problem, and it requires a bipartisan solution. I hope the General Assembly will support the amendment as they did in 2019. Virginia is at a crossroads, and the General Assembly is left with 2 options: a constitutional amendment with broad support, or an advisory commission that will not prevent the legislature from drawing their own district lines. This is an easy choice. https://t.co/KqohoeHuNm RT @WorldWarZeroOrg: JUST ANNOUNCED \u2014 @JohnKasich, @JohnKerry, @Schwarzenegger, and @EAlexTheGreat are coming to @Otterbein University on S\u2026 It was fantastic to meet with @DennisCulhane from @AISP_Penn, who is one of the best minds in the nation when it comes to our homelessness crisis.

Never. I left that day with a stomach so full I was about to pop. But I also left with a full heart, because I saw the best of America. And let me tell you: firefighters can cook. I ate one meal after another because I didn\u2019t want to be rude, and when you have a chance to eat with your heroes, you never say no. At Ground Zero, I saw them working through tears and hugged more heroes than I could count. At the three firehouses I visited, they just wanted me to work out and eat with them. They were exhausted and they were in mourning, but they just kept going because they were serving a cause bigger than themselves. I will always remember visiting the first responders in New York less than a month later. I was there to help pump them up after their tragic, non-stop work. But they were the ones who inspired me. Today we remember. We remember the victims, their families, and the heroes. We remember the way the country came together and stood as one.

The solution is taking the power to draw their lines away from the politicians and giving it to independent commissions, as states around the country are doing. I will continue to fight for reform across the country, in Republican and Democratic states. To my fellow Republicans who say this doesn't matter, remember that the tables can turn. For years, Democrats were the leaders in gerrymandering efforts, and President Reagan called gerrymandering \"anti-Democratic and un-American.\" One person/one vote is a vital part of our government, but gerrymandering allows politicians to pick their voters and scam the system and the people don't get the representation they deserve. In West Virginia, Democrats received 41% of the votes for the U.S House, but 0% of the seats. In Arkansas, Democrats received 36% of the votes for the U.S House, but 0% of the seats. In Pennsylvania, Democrats won 54.1% of the State House election vote, but 45.8% of the seats. In Virginia, Democrats received 54% of the State House election vote, but 48% of the seats. In Illinois, Democrats won 61% of the votes for the U.S. House, but 72% of the seats. Also in Wisconsin, Democrats won 54% of the votes for State Assembly, but 36% of the seats. In Wisconsin, Republicans won 46% of the votes for the U.S. House, but 63% of the seats. In Ohio, Republicans won 52% of the votes for the U.S. House, but 75% of the seats. In Texas, Republicans won 50% of the votes for the U.S. House, but 64% of the seats. In North Carolina, Republicans won 51% of the votes for the U.S. House, but 77% of the seats. In Maryland, Republicans won 32.5% of the votes for U.S. House, but only 12.5% of the seats. Gerrymandering deprives Americans of all parties of their representation. Instead, we get mis-representation. I\u2019m going to share some examples in this thread so you know exactly why I fight for reform and #FairMaps. https://t.co/EVsSC34QSU @Midgard8_3 By creating independent commissions that draw the districts instead of letting the politicians draw their own districts. Instead of being distracted by television ratings, let\u2019s fix our politics. The only way to drain the swamp is by letting the voters pick their politicians, instead of continuing to let the politicians pick their voters. #terminategerrymandering https://t.co/EVsSC34QSU I\u2019m still here.

The water was dirty by the time it was our turn but my brother and I weren\u2019t going to schlep back to the well. Here\u2019s a flashback.

We\u2019ll have another chance to schmooze soon - where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way. @ledbettercarly I agree. I would love to know the process. But it needs to improve. I\u2019m, of course, upset about Andy\u2019s omission. He was a groundbreaking producer who showed that independent filmmakers could make blockbusters like Rambo, Tombstone, Total Recall, Terminator 2, &amp; the list goes on. His movies created many thousands of jobs in Hollywood over decades. Last night was one of the best @TheAcademy Awards shows I\u2019ve seen. Fantastic performances, smooth flow, and almost a perfect show. The only failure was leaving film icons like Andy Vajna, Carol Channing, R. Lee Emery, Dick Miller and others out of the In Memoriam tribute. The VA lawmakers truly deserve praise and recognition for passing this bill. They willingly gave some of their power back to the people. I hope other legislators around the country take note. This is a great victory for Virginians and all Americans. Politicians, it is time to wake up. We will #terminategerrymandering all over the country. Don\u2019t be caught sleeping. https://t.co/25iIuyXdSf This year, we have plenty of water.

Remember that throughout our history, people from different backgrounds, races, and political parties have come together to defend America. Emulate them. Remember we are all on the same side. Never forget. It is easy to be offended. It is easy to lash out. It is easy to think of Americans with different views as the other side. But that is the path of weakness. @DanCrenshawTX showed us how to be strong, how to do the hard work of coming together, how to rise above. As we observe Veterans Day today, I can't stop thinking about the grace and courage @DanCrenshawTX showed on @nbcsnl this weekend. He taught all of us an urgent lesson that can help us through our current divisions. https://t.co/ch1TPpfmfZ I always tell people I am not a self-made man.

The constitution starts with \u201cWe the people,\u201d not \u201cWe the politicians\u201d and I will stand on the side of the people and support every effort to #TerminateGerrymandering. I want to thank every person I met who worked on these campaigns, all of the volunteers, and those of you who donated your hard-earned money to help achieve victory. You inspire me. Earlier this year Ohioans passed their own reform. We have the momentum. The rigged scam of gerrymandering is 200 years old, but these states join California and Arizona in telling the politicians that you don\u2019t get to pick your voters any more - we pick you. Whether you rooted for a blue wave or a red wave, the biggest wave last night was the people\u2019s wave. And it swept through our country. Three states - MI, CO, and MO - reformed their redistricting process and we are waiting on results from UT. #TerminateGerrymandering Thank you. Hopefully soon, it will be hasta la vista to gerrymandering everywhere. https://t.co/zKz6paja2u Congratulations Colorado and each and every one of you who campaigned to #TerminateGerrymandering!

That\u2019s Barbara in a nutshell, and I can imagine her saying the same thing right now. Barbara, your friendship means the world to me. Thank you for your never-ending inspiration. She put everyone else before herself, but let me tell you: when Barbara talked, you listened. Once, at Camp David, she broke her ankle while we were sledding, and I will never forget her response. She\u2019s strong, she\u2019s smart, she\u2019s classy, and she\u2019s unfailingly kind and giving. She is a public servant in every sense of the word. I will always be grateful to her. She welcomed me and treated me like family, she motivated and advised me, and she was always there for me. Barbara Bush is a truly great American. She might be best known as the wife of one President and the mother of another, but those of us who know her well know that she could have easily done the job herself. Thank you all for caring.
