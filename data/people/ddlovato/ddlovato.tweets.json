Most of us have chosen sides during the past several years and added to the conversation - AS WE SHOULD HAVE - memes and all - But I personally am just tired of living in a divided country Remember when we didn\u2019t all think the same? (It\u2019s still happening) Opinions differ - I wasn\u2019t \u201ccommanding\u201d anyone to do anything. Now go out and celebrate or meme IF YOU PLEASE - DO YOU - all I\u2019m saying is hatred DIDN\u2019T work for the last administration \u270c\ud83c\udffc Look, y\u2019all do what you want. I don\u2019t normally tweet because it pisses someone off but I stopped caring a long time ago. Just trying to spread love and light today... after all that is what we fought for right? Today isn\u2019t about celebrating in the face of those that oppose your views and values, but celebrating from a place of LOVE - combating the hate that has encompassed and oppressed so many of us the past four years. Let the healing begin. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc This was OUR election and WE WON TOGETHER. There\u2019s still a lot of work to be done, but today we will celebrate each other.

I'd rather lose fans and stand up for what I believe in rather than be a bystander. #sorrynotfuckingsorry that what is going on is WRONG. And if you are an American not using your voice to stand up for what is right, you are wrong too. It also saddens me to watch as people refuse to say anything on this matter. Regardless of what political party you are for, you can't deny My heart continues to break the more I watch the news. The hate was one sided and it hurts for people to say otherwise. So much for facts. Happy birthday to one of my closest friends @joejonas. Love you tons and tons! Tonight we're talking real issues at the #WeRiseTour in Nashville.
