Smaller districts in New Hampshire, North Dakota, Texas, Ohio, Indiana and elsewhere say their delivery dates have become moving targets. AP's investigation found that school districts in at least 15 states were waiting on orders for Chromebooks and other equipment. Among them are some of the biggest in the country: Los Angeles; Clark County, Nevada; Wake County, North Carolina; Houston and Palm Beach, Florida. The supply of laptops can't keep up with exceptionally high demand. It's the same reason that toilet paper and other pandemic necessities flew off shelves a few months ago. The world\u2019s three biggest computer companies, Lenovo, HP and Dell, have told school districts they have a shortage of nearly 5 million laptops, in some cases exacerbated by Trump administration sanctions on Chinese suppliers. As millions of American kids start the school year virtually, school districts are facing a laptop shortage and long delays in orders, particularly for the low-cost Chromebooks popular in K-12 schools across the country. Paramedics inject the drug ketamine into people as a sedative, often at the behest of police who believe suspects are out of control.
