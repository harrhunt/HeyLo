Seemingly 17 year old Michael and 19 year old Ashton had written the song we\u2019d been looking for. We made the video for it with frank borin. And the rest was history. So we rolled with the concept. I came up with the drum part. That spired from a rudiment I practiced. Michael and I recorded the demo pretty fast with Jake. And went home without thinking twice about the song. We thought it was terrible at the time Jake instantly plays us the chorus he\u2019d already written on a nylon acoustic guitar. He sings \u201cshe looks so perfect standing their in my American apparel underwear\u201d Michael and I think. Wow that\u2019s fucking stupid. But at the time our A&amp;R were big on \u201clyric twists / gimmicks\u201d Michael and I walk into the studio in Venice CA. Which happens to be butch walkers studio. By the bathroom is a plaque for 15 million record sales of PINK\u2019s success. Massive. 10 am. I\u2019m living in LA and Liz and security guard Dave are driving our mini van we rented to get around to sessions that Capitol records were booking for us. we were so excited to work with Jake Sinclair, he\u2019d worked on weezer, and panic at the disco. Happy 7th birthday to our first ever hit song SHE LOOKS SO PERFECT. Here\u2019s the thread \ud83e\uddf5 of the creation and writing process.
