https://t.co/BH3e8jMOUR Plane ventilation systems typically mix fresh air from outside with the air already in the cabin\n\nMany ordinary air-conditioning systems recirculate the same air, more often, to save energy\n\nhttps://t.co/DnIqDhUUev https://t.co/yWJDyO6Eev But, what about a plane?\n\nThe air on a plane may well be better quality than in the average office (and almost certainly better than
