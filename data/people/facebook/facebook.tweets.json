For any posts from candidates and campaigns that try to declare victory before the final results are in or try to delegitimize the outcome of the election, we'll add a label that directs people to official election results from Reuters and the National Elections Pool We'll remove posts that include clear misinformation related to COVID-19 and voting. If the content uses the virus to discourage voting, we will attach a link to our COVID-19 Information Center and will prohibit that content from being run in ads. Advertisers will be able to continue running ads they started running before the final week and adjust the targeting for those ads, but those ads will already be published transparently in our Ads Library so anyone, including fact-checkers and journalists, can scrutinize them. In the week before the election, we won't accept new political or issue ads. Campaigns will still be able to run ads, like get out the vote efforts, but in the final days of an election there may not be time to contest new claims. We\u2019ve previously announced we\u2019re running the largest voting information campaign in American history -- with a goal of helping 4 million people to register and vote. In just three days last month, we drove almost 24M clicks to voter registration websites.
