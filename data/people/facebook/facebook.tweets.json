Thank you. -NW Even with the challenges of going back to school, Peter and Anthony understand their need for one another, and that together, they can tackle whatever comes their way. https://t.co/iHHuLcYfbr Peter is now a parent himself to his adopted son Anthony. He feels their time together in quarantine has been a blessing. And with the new school year beginning, they\u2019re not just remote learning, they're learning about each other, too. https://t.co/vlZiVgqS7I After leaving an abusive home at age 10, Peter eventually found a parent figure who took him in. He moved to the US and became a citizen, deciding to pay it forward by becoming a foster parent himself. In the last three years, Peter has fostered 13 kids. https://t.co/sRSAvkduxZ This year, back to school is new school. People are redefining how they learn, how they teach, and how they make school happen. Today, we\u2019re featuring Peter M. a single Dad from Charlotte, NC. https://t.co/FBhtA5ogI8 Despite the challenges of being furloughed and keeping doctor appointments, she\u2019s found that taking things day-by-day helps her to not feel so overwhelmed. https://t.co/e0lgvls8pu Artiesha enjoys being more hands on with her kids\u2019 education. And even with all the challenges her family faces, she feels they\u2019re closer than ever. https://t.co/CJVYnLMGhc Artiesha has a lot on her mind right now. With one child starting kindergarten and another going into fourth grade, she\u2019s concerned about keeping them safe and healthy. All while battling a breast cancer diagnosis she received a couple months ago. https://t.co/okTzAHYF67 This year, back to school is new school. People are redefining how they learn, how they teach, and how they make school happen. To highlight this, we're showing different perspectives on how people are dealing with this change. https://t.co/msWVk7my4i As Mark said, \u201cThis election is not going to be business as usual.\u201d We\u2019re committed to enforcing these new policies along with our existing ones to ensure that people have the information they need to make their voice heard where it matters most -- at the ballot box. For any posts from candidates and campaigns that try to declare victory before the final results are in or try to delegitimize the outcome of the election, we'll add a label that directs people to official election results from Reuters and the National Elections Pool We'll remove posts that include clear misinformation related to COVID-19 and voting. If the content uses the virus to discourage voting, we will attach a link to our COVID-19 Information Center and will prohibit that content from being run in ads. Advertisers will be able to continue running ads they started running before the final week and adjust the targeting for those ads, but those ads will already be published transparently in our Ads Library so anyone, including fact-checkers and journalists, can scrutinize them. In the week before the election, we won't accept new political or issue ads. Campaigns will still be able to run ads, like get out the vote efforts, but in the final days of an election there may not be time to contest new claims. We\u2019ve previously announced we\u2019re running the largest voting information campaign in American history -- with a goal of helping 4 million people to register and vote. In just three days last month, we drove almost 24M clicks to voter registration websites. This morning Mark announced our latest efforts related to the U.S. elections, which are designed to help encourage voting, ensure people have accurate info about voting, and help reduce confusion and post-election uncertainty: https://t.co/BaGkItq0A1 @dmccaulay Great question, Diana.

Some stories have suggested we were shipping over private messages to partners, so we wanted to clarify a few things. They were clear to users and only available when people logged into these services with FB. We had strict rules in place over how partners could use APIs and what data they could and couldn't access. The partnerships were experimental and ended years ago. But we publicized the features then because we wanted people to use them: https://t.co/DtZOGljU4z. \u201cDelete access\u201d meant that if you deleted a message from within Spotify, it would also delete from FB. At the time, in order for you to write a message to a FB friend from within Spotify, for instance, we needed to give Spotify \u201cwrite access.\u201d For you to be able to read messages back, we needed Spotify to have \u201cread access.\u201d These experiences are common in our industry \u2014 think of being able to have Alexa read your email aloud. Here\u2019s an example of how it worked if you used Facebook on Spotify: https://t.co/2Zryf4Ck0R We worked closely with 4 partners (Spotify, Netflix, Dropbox, Royal Bank of Canada) to integrate messaging into their products so people could message their FB friends \u2014 but only if they chose to use FB Login In the past day, we've been accused of disclosing people's private messages to partners without their knowledge. That's not true \u2013 and we wanted to provide more facts about our messaging partnerships https://t.co/28cAbkoINx @Mejonu Hi Mejonu.
