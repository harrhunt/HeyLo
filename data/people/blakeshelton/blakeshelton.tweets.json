I certainly DO NOT want to be responsible for holding up anyone\u2019s tix refund especially right now! Hey guys we are working on this ticket refund thing. There\u2019s a lot of vendors involved and it\u2019s a web for sure and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any one persons fault. It\u2019s been a nightmare and confusing year for everyone at every level. Bottom line is the tour IS and HAS been cancelled since March... Get your money back people. Let me know on here how it goes over the next few days. This is terrible. That\u2019s a fair point but it was only our first statement while we were scrambling like the rest of the world... Look above the IG post. Cancelled. https://t.co/xKsvXZYUXc https://t.co/1KuM5klTqg That\u2019s where these things get confusing and tricky and out of our hands.. But what\u2019s right is right and that money belongs back in the buyers hands.. Especially in these times. The tour is cancelled. https://t.co/7xurehtP05 I understand what you\u2019re saying.. The problem is something has been sold to people that doesn\u2019t exist. Trust me when I say EVERYONE involved knows that tour is cancelled and WONT HAPPEN AGAIN. The money HAS to be refunded. https://t.co/rviXU64sRz Man... This is bad I agree. We in NO WAY want mislead or delay people getting their refunds. We absolutely CANCELLED the tour. NOOOO ticket money is being held up on our end. The issue is on that end. This is awful. https://t.co/evoWGaLZZh We have addressed this before but you must have missed it. That show along with ALL the rest of the Friends and Heroes tour have been CANCELLED. Not sure who you bought your ticket through but that must be the issue. https://t.co/SDe969QtAb Doing a happy dance!!!

Thank you god!!!! https://t.co/rWmVEpmXM2 What a truly devastating loss. I loved Mel. I will miss him terribly. My thoughts and prayers to all his family. He did his best to try and keep my head on straight. I looked up to Mel more than he could've possibly known. A talented songwriter. An incredible entertainer. And a funny funny guy. It has been a couple years since I saw him last. I deeply regret that now. He once spent an entire day at his place in Tennessee showing me all the memorabilia he'd gathered over the years where he gave me a pair of his stage boots. He even took time to talk me through some hard times in my life on a couple phone calls. Some of my most cherished memories are the times I spent with Mel Tillis. Many many great memories. From fishing, to just having a beer, to him crashing my concert! Good luck to my friend @Elliott_Sadler today!!!! Go get that championship buddy!!!
