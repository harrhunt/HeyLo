I want to continue the conversation of what justice looks like so we can continue to\u00a0heal I know that I cannot simply solve injustice by making music but I do know that if we all do our part by using our gifts to serve this planet and each other that we are that much closer to being united Suffering, injustice and pain can leave people feeling helpless. Music is a great way of reminding each other that we aren\u2019t alone. Music can be a way to relate to one another and connect with one another In a time when there\u2019s so much wrong with this broken planet we all crave healing and justice for humanity. In creating this album my goal is to make music that will provide comfort, to make songs that people can relate to and connect to so they feel less alone #JUSTICE the album March 19th.

Furthermore, I would never seek to silence anybody. I\u2026 Every claim of sexual abuse should be taken very seriously and this is why my response was needed. However this story is factually impossible and that is why I will be working with twitter and authorities to take legal action. I won\u2019t be using mike lowery anymore as an alias On march 10th selena left for work and I stayed at the Westin as the receipts clearly showed with my friends nick and john before I left town. Once again not at the four seasons. We booked it for a couple days to stay for the defjam show but I bailed on the 11th to head back home https://t.co/Ku15SCYz91 The Pics I showed of me and Selena march 9 in Austin  should make it clear that we were together that night and went from the venue to our Airbnb and never went to the four seasons. This is our airbnb receipt where we crashed with our friends https://t.co/4ZDIqjeCIQ We have also confirmed with the Four Seasons regional manager that I was never on property on the 9th of March 2014 and never a guest on the 9th or the 10th and I welcome all press to inquire with them if needed or wanted. Furthermore I stayed with Selena and our friends at an airbnb on the 9th and on the 10th stayed at a Westin because our hotel reservation at L\u00c0 Quinta and not the four seasons was messed up. Here are the receipts for the hotel on the 10th https://t.co/hLNHnvJ6XS However I never stayed at the four seasons on the 9th or the 10th. This person put another tweet up earlier saying they saw me at the restaurant the following night not the hotel https://t.co/K4WHNRlC6k The other reason this story might say I was staying at the four seasons was because a tweet from 2014 on March 10th not the the 9th says they saw me there . This is that tweet https://t.co/piTHxjajvi Here is article that shows we didn\u2019t arrive in Austin that night from Selena\u2019s show in Houston until late in the night. https://t.co/BsxCoMasqa These photos clearly show me on stage with my assistant sidestage and the other with both of us in the streets of Austin afterwards on March 9 2014 https://t.co/WlC6KAvJOZ This article from 2014 talks about Selena being there with me. https://t.co/Jr2AE0brY2 As her story told I did surprise a crowd in Austin at Sxsw where I appeared on stage with my then assistant side stage and sang a few songs. What this person did not know was that I attended that show with my then gf Selena Gomez In the past 24 hours a new Twitter appeared that told a story of myself involved with sexual abuse on March 9, 2014 in Austin Texas at the Four seasons hotel. I want to be clear. There is no truth to this story. In fact as I will soon show I was never present at that location. Rumors are rumors but sexual abuse is something I don\u2019t take lightly. I wanted to speak out right away but out of respect to so many victims who deal with these issues daily I wanted to make sure I gathered the facts before I made any statement. I don\u2019t normally address things as I have dealt with random accusations my entire career but after talking with my wife and team I have decided to speak up on an issue tonight.

Today is a good day When are we gonna be the kind of people that find joy in adding value to one another and not tearing each other apart.. And rather than try and make people feel accepted and loved you find things to pick apart like the world isn\u2019t full of that already.. we can find something negative to say about anything or anyone And rather than being positive you belittle people. Think about how awesome it felt for me to be on that stage after being away for so long the excitement and joy it gave me doing the thing i love the most, i sang to to backtrack like most cameos do this is a normal thing, @Morgan_Stewart imagine if you spent even half the time you spend laughing at other peoples expense actually building people up and encouraging people how much positivity you could bring. What hurts about this is the fact that you have a platform to make a difference @Morgan_Stewart just saw a video of you ripping me to shreds saying I was lip-syncing. They played the song and i just sang overtop of it.. regardless why spend your time tearing people down. It\u2019s People like you that are bullies at school that are making kids suicidal.
