Take the\u2026 Two very fine young batsmen on view in this game. Babar Azam climbing the heights, Ollie Pope taking early steps on that journey. See how many no-balls are being called. That is why it was always going to be a good idea to have the 3rd umpire looking out for them. We always marvelled at the upright seam heading towards the batsman. Like Sreesanth or, now,  Shami. This is the era of the scrambled seam..... You can see already see why Pakistan do well in England but not quite in Australia. In these conditions, their bowling is a handful. And you can see why anything above 300 was a good score Excellent from Pakistan and Shan Masood. Any runs above 300 will hurt England greatly. Shouldn't lose if they get 350 with the bowling side they have picked. @thecalvero Doesn't cost anything to hope! @ShuBho03 Not in Colaba.

And so they know. It was never about telling them, it was always about calling. If you don't call, it is a legal delivery and the bowler can repeat it on the understanding that it was legal.

But because of the free hit in white ball cricket. A missed no-ball costs a batting side note @singhrk61 No. Ever since the front foot no-ball came in all those years ago, the batsman hasn't had time to change his shot. Makes no difference As it should be now. Front foot no-balls in white ball cricket to be adjudicated by technology.

Interesting too that the timing of the #ICCWorldCup2023 has been changed from Feb/Mar to Oct/Nov to ensure that two major ICC tournaments aren't played within a few months of each other. Makes sense. @anirudhkowtha Think it through. Not difficult The postponement of the #ICCT20WorldCup formally opens up a window for #IPL2020. Important to know that the IPL was not the reason for the postponement but that the situation with Covid and it's implications for Australia created a window that didn't exist earlier. It was inevitable. The #ICCT20WorldCup has been postponed. Taking 15 teams to one country, handling quarantine and all that comes with it was always going to be impossible to manage.

England can't lose this. My guess they will look to get 65-70 in 10 overs and set about 280-290 in 85-86 overs. West Indies must keep England batting more than 16 overs.

Some umpires disagree but I think it will help the game https://t.co/BhQ0N99RYz @anandvasu What I meant was different. If the umpire doesn't call a no-ball, the bowler is entitled to believe he is bowling a fair delivery and keep going that way. It is not about being warned. Point about being behind is valid but if the umpire doesn't call, you think you are behind Brilliant result for an understated, determined West Indies side. Excellent test match. This has been good for our game. Too many responses here have missed the first line \"if umpires don't call no-balls...\" They are meant to. If they don't, the bowler will think he has bowled a fair delivery and continue that way. https://t.co/FLz11R8pXz Wasn't to be a century but what a brilliant innings from Jermaine Blackwood. Kept easing the pressure with shots which is so important in a close run chase. @nandan_16 @iAnsh_95 Exactly If umpires don't call no-balls, there has to be some way of telling a bowler that he is going over. Hard on him if he gets a wicket and finds it is a no-ball if he has no indicator that he was getting close. One of the aspects that separates top cricketers from good ones is how they play the big moments. Ben Stokes, in spite of that T20 World Cup in 2016, is among the best at such times What is \"imperial\"? I used to know an outdated FPS system.... https://t.co/hvAhbatZpX How many of you keep multiplying the speed shown on screen by 1.6 to figure out what it is in kmph? When the West Indies 2nd innings began, I thought the key players would be Hope, Chase and Holder because of their ability to hang in and soak in the pressure. One is out, one is in and one is to come. Pretty open at this stage. Maybe England just marginally ahead Chasing blues for the West Indies? Tense session ahead.......

Two people with similar paths and yet vastly different https://t.co/U4yfKGN4Tu A very happy birthday to the solid, elegant and polite @ajinkyarahane88. Top team player, top person. Hope to see lots of you at the crease this year. A bit concerned at the options available for middle order slots in test cricket. But the separation gets more and more distinct. Really, only need to import Kohli and Jadeja into the T20 team and Bumrah and Rohit into the Test team. T20 : Rohit, Rahul, Shreyas, Pandey, Pant, Pandya, Pandya, Chahar, Bhuvi, Chahal, Bumrah. Add on: Dhawan, Karthik, Washington. Need left handers in the line-up to counter match-ups. Many more options for the T20 side than for the Test side. Test : Agarwal, Shaw, Pujara, Kohli, Rahane, Vihari, Jadeja, Saha, Ashwin, Shami, Ishant. Add-on Gill, Yadav, Kuldeep. Depending on conditions, a 15th in Saini. Since MSD hasn't played for a while and I am not privy to his plans, I don't know about his availability or form. Look at how many more people can slot into the T20 team. Surya Yadav, Samson, Gowtham, Axar, Ishan Kishan, Prasidh Krishna, Rahul Chahar, Shreyas Gopal, even young Riyan Parag. The experienced CSK duo of Jadhav and Rayudu. I think it is very unlikely that India will play a test match and a T20I on the same day because the season isn't as crunched as elsewhere. But if it did happen, here are likely teams. And they look pretty good.

Getting there Going Live on #90sWithHarsha now #90sNostalgia 1.The Decade of Tendulkar.The confidence.The aggression.The youthfulness.The trust. In an India that was opening up,@sachin_rt stood for what was possible. Perth, Chennai, Auckland, World Cup 96, Capetown, Sharjah, Melbourne. Sachin became part of us. #90sNostalgia #90sWithHarsha 2. The World Cup quarter-final of 1996. The most tense, the most viewed event of its times. India didn't move from the TV screen. Prasad vs Sohail,Jadeja's onslaught,Sidhu's innings,calming Kumble. The high of the QF, the shattering low of the SF #90sNostalgia #90sWithHarsha 3. A world record for Kapil Dev. We couldn't have dreamt an Indian fast bowler would stand atop the cricket world. @therealkapildev showed the way for the next generation by making the new ball a weapon. #90sNostalgia #90sWithHarsha 4. Pakistan tour of India in 1999. That great Chennai Test, @anilkumble1074 with the magical all ten in Delhi, full houses, tense cricket with some of the biggest names from both countries. India-Pakistan also played a lot of odi cricket in the 90s. #90sNostalgia #90sWithHarsha 5. TV rights were sold for the first time. Hero Cup was a legal battle &amp; a cricketing event. The value in Indian cricket started getting unlocked. Professional TV prod came to India. Cricket grew beyond Doordarshan. ESPN, then Star Sports arrived. #90sNostalgia #90sWithHarsha 6. The spectre of match-fixing. Suspicion grew in our game, in whispers then more loudly, trust was injured. The second half was a low point,the darkness before the dawn. It passed too.\u00a0 #90sNostalgia 90sWithHarsha 7. The arrival of @anilkumble1074, #Dravid, @SGanguly99, @vvslaxman281. First glimpse of @virendersehwag. Set the scene for a lot of joy in the next decade. The formative years were wonderful to watch. Leaves were sprouting, the flowers would bloom. #90sNostalgia #90sWithHarsha 8. India's historic tour of South Africa in 1992-93. ANC wasn't yet in power, India still had no diplomatic ties, no visas, we knew little about SA cricket and life there. Was a journey into the unknown. Pathbreaking tour, cricket wasn't great. #90sNostalgia #90sWithHarsha 9. Tigers at home, lambs overseas. Won/drew every home series, lost/drew every away series except Sri Lanka 1993. Tendulkar's first away win outside Asia was 12 years after debut. #90sNostalgia #90sWithHarsha 10. Advertisers like #Pepsi with #NothingOfficialAboutIt #YehDilMaangeMore and other slogans taking cricketers into non-cricket homes via entertainment and investing money into Indian cricket. Significant part of making Indian cricket rich.\u00a0 #90sNostalgia #90sWithHarsha All set for a Twitter Live chat on #90sWithHarsha. Lots of questions. Much to chat. #90sNostalgia .

You have to feel for the associates who will be hit the most if there is an ICC vs national boards tussle. But remember places like the West Indies, Afghanistan, Ireland, Sri Lanka and to a lesser extent, New Zealand will be affected too in the inevitable prioritisation. the T20 World Cup to India which I see India resisting. These are troubled times for everyone but especially for smaller nations that depend on ICC payouts to survive. I see national boards struggling to prevent lead players from playing in the 2-3 lucrative leagues there are The key is what happens with the T20 World Cup. If that can't be played in October in Australia, it opens a window for the IPL which is a source of revenue for a national federation at the expense of an ICC event. If India is ready for cricket, there will be pressure to switch Interesting that Australia and India are open to playing a five test series later this year if conditions improve. In these financially troubled times, I foresee cricket boards protecting their financial interests even if it means conflict with the ICC.

The very very sad stories coming out of Italy are a reminder to everyone else and us, in India, that we cannot drop our guard even briefly. Let us all follow the advice being given to us. Even a few silly actions can ruin all the good work. Have gone with fielding skills generally. Cannot look beyond Rahul Dravid when it comes to catching purely. Wadekar, Venkat, Yajurvindra Singh, Akash Chopra, VVS Laxman. Also tough to look past Kohli as an all-round fielder. Thanks for the inputs. Keep them coming https://t.co/KDn4QBLZRA I had heard a lot about Adhikari but can't find references to back it. Tony Cozier told me the 1952-53 side to the West Indies was an unbelievable fielding side.

I'll stop hassling you with memories now. Here is one last list. Three players you didn't see live but would have given anything to watch. Top of your head, without analysing. Go emotional. Nostalgic. Mine are \n1. Sir Garfield Sobers\n2. Subhash Gupte\n3. Keith Miller In retrospect, I should have included Bobby Narasimha Rao. Kanwaljit Singh and Shivlal Yadav were close. Close to the top of the list of players I admired would be Arshad Ayub https://t.co/GjD1haa7XZ So, while we are fooling around, here are the 11 players from Hyderabad that I loved watching the most. Make your list for where you are from. Pataudi, Jaisimha, Baig, Abid Ali, Nagesh Hammand, Mumtaz Hussain, Shahid Akbar, Saad bin Jung, Azharuddin, Anantha Vatsalya, VVS Laxman @aniket_survase Haha, thanks but by the time Brett Lee appeared, I was beyond copying anyone's action!! Maybe there was an element of fragility about these three. Either inconvenienced in some way, or fidgety at the crease. In either case, it was an emotional connect rather than a hard core cricketing reason. But then, that is how we watch sport! https://t.co/G6mlGuavK3 @madani_dev Solkar was a close 4th for me Abid Ali of course was our local hero. Tried his heart out, hardly ever ducked at backward short leg &amp; ran cheeky singles. We were convinced he could bowl the sur-sur-batti (the ball that never left the ground) on demand. We would watch him in senior division cricket &amp; just gape https://t.co/G6mlGuavK3 I don't know how much time I have spent copying Chandra's action. Walking in almost to a rhythm with his hands together in front of his chest and then that flurry of hands as he delivered a bewildering concoction. https://t.co/G6mlGuavK3 As kids we would go to watch the Moin-ud-Dowla tournament. One year I got a pavilion ticket and Tiger was sitting a few metres behind. He was in next. And I was turning back as often as I was watching the game! https://t.co/G6mlGuavK3 @edwinrodrigues I don't think that is a secret Edwin!

Just an observation that hopefully will help in the food supply chain remaining intact. Already vegetable and fruit markets are inaccessible. Hope we don't get into a situation where producers are worried about produce building up and consumers aren't in a position to access it. Hopefully it will get sorted soon because these are unprecedented times for everyone Am concerned that delivery boys of online groceries are not able to deliver.

Time to stay humble and keep working at it. Still need to bat a day and a half to save the test There are a lot of people doing outstanding work. There will always be slip-ups, yes, there will always be more that people can do, but do remember we are a colossal country and so the more we self govern, the better off we will all be. I think we should all pause for a while to contemplate the kind of effort needed for a country our size &amp; with our population to seal entire cities, stop all transport, close down offices,track down potentially vulnerable citizens, go door-to-door tracing people. #AllInItTogether RT @BloodDonorsIn: #Lucknow\nNeed #Blood Type :  B-positive\nAt : SGPGI Hospital. \nNumber of Units : 2\nPrimary Number : 8052091149\nSecondary\u2026 RT @vikramsathaye: Kids removing entire days frustration now !

How many do you know? @australia @visitmelbourne\nhttps://t.co/ui6OsJQCC6 RT @rohitdbrijnath: Greg Baum on the final. Superb. https://t.co/L4k8ScqrW2 And India, well played to get to the final. It was an excellent campaign till today. Look forward to more Australia are deserving winners of the #ICCT20WorldCup. And they produced a spectacle at the MCG. 86k here. It has been magnificent for the women's game. Just brilliant to see how Australia raised their game on the big day. They have played at a different level today whether with bat or ball or, so visibly, in the field! I believe the Big Bash has played a big part and that is why I believe a woman's IPL is a necessity. I actually believe India did really well to get to the final without a major contribution from either Mandhana or Harmanpreet. For India to win, those two needed to have big tournaments. Hence my opinion that there is enough here to be optimistic about. Was a very good campaign till it lasted. Very different surface for the final. India's strength lay in the spinners suffocating the opposition on a slow turner. This is a far truer wicket and that brings Australia into the game much more 184 is an excellent score anytime but especially in a World Cup final. Australia will be favourites from here especially after Shafali's early dismissal. Alyssa Healy is making a statement here. She is also saying, push the boundaries back. Next stage in women's cricket. Alyssa Healy off to a flier. But she is playing with fire here..... The MCG getting ready for the final. And for @katyperry! https://t.co/PxRg3Cst0M Pitch report by @irbishi and @nassercricket says it is a very good surface. Will challenge India's four spinners but they have been the stars of this tournament. Expect them to come good. Clearly both teams wanted to bat first on the big day. Big toss for Australia. But this Indian team is perfectly capable of chasing down targets. Great atmosphere at the MCG.

The question though is one of ambition. W4 L9 is the best an Asian team has done in SENA but given the resources, India must aim higher. It didn't help that India lost two key tosses but good on Kohli to say that he won't look at that as a factor New Zealand outbowled India in spite of Bumrah's fire in the 2nd test and Ishant in the 1st. But the decisive factor was the absence of opening partnerships that sets the scene for everyone else. Very disappointing. In the series preview on @cricbuzz, I thought NZ were marginally ahead but this was  overwhelming. NZ remain an excellent team at home Clinical New Zealand do what their opponents couldn't.

On the face of it, New Zealand well ahead. But India must believe they can stretch this to 200 and make a game out of this. That is how test matches are salvaged 200 should be the first target. Vihari, Rishabh and Jadeja should believe they can change the game. But this New Zealand attack is relentless India's bowlers have done really well to cancel out the first innings. Still enough in this track to make batting challenging. Big 30-35 overs coming up The many dimensions of Ravindra Jadeja on display today.

If this game does go into a 5th day, then there is a ray of light. But at this stage it is improbable India might have made heavy weather of the conditions which, exactly as anticipated, have made batting easier. But you have to hand it to New Zealand who played this with both, intelligence and resolve. New Zealand way ahead now. For India to have a chance Rahane and Vihari need to take the lead to above 100, then hope Pant plays the kind of innings we know he can. And Ashwin and the others chip in. But 250 ahead from here, which is what is needed, seems too far. Without grabbing the headlines, de Grandhomme is playing an important role for NZ. Bowling his overs economically and keeping a fast bowler fresh all the time. Exactly what I was thinking about. The 3rd umpire would have needed conclusive evidence that Pujara is not out. I thought there was nothing to suggest the ball had brushed glove, no evidence, so would have always been not out. But then I'm not an umpire!! https://t.co/gS3a8B7KM1 New Zealand might have seized the advantage with the way the tail wagged. But so far, India's batsmen, in their own style, are clawing back.

I was talking about the balance in India!! Where 6,7,8 become all-rounders almost and allow India to be better balanced. Like New Zealand is here with their fifth bowler who bats. Would appreciate feedback on #CricBuzzChatter with @Sdoull. It is the first time we are doing it long distance but it is always good to hear from a person on the spot. He is quite a private person so this will be interesting from @Jaspritbumrah93. Look forward to #spicypitch https://t.co/pdRaBor6qQ In any case, it will require a huge 2nd innings effort from India's batsmen. But teams have done that before in New Zealand where the tracks slow down as the game progresses. New Zealand ahead in this test but not by a huge amount. Interesting talking to @Sdoull and he thinks a lead for NZ upto about 120 keeps India in the game. @peter_quill18 Not about him at all. About extra bowling options in different conditions @ACricfanatic You are going to find India is a bowler short @SharanRa0 Don't know you so don't know what kind of person you are but that is a horrible, horrible thing to say. Don't go there. Maybe sport isn't for you. Stay happy. Look how home advantage works. In NZ conditions, you can play de Grandhomme at 7 and he gives you runs and valuable overs. Even wickets. Not much use here where the balance flounders while India can play Jadeja, Saha and Ashwin at 6,7,8 and voila, the balance appears. India conceding too many runs off the back foot. Williamson and Taylor playing this perfectly for now. @DarenGanga Oh Daren, you always speak so fondly about family. And you were optimistic after his return from treatment. I know how it feels.

Baaten confuse mat karna! @adityakumar480 No brainer. Bowl first Another session to New Zealand. But the first innings of a test match there is about hanging in and squeezing out runs. Rahane, Pant and Ashwin need to get India to 250. @sidvee Not about Pant being a bad player. It is the principle of not picking your best for his role.

He is a key component of this bowling attack with his ability to bowl a long spell. Don't get me wrong. This isn't about Pant. Just think in tests you pick your best five batsmen, best four bowlers, best keeper and think about a secondary skill for number six, if at all. I hope he does well because he is a gifted young player but feel for Saha. #Lastword. https://t.co/OJwatdbLeb Just up and see Saha is left out.

Young Naseem Shah has again highlighted the fast bowling crop they seem to harvest. In spite of modern cameras, you can still have consecutive frames that hide a decision in between. Jurel and Ankolekar both outside the crease in one frame, both within it in the next! Outstanding innings from Yashasvi Jaiswal. Held this Indian innings together in the face of an excellent performance from the Bangladesh bowlers. Will be an achievement now to get to 230 Tough going for India on a slow pitch.

Probably doesn't have an option just now Kuldeep Yadav is interesting. Last year at this time he had taken 5 wickets in a test and was proclaimed as the no 1 spinner in overseas conditions. Maybe the selectors aren't convinced by his current form or they think he isn't fit enough or that they expect unfriendly surfaces This is just a hunch, am not an expert in these matters, but I think Shubman Gill will have a career in the middle order, rather than as an opener, in red ball cricket. It would be interesting to see what he regards himself as. I thought the absence of Rohit and the form of KL Rahul would lead to a comeback for him. But clearly the selectors want him to do more in red ball cricket and have gone with those at the top of the queue.

Excellent as India were, New Zealand's back-up was found wanting. 3-12 in a 160+ run chase. Bumrah is back to his best. Love his calmness. Thrice in three matches, New Zealand have had the game in their grasp. Each time India have found a way to drag it back. One of India's learning objectives was to win batting first. That has been the biggest gain from this series How do you struggle in a 164 run chase with a 34 run over in it..... The game isn't over till Bumrah has overs left.....

If the ball is indeed holding up, as it seems to be, 163 might be tougher than it seems Look at the effect of wickets, even in T20.

Kohli, Rahul, Iyer, Samson, Pandey, Dube, Washington, Thakur, Chahal, Saini, Bumrah. Rohit for Kohli and Pant for Iyer in the last game. And Kuldeep for Chahal if fit. Something caught my eye while seeing the scorecard of the India vs England women's T20 international. India didn't concede a single extra run. That is 20 overs without a wide ball. Wonder how often it has happened before. If New Zealand ever wanted a feel good venue it is this. They have won their last six T20 internationals at the Westpac Stadium in Wellington. Keep an eye out for the wind. It is the windiest place I have been to Looks like this match is done. Who knows what another year brings. Fear this might be the last of Federer at the Australian Open.

I thought his innings in Bengaluru against Australia was a little too flashy, a little jumpy. This was far better, dominant and in control. With @klrahul11 and @ShreyasIyer15 on either side playing like this, it takes a lot of pressure off Virat. Those two were magnificent in an excellent run-chase. And two key players no one will talk about were Chahal and Bumrah. @AltRapier Not disappointed with the win @KamalGk1 Not a good contest Great atmosphere in the @cricbuzz studio. With @ImZaheer and @gbhimani in English and @virendersehwag, Ajay Jadeja and @gauravkapur, in Hindi. Many theories, live comments and with Gaurav, great food. If a team makes 200 in a T20 game it should be an achievement. If it is chased down easily, then there is something wrong with the ground; either the surface or the size. Still like 170-175 games the best. Made it look easy. Had said India would win in 19.4. May not go that far! The fielders must deliver two wickets most days. Guptill has produced a big one. Still, India in with a chance. 203. Most days good score. Here, maybe about 10 over par? No more, I think. New Zealand are getting runs from overthrows in the last over..... Runs available wherever you want them here. New Zealand are showing that they know the angles at this peculiarly shaped ground. And Chahal in the deep showing it takes time! India need a solid last couple of overs India have missed a few wickets by letting the non-striker stray outside the crease. Ad shoots are loooong days.

Luxury to have a player who can bat anywhere. 99 scores of 50+ for Virat. Like flipping an omlette. Spreading a dosa. Just another day, really. Could be looking at 350 here Quite simply, Kohli has to play at no 3. Just love how he constructs an innings.

His T20 record is still very good. Just two keepers in the list, by the way. The biggest news in the awarding of central contracts is that there is none for MS Dhoni; which suggests, as some fear, that he may have come to the end. Would love him to have a big IPL with CSK though. And after that......who knows!

Seems to me, it would have been an ideal opportunity to try out Samson again. @TestSpecial @Dracarys28 Because his performance in 2019 was top drawer! Look forward to watching it https://t.co/U7Dk4BNAJX So Kusal Perera plays the test innings of 2019, among the finest ever played, but by the start of 2020, isn't good enough to be in the test squad. There, in a nutshell, is the issue with Sri Lanka. So many fine players unable to go to the next level. Well done. Good to see we agree! @cricbuzz! https://t.co/QsuAoltZqA I can understand the coach saying AB de Villiers has to earn his place back in the South Africa T20 team. It has to be that way for everyone.

Was good catching up with all of you. Maybe another time too All the key performances today came from India. My two moments to remember were Navdeep Saini's yorker at 147 kmph to Gunathilaka and Kohli's six to finish the game. Afraid Sri Lanka were outclassed today. I think they need Mathews to bat at 4. His presence will allow Kusal Perera to play with a lot more freedom There is an aura about @benstokes38 now. Quite simply the standout test match all-rounder of our times. Like all great players, he makes things happen. A little flourish for Sri Lanka at the end but the batsmen have still left the bowlers a bit too much to do. India ahead at this stage. Stokes on one screen, Bumrah on another. Different game, different styles, two modern champions. With the seamers bowling so well (the yorker from Saini was one for the ages) Sri Lanka have to attack Kuldeep, which is exactly what he prefers. Meanwhile, a proper test match thriller in Capetown. England marginally ahead. Early days in this game but Avishka Fernando has a lot of class about him On air now.

KL Rahul 31 innings, 1262 runs @50.48 and SR 141.95 + keeper. (Kept for Kings XI in 7 games in the IPL) Pollard 36/149. Russell 38/182. AB last kept 3 yrs ago except as stand in when de Kock was injured in a test match. I can understand, and I did anticipate, the outcry over not having Babar Azam in my T20 team of the year in spite of his breakout year in 2019. Picking him as the 2nd opener means leaving out Pollard/Russell for a wk (AB hasn't kept since Feb '16). Or weakening the bowling. @Muhammad_Alam23 Kept for Kings XI in the IPL But that would be a different team. The best T20 team in the world would be different from the best T20 team of 2019.

Watch some super tips on #bodylanguage from @bhogleharsha only on\u2026 It is a huge concern for India that none of the top four bowling picks can bat well enough and nobody in the top six can deliver 7-8 overs. And so, in the absence of Pandya, Jadeja must play. There just aren't enough 2-in-1 players going. @RjSriram15 Why do you say so? Absolutely top innings from Hetmyer. His ability has never been in doubt, it was organising an innings that was. And he has done that very well today. India's total is 287, not 288. The no-ball (for height) on which Deepak Chahar was caught, counts as one (for the no-ball). Because the batsman was ruled not out on a review, the run scored off the bat wasn't counted (the fielding side would have thought the player was out) @tarun_imandi No, the total is 287 Dew could be a factor but given the slowness of the surface 287 is a good score. But we have to do something about these over-rates The drama around Jadeja's run-out obscured the fact that the West Indies bowled really well at the death. 26 minutes to the scheduled close. The West Indies need to bowl another 12 overs!! One of the better innings I have seen from Rishabh Pant. Seems restrained and yet is better than run a ball. Hopefully this partnership with Iyer is a peep into the future of India's middle order batting. There is an ad for \"elite lungis\" here! Even heard of elite honesty, but what is an elite lungi! This is a lazy, Sunday afternoon brunch kind of pitch Bit surprised that India are playing both Shivam Dubey and Kedar Jadhav. Backing them to bowl 10 overs between them.

Add to this, Keemo Paul, Hayden Walsh, Oshane Thomas and a right handed top order bat (King?). Really enjoyed calling today's game. The Wankhede Stadium commentary box is one of the best viewing boxes in India. A very happy birthday to @vishy64theking, someone I have enormous regard for. @MikeHaysman Acting? Amazing stat that man of the match KL Rahul's 91(56) was the slowest innings in the Indian team among those that got off the mark. And it was at a SR of 162!! One of the highlights for me today was the incisiveness that Mohd Shami provided to the bowling. Interesting that only one Indian player, Rohit Sharma, has played more T20 games at the Wankhede Stadium than Kieran Pollard. It is one of the most difficult grounds in the world to defend and there is dew but surely 240 should be enough! Anyone know if there is something Virat Kohli can't do on a cricket ground? Was a big call to send an under pressure Rishabh Pant to bat. India have shed their conservatism and come hard upfront. And it is thrilling to see. Already, this has been extremely watchable cricket Very good toss to win for the West Indies. But this is the real challenge. The numbers favour the team batting second for a reason. Won't be surprised if India play an extra seamer at the expense of a spinner today. Most likely Shami. But to win, the batsmen have to cut the six hitting deficit with the West Indies.

I thought the chase would be more difficult. Yes, the ball was a bit moist, but can't let that take away from an excellent West Indies run chase Afraid the fielders have to support the bowlers better. India have, unusually, dropped too many lately Only Rishabh Pant has managed to get off to a good start today. Not the easiest surface. These might be enough unless there is a lot more dew Like Haydn Walsh. And brilliant in the field. This might not be an easy surface to chase on. Sometimes it needs one hit to get going. Holder gave Dube a short one and he has teed off since. Was 12(14), then 35 off the next 10 And the banner says \"Thiruviratapuram\". Nice. The team goes into a huddle and the crowd erupts \"We want Sanju\".. Huge cheer around the stadium as a player walks out in training gear.. No, it isn't Virat Kohli. It is Sanju Samson!

The bottom handed over mid-wicket and the last one over cover. Breathtaking! This West Indies team is willing to be in-your-face. We haven't seen that before. Will be interesting to see if this was a one-off or this is how it is going to be I could see these last two shots from Kohli, especially this flick for six, every single day When teams have made 200+ batting first in a T20 international they have won 69 out of 80 such games played so far.

I feel a strange power within me! https://t.co/QtPc5Ae0WI Now that Karnataka have lost two early wickets to Ashwin, I'm very keen to see how Padikkal responds. This is a test for the young man 22 yards is the distance between the stumps. Cricket is actually a 19 yard game, or even lesser, since the ball only travels the distance between the two creases. https://t.co/5tDIv5zs5F The speed is real, the batsman's ability to anticipate can give him/her more or less time https://t.co/Qm9QdaPi3h The earlier measurements were like that. They measured the time the ball took to reach the batsman (I think they might even have had a speed gun that was used for cars) and went the standard distance/time= speed https://t.co/Te3lNuVOS6 Haha! We tend to judge pace by a batsman's reaction. You and me will make a ball look quicker because of the slowness of our reaction. When a batsman is in position early (that is a skill), he makes the ball appear slower. https://t.co/pfBgRLzlw6 The release speed. Thereafter it will lose speed because of air resistance and then, because of friction when it lands. So when we say \"hastened off the pitch\" we actually mean it lost less speed. Obviously a lot will depend on the nature of the surface and how rough the ball is. https://t.co/9RWz8ssmqX @BuzzMateus Yes, I don't know how far he will go in terms of numbers but he will be seen as a special talent My hypothesis: since the pink ball has more lacquer,therefore more gloss,the subsequent reduction in air resistance could cause it to reach a batsman earlier than a red ball for the same release speed.Would appreciate a more scientific explanation for the pink ball moving quicker Excellent from @FOXCricketLive to show how much a ball loses speed on its way to the batsman. At least 20km/hr. So the ball that leaves the hand at about 140 (which is the speed displayed) actually reaches the batsman at about 120. @azazmani Just something to laugh over. Nobody should take it seriously Okay, here is a fun poll since so many of you talk about it. Do you believe in commentator's curse? @Sanjog_G @cricketaakash @davidwarner31 Would have been at least 65-70 mins to get there. Read somewhere that they were worried about weather. Babar Azam might have missed a century but unlike a few others in recent times, Pakistan have the real deal. You never can tell the future but yes, he will become a special player. The ebbs and flows of test cricket make it so special. Suddenly Pakistan are batting freely, Australia stumbling in the field.....But you need a good session for every bad session and Pakistan have had too many bad ones in this Test. That is why I keep saying that the @IPL is the world's biggest cricket festival. This, from @davidwarner31 about how @virendersehwag told him he would make a better test player than T20 batsman when they were together at #DelhiDaredevils  https://t.co/1bsboaG73J Indeed. And Priyank Panchal and Abhimanyu Easwaran. Luckily there is a good pool of fast bowlers too. Now if only we had a few more seam/swing bowlers who could bat at 6/7. Especially in T20. https://t.co/d3A7pKN49C Well, that answers it. Not surprised https://t.co/0zNpWqzoCn Interesting to see what Australia do here should Warner be within sight of 400. Australians normally put individual landmarks second. Will need to score 700 if they have to wait for Warner. Will they declare and say they have enough? Which they will have. A 300 is special. @davidwarner31 is making up very quickly for a lean Ashes. And spare a thought for Yasir Shah who is about to go past 200 again @akileshsri That is encouraging! @BEDISUMIT I wouldn't go that far.

But deductions come into play only if more than 120 overs have been bowled https://t.co/GQzI2vP6eI @ProfDeano The Bangladesh batsmen were very late on the ball. This will give us a better idea of how difficult it is to bat. Bangladesh quicks against Indian batsmen. So far batting has looked a very hazardous profession @Uday47 The stadium takes 65k @CricketJarvis No it doesn't Mehidy Hasan is a concussion substitute for Liton Das. That means Das is out of the game and Mehidy, as a like for like replacement, will not be allowed to bowl. Long time since I have seen two batsmen backing away from fast bowling so much The bowling has been excellent again but @Wriddhipops has been simply sensational behind the stumps. Bangladesh have been poor and now they have lost their best batsman on view, Liton Das. Hopefully for him, the scans show he is fine and he can continue. This is a journey into the unknown for everybody. No one really knows how the game will pan out. And so, instincts will be critical.

It is time to nail down that position and end all debate on it. Wonder what the situation with Navdeep Saini is. He looked a bit raw in T20 cricket but was hoping to see him in ODIs. Shivam Dubey's bowling in Nagpur has earned him a spot but good to see Kedar Jadhav hasn't been forgotten. Like Rishabh, he will need runs. And really looking forward to seeing Bhuvi in action again. Hard on Sanju Samson but I guess he is much better off playing games rather than just travelling around. Big vote of confidence in Rishabh Pant but the team will expect more from him. Okay Kolkata, here we are. Give us a game to remember. #PinkBallTest @nitnamby Never claimed I did! @moizuddinAhmed9 I didn't see the dismissal.
