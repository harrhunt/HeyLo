The pluses for India were the arrival of players like Suryakumar Yadav and Ishan Kishan, the utility of Shardul Thakur, the overs from Pandya. But none more so than the return of Bhuvi. This was an invaluable series for India So what do people think about Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli opening the batting for India in T20 cricket! And given that Virat will open for @RCBTweets too, maybe this is where we will see from here onwards. @roshanabbas Shukriya bade bhai! Good to see, he's back. Hopefully all good. https://t.co/nugPaLLsGh As we thought, Virat isn't on the field. He was struggling while running. A great fielder, Chris Jordan, has just made a very tough chance look ridiculously easy. And it won't even go against his name in the scorecard!! Rohit Sharma's pull? Or Virat Kohli's hook. Seen the best of both this evening Not surprised that India have chosen to play an extra bowler. Five is always a risk. Acknowledgement that the team is confident of Shardul and Washington at 7/8. But all eyes on Rohit and Virat. How's that for an opening combo!! Excited about today's game. Hopefully no dew and a thrilling, completely fair contest from that point of view. Still five bowlers or a sixth? Budget for the dew and leave a spinner out? Both Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav to play? Big day, Rohit's day? More pace from England?

The last of those is so important. @anshkansal @KadakiaVicky And \"upstairs\" can't tell you with certainty 9 times out of 10! We have had lots of violent twitter outbursts over that too... @KadakiaVicky And replaced by? @pranay_karnik The issue isn't a blurred picture. It is the extra dimension which, for some reason, nobody is inclined to understand! Ah, a measured response! As things stand, it is mandatory. It is a grey area, almost impossible for an umpire to judge. But an \"unsighted\" call is very difficult to resolve with even the best cameras. Everything looks not-out! We may not like it but there is no solution for now https://t.co/nz82wmlQAG I thought the ball touched the ground &amp; said so on air. This tweet was to explain why a soft signal was introduced in the first place &amp; why technology is not yet ready to give conclusive answers in most cases. This time I felt there was enough evidence but most times there isn't https://t.co/kOR3DXzvYW @bhakt_hdl @MontyJBR No Pretty good score but the dew will work against India. England will fancy chasing this The reason an umpire has to give a soft signal is documented. On the replays, even clean catches look not out because it is a 2D image of a 3D event. Hence, umpires look at whether the fingers are under the ball. It is a grey area but tech has no answer for now. Need 3D cameras? It IS mandatory! https://t.co/FmTJEgTYKD Fancy that! @surya_14kumar, literally sprinting out to bat for the first time for India.

The protocol in the UAE was very strict, everyone bought into it and it was very well executed. I am hoping it will be as rigorous this time too. One of the strengths of the #IPL is that it keeps adapting to the situations it has to face. South Africa-2009 made it stronger, UAE-2020 delivered one of the best tournaments. The cluster-caravan format is another first and hopefully that will work too. So, a completely new format for the #IPL2021. No team plays at home which is fair given that only 5 teams have matches at their grounds. And no crowds early on.

Such composure for someone so young and inexperienced. Already, in such a short career, he has walked into difficult situations and handled them like a veteran. I particularly enjoyed the first 50. Well crafted, played with responsibility, aware India needed to catch up with England. It showed his growth as a batsman. What joy to see young @RishabhPant17 bat. I did not think I would see a reverse sweep to Anderson with the new ball when a century was there for the taking. He will keep us on the edge of our seats and will be great for our game. England are trying hard but are a bowler short. Bess hasn't been test class and Stokes is absolutely spent. The debate on whether or not the law is good is for another time. The umpires have to interpret the law as it stands. And given the allowed margin of error in ball-tracking, more than half the ball has to hit the bottom of the bails for a decision to be overturned @vaitheek @kartikmurali You are indeed right. We were talking about spinners. Cheers For a decision to be overturned, more than 50% of the ball has to hit the top of the stump. In Pant's case, a major part of the ball was hitting the bails but not enough was hitting the top of the stump. Watching @benstokes38 this morning was to realise, once again, what a special cricketer he is In Mohd Siraj, India have found a whole-hearted trier. He's nippy, has the outswinger, the ball that nips back in, a good bouncer and a wonderful attitude.

Outstanding from Axar Patel. Used the conditions perfectly. And the moment he got one to turn early, his quicker, skiddier ball was going to be the danger. A very unhappy sojourn for Ollie Pope. Looked very lost. Mighty impressive innings from Zak Crawley. Driving has been top class. Clearly the teams have read this surface and the conditions differently.

Guess the century tilted it Ashwin's way India's biggest plus in the 2nd innings has been the keeping of Rishabh Pant Was always going to be a matter of time.

And watch out for Axar Patel who will be a handful. So a bowler who has bowled 33 overs has to come out to protect a batsman.... Wonderful from Ashwin. I was beginning to fear that the batsman in him was getting lost. On a difficult track, this century is a gem. The bowlers are tiring now but India's lead bowler has batted so long, he might be tired too!! The batsman in Ashwin is emerging again. This has been such a clever, inventive innings. \"zero boundary balls\". That is where England will think they have been poorly served. https://t.co/UvgUp3IWz5 Virat Kohli has 27 test centuries but I have little doubt he will value this half century higher than many of those.

He is currently giving himself a few more runs to bowl at though he probably knows he has enough. https://t.co/28ZGy1ipbH Ashwin's approach is interesting. Even with Kohli at the other end, and with a pretty good defence to fall back on, he thinks taking a chance is mandatory and that defence isn't much good. Got to be careful here.... Can't assume that another 80-90 will come anyway. The Leach-Foakes combination has been outstanding.

It is a very effective shot on relatively truer wickets but can be fraught with danger here. No extras in that score of 329. This is a good score but India's tail has to be equipped better to hang in. With Rishabh being in the form he is in, India sold themselves at least 20-30 short So many memories of those studios in Singapore. In Lorong Chuan. Good times John, remember them fondly. https://t.co/hN4IcDxODp There will be a lot of discussion about the pitch. But do keep in mind that a team made 300 at 3.41/over on it. Excellent day for India. Rohit was looking like he was playing on a different pitch. It could be the defining innings of the match. Rahane said India needs another 50-60. I suspect anything over 325 is fine. The appeal for a catch against Rahane, before he got out, was quite poorly handled. Should have checked snicko on the way up.  By allowing England to retain the review, have they admitted they were wrong? Outstanding innings from Rohit. Made the track look a lot easier than I suspect it is. Such a special player. Rohit Sharma was just born to bat. His batting today is an illustration. @world_citizen4 Thank you @Vb29happy haha, you remember! India were looking dominant till about 11am. This is already a tricky wicket to bat on which makes Rohit's innings all the more remarkable. I think 300-325 will be a really good score. No more than one wicket in this session from India's perspective. First thoughts. Ball seems to be stopping just a bit (noticed the puff of dust?) And Olly Stone is very impressive. This is the spin combination India would have gone in with in the first test if Axar Patel had been fit. Siraj is a fine exponent of reverse swing so could be effective and to that extent, the absence of Bumrah might not be as big on this surface. England are trying to create a set-up where they can have 7-8 batsmen, 2-3 keepers, 6-7 pacers all of whom are capable of being in the test XI and who can be moved around without affecting the playing combination too much. It has happened in white ball cricket, but not in tests Big toss to win if the pitch report is indeed accurate. Good to see Kuldeep back in and I suspected Bumrah might be rested. 7 changes across the teams.....

England's positives though outweigh India's. Not just Root but stellar performances from Stokes and Anderson and quality support acts from Sibley, Leach and Bess. Thought Buttler was very good behind the stumps too. Can't believe he goes away. India had a few positives. The 2nd innings from Kohli, the form of Ashwin with the ball and Gill who bats like he is breezing through a simple maths test. Pujara and Pant and the composure of Washington. Need a bit more from the 2nd spinner but nothing to panic yet. Had the players to take advantage of every situation. Deserving winners. https://t.co/tJfNzuAMm6 Well played England.

You still need to bat time and score enough to take advantage of that and England won the game with the partnerships Root had with Sibley and Stokes. When it seems it is all over there is still something to play for.

And I still don't see why the dismissal is controversial given that it prevents batsmen from running less! https://t.co/HE0wyWnc1a India clearly start favourites. There are two things though they need to be careful about. One, the glow of a great win can linger a little too long (and that is understandable). Two, the discussion around captaincy cannot filter into the team. This is now Kohli's team again. Very nice as always from @shreyaghoshal. Listened to it twice already\n\nhttps://t.co/VvEA1DT9XF @vikkipie_tuteja @dindaashoke There was none. Big shout out to @dindaashoke on a fine career.

Maybe.... @sthalekar93 @joybhattacharj @gauravkapur @Ajith_tweets @cricbuzz And that is why we love having you there It is only my thought (it depends on the answer to whether the players wanted to be rested) but if it is indeed true in one of the few remaining homes of test cricket, it is a very strong indicator of the future. Bairstow and Buttler are key players of England's white ball squad and they will also be available for the IPL that follows. It tells me that England have, subtly, prioritised winning the T20 World Cup over the WTC. I am keen to know if the players rested either wanted to, or needed to, be rested. If they wanted to play, you end up making them insecure; a state of mind which isn't good for anybody. (Thread) Like most, I am perplexed by England's decision to rest players who would make their best XI from a series that is vital to their chances at the WTC. In a sense, being key proponents of the WTC, they have diminished its importance.

But they will have to compete for places @bhuvster Never said that. Do read carefully @VivekGuptaviews @ShekharGupta I knew @Tanmoycv01 I know. As you can see, I am baffled too by some of the selections.. https://t.co/RUpmzi7NMH India's team is going to be very difficult to pick. The core issue is whether Saha keeps and you play 4 bowlers or whether Pant keeps and you play 5. With option 1, it is actually possible that none of those that bowled so gallantly at Brisbane get a game. That will be something! I think England's best starting eleven would be Burns, Crawley, Root, Pope, Stokes, Buttler, Moeen, Curran, Archer, Leach, Broad/Anderson. If Root is adamant about batting at 4, Bairstow at 3 and him at 4. On the sub-continent, it doesn't matter if you are 3 or 4. This is an incredible generation and on the biggest stage, they showed that they belonged.

Throw me some names. I am happy to learn. I am sure there are fine players but an overseas player in the world's biggest league is a huge investment. So do tell me who... @Gillian_Price I am waiting Gillian. Throw me some names that match your outrage. They have to possess a skill, like with Chris Morris, that we can't find in India. I await a list of 10 @iYusufVaid An IPL overseas player has to provide something that a local player cannot. The South Africans currently in the IPL do that and are respected. But I do not see another outside this pool currently able to do that. Maybe in a few years. I look forward to it Thanks. A loud mooooo to you! Cheers. https://t.co/N1PrXgtdzg For all cricket lovers in South Africa who are showing varying shades of anger, happy to get a list of top talents from the Ngidi and Nortje era (not established players like Rabada and de Kock). A strong South Africa is good for world cricket and I would be happy to know more. https://t.co/74WZ5TMioO @LawrenceBailey0 Go on, happy to hear names. I am looking at players who are ready for leagues like the Big Bash and the IPL. Overseas players, because of the responsibility they carry in franchise teams, need to be ready. So, as I said, happy to hear names @Gillian_Price Rabada, Nortje and de Kock, and to some extent Ngidi, are all excellent additions to the IPL. But I don't see another set getting people as excited.

It is a bad day for West Indies supporters with releases for Cottrell, Thomas, Allen, Rutherford and Keemo Paul. Suspect someone will buy back Paul. Big release list at @RCBTweets.

The weather is on everyone's mind and yet you cannot let that influence decision making too much because it can be fickle. Best thing for this test is if Australia are bowled out for 250 and India are set a tricky 280...

Without them, the gap between fc and international cricket would have been very tough to bridge. Quiet thanks to Rahul Dravid too for the finishing school he has been. Australia marginally ahead. I thought a bowling attack with 11 career test wickets did remarkably well to stick to its task. Good call! https://t.co/Ld2Q97nUqd It looked like Australia were taking the game away. The conditions and the situation were right for them. But as always, India have been admirably persistent. It is a quality that has defined them in this series. Two set batsmen, oldish ball, bowler short, it is set up for Australia. Bowlers need to be really disciplined and intense Labuschagne should buy a lottery ticket..... Can't believe another Indian bowler has gone down ... While we laud the resilience, is it time to start thinking why so many are going down with muscle related issues? Isn't it fantastic that places like Karnal, Chinnappampatti and Palghar are providing cricketers to the Indian team? Such beautiful stories.... That is some start. Lovely length from Siraj, lovely catch by Rohit. As I mentioned at the start, that line is credited to @GregBaum. https://t.co/kwU5UHt3v6 Just wonder if India could have played Kuldeep Yadav for one of the quicks..... I will be very interested in seeing whether India approach this match asking why life has thrown them into this predicament. Or whether they are buoyed by the opportunity and that they have nothing to lose. So, no Ishant, no Bumrah, no Shami, no Yadav, no Ashwin, no Jadeja. Siraj with 2 tests behind him is the most experienced Indian bowler. Total experience Siraj (2), Saini (1), Shardul (11 balls). This is surreal and unprecedented Looks like there are debuts for @Natarajan_91 and @Sundarwashi5. Life throws opportunities when you least expect them. These two were retained as net bowlers originally! Wish them well. @hemantbuch Cool. Thanks @GregBaum \"Everything to play for but not much to play with\" Excellent. A day's play is 6 hours and teams have to get their overs in. The allowance of half an hour is now assumed to be part of the playing hours! In Galle, spin has bowled 62 overs and they are struggling to bowl 90 overs in spite of the extra time! Good to see other young players doing well too in the #SyedMushtaqAliTrophy2021. Devdutt Padikkal got 99* and Abhishek Sharma, another player with something about him, gets a century as opener. In a 125 run chase J&amp;K finally elevate Abdul Samad and he smacks 54 (35). He is going to be a fine player. Did your choice match mine? @IDFCFIRSTBank https://t.co/gArqfAg0be Aaplya saglyanna god bolaychi khup garaj aahe hya kaalat. Baraach tilgul khaooya!

But that compromise, if either wasn't as good as a batsman at no 6, would require a pretty good no 7 &amp; no 8. This makes it another reason to watch the game @captainshanky So essentially we are telling Pant that he isn't much good against spin standing up and he isn't much good with a pink ball moving around? This is a big statement of confidence in some players and on the approach to playing a test series. I will be very keen to see consistency because that also signifies conviction and creates confidence in players. If Shaw had to be out and Gill in, the like for like replacement for Kohli (if possible at all!) was Rahul. But in principle, India have decided they want 5 bowlers. It is a big punt on the batting skills of Pant and Jadeja. I hope it isn't the outcome of needing to play Jadeja We now have two confused keepers because they have been given conflicting signals. Pant was, effectively, told he was the overseas keeper and Saha the home keeper. That changed at Adelaide and now suddenly, it has changed again. The principle always dictates the selection (cont) The absence of Shami and Ishant means they feel the need for a 5th bowler which is either an admission that they don't trust 4 or that they expect the track to turn later. Since Jadeja cannot play at 6 in Australia, it means sacrificing the keeper for someone who can bat (cont) Thread. India's team for the 2nd test is an admission that they got many things wrong in the first test. Especially with the keeper &amp; opener. They must think Shaw is short on confidence because dropping a player after 2 innings means you aren't giving him time to learn (cont) Merry Christmas to all. May it lead to kinder, happier tomorrows. @bhaleraosarang @cricketaakash Try explaining that to people!!

These are marginal decisions where the team management chooses to show faith in a player. I see Gill playing in the middle order soon unless the opener's slot opens up Like the fact that India has announced the playing eleven up front. Shows clarity of thought. Like the spinner being picked, his will be a holding role. Have gone with the better keeper and have shown faith in the top six batsmen to get the runs.

I have no issue with a switch hit if you allow a bowler to go over or around the wicket or bowl left or right handed without needing to tell the batsman. Just as the switch hit is a great skill, so is bowling off either hand. Around all the discussion, don't lose sight of the fact that India played better. Whatever the discussion around his presence, once on @yuzi_chahal has delivered a game changing performance. Excellent spell from @Sundarwashi5. He does it so often. @cricadharsh Fine on that count Yes, I mentioned delayed concussion on air. We saw that with Liton Das in Kolkata. There, the physio came out, the protocol was implemented but the symptoms appeared an over or two later https://t.co/k4oWjbhsU5 The only thing we need to be careful about before passing judgement on the concussion substitute episode was whether there was delayed concussion; whether he showed symptoms after going back to the dressing room.

That he has reached here is beautiful. Always good to see the bright side The biggest plus for India though was seeing how @hardikpandya7 adapted to the role of a pure batsman.

Back in my hotel room and contemplating the magnitude of what a young man from Chinnappampatti achieved today. @Natarajan_91's debut shows us that Indian cricket is a meritocracy. And may it always be that way. @bomanirani Happy 60th to one of my favourite people! Boman, you will be the youngest 60 year old I know! @anandvasu Exactly my point. Illegal for a bowler, legal for a batsman! @atulkasbekar You will be surprised! There are already 3-4 bowlers who can bowl with both hands. @shayupilal If it was, everyone would be doing it right! India need to take care of the little things. Catches, direct hits.... Shubman Gill was looking really good. He will learn from Virat Kohli how to convert that into a big score. I would love one day to see a right handed bowler running in and suddenly bowling left handed without informing the umpire or the batsman. And watch the outrage that follows! So many changes! Got to feel for Chahal and Mayank. What a day for Natarajan. What a story. If you are 29, don't lose hope. Wish him well. @captainshanky It goes against the very ethic of our sport. Because it is dangerous or risky doesn't make it right. You have to respect the guidelines within which the ball is delivered and then use your skill to counter it. @captainshanky Never know what kind of bowler turns up! The question is: will a bowler be allowed to do it. Whether be can or can't is a separate issue. And batsmen play late and they charge, play off front foot and back, loft the ball or sweep it. The trickery and skill must lie within a legal challenge and its acceptance. https://t.co/z6duRD5rND The contest in our game is simple. The bowler's challenge is the ball he bowls &amp; the field he sets. The batsman's response: counter that with his bat while respecting the challenge that is thrown at him. Within this, a player is free to innovate. Anything outside this is unfair The reverse sweep is fine because a batsman doesn't change his grip. He is still a right hander and that is a valid skill. But a switch hit makes the field setting useless because you are bowling to a different kind of batsman. The umpire says \"right arm over\". After that, the bowler is free to bowl anything as long as he isn't chucking and is right arm over. The batsman takes guard as a right hander &amp; he is free to play any shot as long as he is right handed. For the switch hit, he becomes left handed https://t.co/DzmlAN4umT I agree completely with Ian Chappell. I have long said that the switch hit is unfair because the bowler sets the field for a right handed batsman who cannot then become a left hander. A right arm bowler should then be allowed to run in and bowl left handed too. @NMWoolrich @VenkyMysore Haha. True.

They don't keep their word and don't respond to polite queries. Then the battery will be sent from somewhere to somewhere by pigeon mail and the pigeon will be untraceable, they will get the standard, meaningless \"sorry\" emails, promises of prompt action and \"escalating\" the issue.

Back 10 critical and that means they need wickets now. Wish @imVkohli a big year and lots of runs. The more you score, the more joy you give. And of course this year, the joy will be little!

You have forced your way in. And you didn't depend on anyone else. The other three will be wary of you The last week began with so many possibilities, with every match being crucial to play-off aspirations. And every match has been one-sided! The same team has dominated and been crushed! The tail-end of the #IPL is a different beast. What an extraordinary turnaround there has been for @SunRisers since Saha arrived. It has unleashed @davidwarner31 &amp; made him,once again, the feared batsman who bosses the #IPL every year. The identical twin who was pottering around earlier has been revealed. The original is back Good to see that @SunRisers are not pottering around and playing safe given it is not a huge target. They have to stay ahead of the asking rate as far as possible. These can be tricky chases No praise too high for Zimbabwe to beat a team like Pakistan playing at home over 50 overs. Players like Taylor, Williams, Reza, Muzarabani just keep producing these performances. Keen to see more of Hasnain now. We are seeing from @Wriddhipops why a keeper is a spinner's best friend So we  don't know too much more than we did! https://t.co/WdQWtke3FV Rohit Sharma at the toss! Yes there is a qualification at stake but this is huge news. All eyes on him and his fitness You were very good for Australia @ShaneRWatson33 but you were especially good for the @IPL. Those early years, the MVPs, the 2018 &amp; 2019 finals.There is a small group of overseas stars who enriched the #IPL &amp; you will always be in the list. Go well, hopefully our paths will cross In all fairness @RCBTweets and @DelhiCapitals deserved to make the play-offs. But isn't it amazing that the bottom placed team had to overturn just one result to be in contention! Awesome tournament. Fair to say that both #RCB and #DC are going through now. #KKR to await the outcome of #MIvsSRH #DelhiCapitals happier of the two sides on the field. #KKR, watching no doubt, the unhappiest! They don't want a close game. Remember, a close game means both #DC and #RCB go through Loved the speeds that Ashwin bowled at. If there is no dew, none so far, that might be the way to go for RCB who have three spinners today RCB need a powerful striker below Virat and AB. Will free those two. That was the role for Shivam Dube and Morris. So Ashwin won't come back on the field. India's strained hamstring tally is growing. Hopefully it is a precaution.

Nani\u2026 The leggies have been so good in this tournament. Chahal and Rashid top of the league with Chakravarthy the revelation. And I particularly liked Rahul Chahar and Murugan Ashwin. Imran Tahir and Ravi Bishnoi had their moments as did Rahul Tewatia and Shreyas Gopal. Who's next? If #MI beat #SRH then of course MI, DC, RCB and KKR go through Makes #RCBvsDC so interesting now. A margin of greater than about 20 runs might see #KKR go through at the expense of the loser. So two targets to play for tomorrow Sensational from @KKRiders. Have given themselves a real chance of qualifying. Didn't think they could at 100-5 after 13. Morgan and Cummins and that catch from Karthik! But it was as much the pressure of the chase that got to RR. What an extraordinary cricket match. The occasion can affect the very best. And what a brilliant, topsy-turvy #IPL this has been #DC and #RCB fans watching more closely now than #RR fans Even if RR go past 111, KKR could still benefit from a drop in NRR for the team that loses tomorrow (DC vs RCB). Must keep the margin of victory as big as possible. What a start! What a catch! Could well be the moment of the match! Remember, in trying to get the runs quickly, they might hand KKR the NRR difference they need In their last two games, @rajasthanroyals have chased 185 and 195. Now another big one but this time there is the added incentive, or pressure, of staying alive for the play-offs. Enjoyed talking to MSD about the #CSK campaign. He doesn't shy away from telling it as it is. Ruturaj Gaikwad looks a very mature player. Delighted he got a second chance and how well he has taken it. Excellent from Hooda. Showing his value when the time comes. Keeping his team alive @sridhar_0707 @lionsdenkxip If..... Good start for @lionsdenkxip. If they win, they will almost certainly be in the play-off and will be a dangerous side to come up against. Lots to play for. So, MSD has told all the @ChennaiIPL fans that he isn't going anywhere just yet! @Marcus60s70s80s @Joy_Cricket @krishnajaga @suubsy @V_Anawalikar @DisisDrSid @Florilegium_FD @alawyerwrites The world gets younger and younger!! That was 16 years after my first international game.... Brilliant from Jason Holder. So  #MI will definitely finish at No 1, either #DC or #RCB will go through with 16 and two teams will qualify with 14 points. Wide open. What a climax to the #Dream11IPL. Afraid #RCB will have to bowl out of their skins to defend this. The top teams on the table are being asked some searching questions! @krishnajaga @V_Anawalikar @Marcus60s70s80s @suubsy @DisisDrSid @Florilegium_FD @alawyerwrites Maybe I will put up extracts on a website some day.

Interesting that he talked about meditation to get over the hot-headed image he had acquired. Whatever the reason, he is playing the best cricket of his life. Like so many good Indian opening batsmen, young Padikkal is an excellent player of spin. @navkrish55 @Srujanhp18 I hope it was correct. \ud83d\ude1f Just the kind of Power Play #RCB were waiting for.

He had to get past Shreyas Iyer or Manish Pandey given that Mayank Agarwal opens and Rahul and Samson are the keepers. Must be so hard for @mandeeps12. But how well he batted! He can be so proud of this innings. The distant car in the rear-view mirror @lionsdenkxip is overtaking a few on the highway now! Team to watch out for. He walks the talk! Calls himself #UniverseBoss, plays like one! @lionsdenkxip have won every match since he started playing! Bumrah and Shami have a lot of work ahead of them.... Sydney has decent sized boundaries and Canberra is a huge field. That, and the mystery factor, would make Chakravarthy a tactical selection https://t.co/oLffYRiKk9 Clearly KL Rahul is now the no 1 keeper/batsman in white ball cricket. And, for now Pant is being seen as a test match keeper who can shore up the batting. I suspect too that Gill is in the test team as a middle order player. The keg spinners have been outstanding for @lionsdenkxip. But @KKRiders have been all or nothing in this innings. 1st 2 overs 10-3, next 6 overs 70-0, next 8 overs 34-4, I guess the fact that Rohit Sharma may not be fit enough to even play the tests in mid December would suggest he won't be part of the IPL anymore. His fitness is being monitored but with quarantine and travel restrictions, it seems unlikely. What a pity! I am sitting in my room and I am clapping loudly for Varun Chakravarthy and Mohd Siraj.

Still think Morgan has to bat at 4 and ensure there is no fire instead of having to fight it. https://t.co/qOxRRpwxhK It is 40-3 and the captain, the best batsman on the team at the moment, is still sitting in the dugout. #KKR.

But it is obvious, isn't it! https://t.co/zf02A8OVPH The all-round performance of Vijay Shankar is the biggest plus. He had to be batting no 4 as an India player @SunRisers This innings from Manish Pandey is what you want your senior batsman to do. Take control of the innings and see the team through! The gulf is there to see. In the power play, Archer is 2-0-5-2. The rest 4-0-53-0 If this wasn't T20 cricket where spells are short, I would have said \"stop what you are doing and come and watch Jofra Archer bowl\" ! This is astonishing skill and pace. What a start! Archer's first ball to Warner is at 151 kmph! And when the catch does come, it is at 2nd slip! How often do you see a 2nd slip to a great opener! A muddle in the middle is having a domino effect on @rajasthanroyals. Were looking like that they might have got to 175.

The @lionsdenkxip are the car in everyone's rear view mirror now. And it is gathering speed. They won without a scare today which is a massive development. Delighted that Shikhar Dhawan was man of the match. Sometimes we place too much emphasis on having a player from the winning team. Perfect choice His definition of a single is a bit unique though. https://t.co/XWFRsrqj3m When @nicholas_47 adds consistency to his skill, and he is going to very soon, he is going to light up stadiums around the world. This @lionsdenkxip line-up has a stream of outstanding strikers. They just don't seem to fire together. When they do, it will be some sight. @atulkasbekar And did you feel lighter and happier? One of the reasons you always stay with Shikhar Dhawan, especially in white ball cricket, is that when he gets on a roll, he is unstoppable. And a genuine match winner. RT @CricketersFound: To this year's IPL leading run scrorer and the man with an orange cap, we wish the BEST and our heartfelt gratitude. T\u2026 Top quality half century from Shikhar Dhawan.

That was my first series as a presenter @RANGANAT290 @lionsdenkxip @JimmyNeesh It isn't about proving people right or wrong, it is about roles for good players. If he bats at 7, it means you are budgeting for a brittle top order which isn't the case. Can understand if he is going to bat up, which is where he is so good. Enjoyed it. What an evening that was!

How on earth do they find themselves at the bottom of the table! Somebody is always there at the end for @mipaltan. It is a monster batting side. Today, Pollard and Coulter Nile with 57(21). But they have a.daunting top 5 to contend with at @lionsdenkxip @MTapree What is the connection? Great game of cricket. Got to love sport. Like they would a diamond, @KKRiders kept #LockieFerguson in a safe and only displayed him on the big day! Keep saying it is a game of inches on a ground of acres! The Ferguson save, the catch off the free hit.... Both could have tilted the balance. Excellent start coming apart at the seams for @SunRisers.

Yes, you need 16 but they will get those. I reckon @RCBTweets are pretty much through too. Tomorrow's winner between @KKRiders and @SunRisers will get a toe in the door. When he plays like that Shikhar Dhawan is amongst the most pleasing batsmen on the eye. That is two innings now that he has cranked up his strike rate. Excellent innings. Brilliant finish. Just what you want from a no 7. Axar Patel has been a quiet hit for @DelhiCapitals with ball and these rapid bursts with the bat. There is an aura around @ABdeVilliers17 and I suspect the bowlers are fearful rather than optimistic when he is on fire https://t.co/mlWmm7ZlkM Genius. Just say it every day. @ABdeVilliers17 The great man is at it and he is targeting the biggest boundary @ABdeVilliers17 While he may not be as dramatic as the other two, and only has 4 overs to show what he can do, I think we should acknowledge @yuzi_chahal as the third leg of the @RCBTweets triangle with @ABdeVilliers17 and @imVkohli So now Buttler goes down the order! There is a new pair everyday. Maybe they want to use Buttler in the role he plays in odi cricket; as a powerful finisher. Can't help thinking Buttler and Stokes can swap positions.... Arthur C Clarke called it \"the greatest communications experiment in history\" &amp; it truly was. Learn how our space scientists launched a massive one-of-a-kind project that changed the India we live in, on this episode of Mission ISRO on @spotifyindia https://t.co/AQVDhbOeC4 They are looking unassailable at this stage, are @mipaltan. You can't find a weak link there. Over the years, @mipaltan have made some excellent overseas purchases. The trade last year of Quinton de Kock is one of the better ones. Amidst the stars around him Rahul Chahar has slipped in some important overs for @mipaltan. Excellent today in the middle overs. So like for like changes then....at last Coulter-Nile gets a game for Pattinson, Green plays a similar role to Narine as does Mavi to Nagarkoti. The temperatures have come off and there is no significant advantage here for batting first.

But the pandemic has raised the number of daily requests by 200%, so we need many more people to join in. Please spread the word and do donate A walk in the park at the end becomes an obstacle course for @lionsdenkxip Chris Gayle has been the greatest T20 player. No doubt about that. The question was whether he still is. I don't know that but he is still value. So Gayle doesn't bat at his no either. But this is easier to explain. The only thing that @lionsdenkxip were doing well was the opening partnership so why break your strength. It requires Gayle to adjust at no 3 where Pooran is actually doing rather well.....Tricky issues. If it was the match-up of AB vs leg spin that caused him to come down at no 6, then Murugan Ashwin and Ravi Bishnoi must strut around for the rest of their cricket career, tell their relatives we were the reason the great AB didn't come out to bat! @sambitbal And then you have to figure out why Dube is batting above AB... @nitinmehlawat1 So you don't send the best white ball player till the googlies are gone? There must be a thought behind this batting order....maybe left handers to tackle leg spin.....but a set AB in the back 10 is a fearsome thought! I am foxed.....As I said there must be another reason.... If ever a team was picked to chase down a big score, it is this @lionsdenkxip team. Gayle, Rahul, Mayank, Pooran, Maxwell, Hooda! But this rejuvenated @RCBTweets side might just put too many on the board. Two excellent batting sides on display. Wonderful. The message is simple but it goes so much further. Washing hands this #GlobalHandwashingDay takes on a new meaning. @MFPA_India amazing talent @SavlonIndia #SavlonSwasthIndia hats off for presenting this unique perspective. #NoHandUnwashed. https://t.co/O6ANi1dbtd I could see he lived well and lived full.

Been a privilege to know the family and be friends with Rita and Gautam. @TomMoodyCricket Fair point. Been fun to watch such extraordinary fast bowlers. So good to see yorkers back in the tournament. During the first few games, I wondered if they had been stuck in customs. A yorker is always a great ball. This is the kind of win that will give the @DelhiCapitals great satisfaction. Of course the quicks lorded it but Ashwin was brilliant and Axar provided tbe turning point. This is some bowling combination. And watch out for Tushar Deshpande. Impressive. So enjoyed watching the fast bowlers back to being the feared predators of the jungle and not the defanged ones we see in zoos. Archer and Rabada and Nortje were brilliant. Get rid of flat decks and tiny boundaries and the bat will be a shield, not a weapon. Outstanding defence by @DelhiCapitals.  Used quality spin, extreme pace and a very impressive young pacer.

Didn't lose wickets but didn't allow them to lock up the game either. 0-59 (8) was perfect. What a difference one move makes! Curran provides the start, everyone else can play at their pace, get wickets in hand and a comfortable score to bowl at. Curran broke the lethargy.

Complete performance. Many layers, many performers, excellent balance, tactics perfect and a genius in full flow. #RCB have read the conditions perfectly and their spinners, outstanding throughout the tournament, are on fire. I will repeat, this is the best balanced RCB team for a long time Isn't it nice that two young men who played the U19 World Cup two years ago are opening the batting in such a big game! @RealShubmanGill @TBanton18 Genius. Find me another word for @ABdeVilliers17. This one will do for now! Genius. This Sharjah track has, like a model on the ramp, come out in different clothes.....Serious recalibration of scores happening.... Just 21 in the last 4 overs. #RCB will start making a move soon.... I would have thought that #KKR would have been told which deliveries by Sunil Narine were deemed to be a problem. They might have been able to play him without him bowling those problem deliveries. Really like this @RCBTweets side. They have backed their batsmen and have gone the opposite way that #KKR have; with an extra bowler. This is among the best balanced #RCB sides they have put out. In fact, once they go to Dubai or Abu Dhabi can play someone like Negi for a quick Will be very interested in seeing how #KKR manage their bowling resources.

Bumrah might just want to give his address to the delivery boy!! https://t.co/Vjsee7PrDO @GullyXperts_V @mipaltan Nice! Powerful. That is what @mipaltan were today. And two great catches to top it! Wow, now that is a new ball attack! Delighted to see Bumrah charge in with the new ball. Most days 193 is enough. If @rajasthanroyals get these, we have a very watchable time ahead So @mipaltan get the finish they wanted. And another player @surya_14kumar demands attention. Always wondered why @ShreyasGopal19 is talked about as little as he is. Excellent today. 2-28 from 4. Not bad if you are 19, playing in the #Dream11IPL and you get a top international player out in your 1st over. #KartikTyagi What a day for the forgotten men of T20 cricket! The finger spinners! Between Washington Sunder, Axar Patel and Ashwin, they bowled 12 overs and got 3-64! Not to be. And this big defeat will not just be demoralising, it will cause their NRR to plummet. https://t.co/Wyefow5kus Why don't they just send the purple cap to Rabada's house along with his visa? Tough target to chase. If #RCB get these, their confidence will just skyrocket. Big chase in the context of their campaign this year. Featuring @Natarajan_91, @navdeepsaini96, @ishankishan51, @Sundarwashi5, @rashidkhan_19, @rahultewatia02  and @klrahul11. Agree?

I just wonder if KL Rahul is trying too hard to bat like he is the leader; like he needs to bat through. He can do 132(69) when in flow. But outside of that he has averaged 42, which is great, but at a SR of 118. He just needs to bat a little more freely, maybe. It isn't too late for @lionsdenkxip but I am not sure they are closer to knowing their best eleven. They certainly have the players to bounce back Jai and Veeru all over again..... #CSK The engines have warmed up. #CSK are back on the highway..... @Sdoull @joybhattacharj @mmbangwa @7polly7 Whoever you pick, there will be someone you will seem to have missed. It is your team! And it is a good one. Right @ChennaiIPL now that is a power play.... @narayan140 @aparanjape @paritoshZero @jakesprime Times change. There is a flow, a pattern to T20 as well. Requires different skills. Hit the refresh button and watch it.... 178 is a very good score in Dubai. Very keen to see the #CSK approach. Can't be 50-55 from 10 overs again. Good to see a bright start from Watson More like that. Three class shots https://t.co/6ggLcSNowD KL Rahul playing accumulator again. There is enough batting depth for him to do what he is best at: be the destroyer. Hoping KL Rahul plays with the freedom that defines him. Got the feeling he has held himself back a bit in the last couple of games. Like the changes that @lionsdenkxip have made. They needed Mandeep to get a game but also needed a proper third seamer in Jordan. But they need to stay settled from now on. We have just seen @mipaltan show off their depth. Every player is pulling his weight in the team and they will be particularly happy with the runs from Quinton de Kock and the overs they got out of Kieron Pollard. Pattinson and Nortje have been such outstanding replacement decisions. First saw Pattinson as a young man in Australia and was impressed by his unrelenting pace and aggression. Many injuries later, he still has the same approach. Excellent pick. Been a while since I saw Hardik Pandya put down a sitter. Could be a huge factor I still think Mumbai Indians use Pollard too conservatively. One of the most feared batsmen on one of the most dreaded pitches for bowlers only faces 13 balls! Krunal Pandya's heroics keep @mipaltan in the game. But @sunrisers need a powerful start given the inexperience down the order Watch this. This is how the #IPL changes lives.
