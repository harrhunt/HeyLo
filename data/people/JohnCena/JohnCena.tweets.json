{"tweets": "The most absurd obstacle course in the world awaits! \ud83d\udd34\u00a0\n@Wipeout is back and premiering April 1 at 9/8c on @TBSNetwork! https://t.co/UxoA7OVuu9 I\u2019ve known @RandyOrton for nearly two decades and have been vocal about his in-ring ability and natural talent. This was a great interview and an honest look at the man I know, hosted by @steveaustinBSR who has seen it all &amp; done it all in @WWE. GREAT interview. @peacockTV https://t.co/rpQwthP9Ul Self love takes bravery to be ok with the world seeing you for you. Find that courage, the stress lifted might indeed outweigh any embarrassment or criticism. If you are pursuing a goal and you are not even the slightest bit better than you were yesterday, ask why. The answer will either put you back on track, or change the goal. Forgive only after you have come to terms with hardship and found the lesson it yields. Work to be open minded with new ideas and cultures. The lazy way is to be stand-offish. Avoid that urge and you might surprise yourself with the result. Any and every achievement comes with sacrifice. Do not blindly think that when you decide to pursue a goal, your current life balance will stay intact. Adapt. Overcome. Achieve. The big balls are back. Catch the season premiere of #Wipeout Thursday, April 1 on @TBSNetwork! https://t.co/sRzx2qDBcz Live a life, not an apology. Reflection is quite valuable and if you can\u2019t quite reflect on some moments because you aren\u2019t ready, seek help, ask questions why and begin laying the foundation to get what could be valuable answers to your past, your now, and your future. Be a reason for others to feel good about humankind. If you are hesitant in helping others because you feel they may \u201cpass\u201d you, they already have. If it is what\u2019s inside that counts, don\u2019t shy away from facing, and loving who you are. If you choose to engage in conversation. Engage. Listen to what people have to say rather than thinking of what you\u2019ll say next. Having a guide on the drive thru life can help, having a chauffeur might not. Believe in yourself enough to help others both less fortunate and more gifted then yourself. A failed relationship is an opportunity to find out who you are. A successful relationship is an opportunity to be who you are. BE A WORK IN PROGRESS and DO YOUR BEST EVERY DAY are two projects years in the making and I\u2019m beyond excited to share it with you all! So I hope you\u2019ll join me for a virtual signing on 4/7. Tickets and info here: https://t.co/mUMIgRp53x https://t.co/RJHBdypjEz If you are doing something you don\u2019t want to do, do your best to make it a vehicle to get you where you want to go. Perseverance is many times the deciding factor in growth. Stick with it. Honestly evaluate. Be and love yourself. Grow and evolve. RT @TheFastSaga: The family returns June 25. Only in theaters. #F9 https://t.co/D9klpcvHDk Knowing and testing limits is a great way to find and eclipse them. Ignoring limits is a great way to injure the body, mind, and spirit. Invest in what you invest in. Give people enough freedom to be themselves even if their actions are hurtful. Do they apologize? Repeatedly make the same mistake? Say one thing do another? Take advantage of vulnerability? Have zero empathy? It says lots about who they really are. Often our discovery of art and creativity is serendipitous, be brave enough to embrace unplanned inspiration. Change is tough. Many times we are afraid of change. Do not expect people to commit to you, if you have not allowed yourself to commit to them. It is dishonest and unfair. Let them have their moment. Time wasted on them is just that, wasted time. Focus on you and your growth. If you ignore the chance to absorb the wisdom of life, you succumb to its consequences. The more ambitious the goal, the more work it takes to reach. If your journey awards you a moment where you experience the feeling of being #1, that does not entitle you to treat others like #2. Be accountable for yourself and your actions thru the lows and the highs. An honest relationship is just that, honest. If it\u2019s not, then, it\u2019s not. Empathy is a precious attribute. It has tremendous value, takes effort to cultivate, and becomes more and more rare each day. Even the smallest doses of it can yield life changing results. There is no schedule for inspiration. Whenever inspired, embrace it. Don\u2019t let the burden of wanting to be remembered outweigh the importance of remembering to live. Incredibly grateful to work with such talented folks under the direction of our writer/director @JamesGunn on @DCPeacemaker. Working with this team (and these questionable lawn ornaments) makes every day on set fun ... cannot wait for you all to see! @HBOMax https://t.co/Tx2LRMrenv America, you did it!

Now, check out the full breakdown at https://t.co/F8EJOkbl3M to see which bottles you didn\u2019t count. #ad https://t.co/PqWXd8Urbw Stop making failure a bad word. Revenge is a tough way to live. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy once I make this person miserable, or see them fail\u201d. You may experience a moment of satisfaction, but will do little to address why you feel those things and you\u2019re true joy. Having mixed feelings about Valentine\u2019s Day is understandable, but never shut love out of your life. We all have ups and downs, be brave enough to let love in. Everyday. Some days we are rewarded with the victory, Some days we are rewarded with the struggle. Each day we are rewarded with the gift. Act accordingly. Simplify complexity.

It\u2019s ok to strive towards success and security, but what you DO will define you, not what you have. Whether it\u2019s a difficult topic or not, the is no better approach than honesty. It is a gateway to the quickest and most appropriate resolve. When approached with opportunity, should you accept, give it your all or decline it. Work to be less selfish and more self aware. It was great to welcome you into Peacemaker\u2019s home! Thank you, as always to my friend @JimmyFallon for letting me come on the show and have some fun! @FallonTonight https://t.co/1LdJo8xpSh Up close or VERY far away, always so fun to sit down with @JimmyFallon but tonight I am giving him a PEACE of my mind!

It\u2019s normally replaced with apathy or arrogance. Neither will nurture growth. When those you love get an opportunity, support them. It more than likely means sacrificing comfort. But also means you\u2019ll be a vehicle in helping someone live their best life. A daily affirmation to be the best version of ourselves. From my Twitter account to the world.

Change is tough. Many times we are afraid of change. Do not expect people to commit to you, if you have not allowed yourself to commit to them. It is dishonest and unfair. RT @Experian_US: Take it from @JohnCena...you\u2019ve been brainwashed if you think any credit app but Experian\u2019s can give you your FICO\u00ae Score\u2026 If you are upset by someone\u2019s perspective of you take the time to choose if they are meaningful to your life. If they are, hear them out. Even if you disagree you might learn about yourself and the person who\u2019s meaningful to you. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any true joy associated with consistent perfection, and I hope I never find out. Never lose hope. The strength of any idea or construct depends on belief. If hope is lost, belief follows. Then a construct is nothing more than words recorded. Life is a collection of obstacles and the success or failure of navigating them. Trusting others will meet expectations can be extremely difficult but try to find a way to give others the chance to amaze or disappoint us. Micromanaging can hold us back from being our best selves. If we have such little faith in others, maybe larger issues should be addressed? RT @WWE: BREAKING: @JohnCena, @WWERomanReigns, @HeymanHustle, @SashaBanksWWE, @StephMcMahon and @TripleH provide a major update on the upco\u2026 If you give all you have to an experience, no matter what the result, the takeaway is rarely regret. Approach the world with less judgment and more curiosity. Less fear, more empathy. Less hate, more love. Value yourself, and you will greater appreciate the value of your time. Don\u2019t try to do everything everyday. Try everyday to give your everything to every thing you can do. Focus more on what you love, not what you think people will love you for. Hard work and persistence are necessary in achieving any goal, but there\u2019s always much more to crossing the finish line. When delegating, working with or for people, be kind. Stay humble, driven, and open minded. Urge yourself to give more credit than you take. Never lose who U R In looking at things we do, don\u2019t overlook the intentions behind the action. Why we do something is tremendously important. The deed can be \u201cgood\u201d but if the intention is \u201cbad\u201d, we need to ask more questions of ourselves. In times of discomfort and sensitivity, look inward. Ask the tough questions, start open dialogue with those you honestly trust not just those who tell you what you want to hear. Working towards a resolve can only happen when the problem and it\u2019s root are truthfully exposed. A small percentage of life is what happens. A large percentage of life is how we react and manage what happens. Work hard to get there, work exponentially harder to stay there. The new year is like a blank page. Make sure you fill it with something worth reading. Here are some tips from @experian_us to help you get started. https://t.co/dMdAkAo6aq Been ready see this project come to audiences since I first stepped on set. Hope you\u2019re as excited as we are! A new interview for @totalfilm hits UK newsstands THIS Friday, January 8th.  #Fast9 #F9 https://t.co/N8YiSw7MYU Past interactions, old relationships, and maybe some interactive gossip can formulate opinions on anyone. To really understand that person, genuinely engage with them. Be brave enough to openly ask what you\u2019d like to know and be curious enough to listen to what they say. It\u2019s hurtful when others continuously need to belittle people to make themselves, their actions and existence feel justified. Know and love you for you. Sinking to that level is a slippery slope of living for the approval of others. Reflect on where you have been. Honestly assess where you are. Look forward to where you\u2019d like to go. Most all of us have redefined our normal in a very trying year. Never lose hope. Hoping the future provides balance, clarity and opportunity. There has been so much to learn in this difficult time. Hoping we do not forget those lessons as we move ahead. Old habits will rarely lead to new experiences. We all cope with tragedy in different ways. There is never a good time to experience loss and we can not know what anyone else is feeling or going thru. In a year of so much hardship, let\u2019s all try to give extra empathy to those around us. RT @ThisBrodieLee: It's Sunday.  You know what that means. If you\u2019re doing it solely to talk about, dive deeper into why you\u2019re doing it. Empathy is a gift that costs next to nothing to give but it can have immeasurable value. With the unprecedented year we have had, work hard to give the gift of genuine empathy. If something is forced it is rarely genuine. Work hard to be genuine. Challenge yourself to discover the truth, not just your truth. On the journey there will be critics and adversaries. One will help you become better the other wants to opportunistically keep you from improvement. Both are fuel for growth. All of us can share moments with the world. In sharing these moments, we allow others to form opinions which may be critical or negative. Expecting universal acceptance of an idea is naively assuming we all think alike. Know and live your boundaries. Surround yourself with those who share values but think different. If everyone around you thinks exactly like you, are you just essentially hanging out with yourself? Do not be nice to someone because they \u201care someone\u201d. Be kind to someone because they are someone. The most impactful way to say something is to do something. Don\u2019t be careful of what you say, be accountable for what you say. Always remain open to the possibly that you may be wrong. If you want to test an individual\u2019s character, study their actions when they are given a sense of power, and then study again when that sense expires. Moving on is always uncomfortable, no matter the circumstances. We tend to reflect on the \u201cgood\u201d and seldom acknowledge what made us move on to begin with. It is not easy, but if you choose to move on, move on. Reflection is useful, just be mindful not to live in the past. On the journey there will be regression, much more than we\u2019d want. In those hard times, lean in, but also take a long look at the whole journey. It will reassure you of your course or provide needed information on course correction. Find growth in every setback. Find joy in every triumph. Earn each day. Strive to be more self aware and less self absorbed. More \u2795 Less \u2797 \u201cFear Of Missing Out\u201d most certainly means you are missing out on where you are right now. Appreciate where you are and what you\u2019re doing. We can\u2019t be everywhere at once. Be grateful for your critics, if you\u2019re open enough to objectively examine their opinions, they could have the honest information you need to improve. If you weren\u2019t worth the time, they would say nothing at all. We never stop learning and growing. \u2018BE A WORK IN PROGRESS\u2019, an illustrated book of favorite uplifting encouragements from my Twitter, will also be available wherever books are sold in April. Stay tuned for a cover reveal and more info! @randomhouse @prhaudio Uplifting words of encouragement can inspire to do great. My new book \u2018Do Your Best Every Day to Do Your Best Every Day\u2019 encourages kids to see the impossible as anything but. #DoYourBestEveryday @randomhousekids\nhttps://t.co/DYDBrVY50n https://t.co/Tu6Wq2dI7o When someone is hurtful there is an urge to hurt back. 2 wrongs do not make a right. The time is much better spent taking care of you and understanding the hurtful person isn\u2019t who you thought they were. Let them live with hate, life is much more enjoyable with love. Loss is incredibly difficult. Those we love are only truly gone if we stop caring. Pat Patterson lived life as it should be lived with passion, love and purpose. He helped so many and always entertained with a story or joke. He will live on in my life always. Love you Patrick. Less cancellations more conversations. Purpose, like person, can evolve. But always strive to have an understanding of why and who you are. Feeling guilted into catering to someone else\u2019s needs is common. Many times it\u2019s a result of not having difficult yet needed conversations. Face those moments because if you give some people a little, they will take and take until a tipping point. Give what you can give, not what you can borrow. Taking a moment to realize what we are grateful for can help a struggling perspective. This has been an unprecedented year in most of our lives. I\u2019m grateful \u2018that the powerful play goes on and we get to contribute a verse.\u2019 Just because something \u201cisn\u2019t you\u201d does not mean it isn\u2019t. Stay curious. An open, logical mind is quite an asset. Put more into making a change, not an excuse. After three decades of @undertaker committing wholeheartedly to the @WWE, tonight we bear witness to the end of an extraordinary body of work. For all the in ring moments and as a member of the @WWEUniverse, I say #ThankYouTaker! #SurvivorSeries #Undertaker30 Work hard, but never get lost in what you\u2019re working for. When you can love without fear, the result is joy. Accountability, owning ones truth, and inspiration (among others) are current popular buzz words. They are easy to say and sound so powerful.  As with most trends, many say it, very few face themselves and do the work  in hopes for genuine growth. Be the few. Do the work. Archiving moments is important but be careful not to let the capturing of the moment exceed the importance of the moment. Be just a little more giving than you were yesterday. Learning and growth from positive or unfortunate experiences can be much stronger takeaways than explaining your actions to the world. RT @WWEIndia: It's HE, the guy you can't SEE, @JohnCena wishing the WWE Universe in #India a #HappyDiwali! https://t.co/BfFxmHsTVz Treat conversation less like a competition and more like an opportunity. If people reach out to you only when they can gain and benefit from your life, take notice. True \u201cfamily\u201d weathers both the highs and lows of life and does the work to forge lasting and meaningful bonds where ALL involved gain and grow. The recent surge in awareness of the importance to vote and how much our voice can be heard is heartwarming. Let us not forget those who\u2019ve served to allow us this right. #VeteransDay If you consistently see only the burden in opportunities and ignore the potential, get comfortable where you are because you might be there for a while. Think less about being a trend. Think more about being authentically you. We are all characters in the powerful play. Many of the most rewarding roles belong to those vulnerable enough to believe in themselves. Never just see the finish line. Embrace the courage to start and the perseverance of the journey. Minimize the urge to create problems, far too many will create themselves. There is rarely a more toxic mixture than thinking you know it all and constantly worrying about the perception others have of you. Activate. Navigate. Communicate.

Invest in where you are. Arrive at where you want to be. Repeat. Don\u2019t make your partner jealous of others, make others jealous of your partner. Sometimes life serves us a crap sandwich with no bread. Might just be the universe saying \u2018time to limit the carbs\u2019? Have a filter. Boundaries are important to overall mental health. They can protect us when we need but still allow the possibility of meaningful connection. Try your best at the end of any experience (good or bad) to take the time you need to absorb what\u2019s happened. You might surprise yourself with how much you\u2019ve learned.

If you look at every problem you\u2019ve ever had in life, they all always involve the same one person. Whenever things go wrong, start there. It might help more than you know. Live grounded. Dream grand. Love gratefully. Never lose hope. Much of the struggle with growth is the alternative. Comfort is safe, relaxing, and in most cases predictable. Growth is risky, painful, and unforeseen. It can\u2019t always be done but try harder to lean towards growth instead of comfort. Be prepared. Be persistent. Be reliable. Be surprised at what can be accomplished. Get lost in it, just don\u2019t get caught up in it. We define who we are when we persevere in the face of obstacles.

Cheers #BTS forever a class act #WeAreNotSevenWithYou Love involves constant effort. When you are truly ready to let love in and give to love all it needs to flourish, I feel there is no greater more rewarding connection. It is what it is until it isn\u2019t. Don\u2019t just envision financial success; act on it. A great way to get started is by improving your credit scores. Here are some tips from @Experian_US: https://t.co/CLs9CmlSG8 Believe in what you do. It doesn\u2019t make the hard days easier, but it does make them more rewarding.

Any finish line is merely the start of the next race. We cannot be everywhere at once. When we commit focus to one thing it will take focus from something else. Be honest with ourselves and others about our choices and commitments. If you are in a situation where joy comes from approval of others, rather than the actual doing of the deed, you might spend far too long searching for joy. Time keeps moving, make sure you do as well. Never give up. Actions define who we are. When mixed messages are put forth by our actions, especially without admittance and ownership, it\u2019s a glaring indication that we need to ask some questions and do some hard work on discovering who we REALLY are.

It should not be overlooked that it takes constant work. If you decide to no longer work on love, you are essentially deciding not to love. Constantly examine what you believe and why you believe it. Relevance can be extremely productive on the path to success. It can also be extremely counterproductive if it\u2019s traded for authenticity. Life is a delicate, beautiful gift that we are given to hold, mold, experience and then return. Earn the gift. Find your purpose. Live your passion. Embrace love. Allow joy. Be grateful.

Hmmm.\n\nCatch a new episode of #DallasAndRobo during @tzgz_syfy, Saturday at midnight-ish, only on @SYFY. https://t.co/etrlK4ePf2 Life is a series of opportunities. Our lives are the story of those we take and those we don\u2019t. You have only one right now. What you do with it should be based on the wisdom accrued from the past and will forge a path for the future. What will you do with your \u201cnow\u201d? Be authentic. Finding inspiration from others could help you be your best self. Trying to be others could prevent you for ever finding yourself. Spreading the news of a great organization. @WHOAFRO region is now certified wild polio-free! Amazing work done by @Rotary and others. https://t.co/MnHPm8EISR #EndPolio https://t.co/JbPnLPkgfe You\u2019re only as good as your next one. Never give up. Reflect, relive, reminisce and remember moments that have brought you to be where you are. Never close those chapters, \u201clock them up\u201d or \u201csolve\u201d the cases. Stay curious about your life and past to possibly better understand the present and future. Creating a \u201c@WrestleMania moment\u201d any year can be a difficult feat but the creativity awarded us through those challenges can expand our Universe even further. To everyone taking that challenge tonight at #SummerSlam, good luck! We\u2019re all counting on you! @WWENetwork https://t.co/DijMpz0svx When Dallas give you helping... hand, you TAKE IT!.

Now you can plan out in advance what panels you don\u2019t want to miss on August 2\u2026 Change first requires us to admit the need to change. A giant force in preventing growth is the inability to admit accountability for the problem. Be brave enough to identify the need and origin for change and it will come. It takes time and work but it will come. We tend to hate what we don\u2019t understand. Spend less time hating and more time attempting to understand. Honesty and communication are the cornerstones to any successful relationship, including the one you have with yourself. We\u2019re as excited as Woodman on his favorite day! #DallasandRobo comes to @tzgz_syfy TONIGHT at midnight-ish @SYFY https://t.co/imuw3Ueh6x RT @tzgz_syfy: You got it, Robo, I'll never call you a robot again.

It\u2019s forced me to look deep within to see if they are right. \u2018Family\u2019 are those with the closest connection. Families fight, have setbacks, issues, and problems like everyone else. But Family hangs in there, no matter how long it takes, to work thru the issues and grow stronger. I love and am grateful for my \u2018Family\u2019. Tune in TOMORROW August 1 from 9-11am for this year\u2019s virtual #BFFSchoolBash2020 to see a special reading of \u201cElbow Grease vs. Motozilla!\u201d \nAn awesome event put on @TitusONeilWWE and @BFFTAMPA.\n\nWatch it all here:\nhttps://t.co/d8PEisJE0t https://t.co/KwZX4QIEjm I am officially staying up late Friday night to hopefully have a chance to tackle this challenge! I truly enjoy piano and LEGO. Thank you @LEGO_Group for keeping my mind sharp and combining these worlds. Look forward to the build! https://t.co/vAGrcSzhSe Be fierce. Be tender. Be aware enough to know when to be which. Be grateful for each sunrise. Earn each sunset. The day is not lost if it doesn\u2019t go according to plan. The day is lost if you give up on the day. Never try to change a person, and don\u2019t expect a person to never change. Grind without passion will grind to a halt. Love what and who you give your time to. People of earth! #DallasAndRobo is hitting #TZGZ, @SYFY\u2019s animated side, Saturday 8/8 at midnight-ish. Check out @tzgz_syfy to see the greatest space trucker tandem since Han and Chewy! https://t.co/Dr54PeA2Ln Anxiety gets to us all. No need to make it a deal until it\u2019s a deal, when it\u2019s a deal, deal with it the best you can. How do you find out if something is the true true truth? Here are three simple steps courtesy of myself and my unlikely twin! @LastWeekTonight \n\nhttps://t.co/IIaTJdWrZY I bet on myself that night, the usual amount. Not a smart wager choosing the guy who can\u2019t wrestle over the best in the world, but I\u2019d like to think we all won that night. Thank you for allowing me to be part of something so many were entertained by. https://t.co/Tpj8RV55zV https://t.co/FW9QYw3Sq6 Live for life, not for legacy. Don\u2019t selectively listen to people that only share your point of view. Be open enough to listen, objectively, to all sides. It will either affirm your stance or bring about an entirely new set of questions. When times are difficult often we feel guilty experiencing joy. Allow joy in your life. Joy during such difficulty shouldn\u2019t make you feel guilty. Use it as a way to remain aware of issues, be genuinely grateful for the good you do have and spread that joy to those in need. If you have trouble trusting others, start by asking how well you trust yourself. It\u2019s normal to feel good when we are \u201ccorrect\u201d. But being \u201ccorrect\u201d just for the sake of a point, especially disregarding all possible information, might be a deeper issue with not being correct. Work hard and push yourself, but do not neglect self care, rest, and recovery. No one has every answer. Those who do, have yet to properly challenge themselves. Why dance? My purple cow &amp; I have helped raise FICO\u00ae Scores over 25 million total points with #ExperianBoost. Boost your own FICO Score now, then share a happy #BoostDance &amp; tag @Experian_US. You could win a CreditWorks\u2122 package worth over $300! https://t.co/Ro9g3UPnmi (0 under) https://t.co/GmlnpD8beL Sometimes getting lost is one of the best ways to find your destination. Be OK with failure. It sucks and makes us feel all types of ways. Through those emotions there is ALWAYS wisdom if you choose to find it. Failure and facing it can be a helpful tool to success. Is multitasking just another way of trying to do a bunch but ultimately doing little? Life has it\u2019s difficult days, it\u2019s always worth it. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all. For all. #HappyFourthOfJuly Often times when good things happen we speculate on when \u201cthe other shoe will drop\u201d. Being prepared is more than ok, but it\u2019s also ok to allow joy without condition into your life. Very proud of the work @fit_ops is doing for our veteran population and honored to be involved with this cause. The community surrounding our veterans is important so thank you to @theCHIVE for supporting! https://t.co/juYutB8cXJ Be thankful for those who help you find you. Be loving to those who make you your best you. Instead of investing your time to prove to others you are good enough, approach each day knowing you are good enough. It might help reduce some unnecessary difficulties. It is an honor to join the DC Multiverse as a part of #TheSuicideSquad cast. Hopefully you have questions and we\u2019re about to get you (some \ud83e\udd2b) answers! https://t.co/sBBrfT5XAN #DCFanDome https://t.co/h1x2Cy9xnt Thank you for all the well wishes on the anniversary of a day I\u2019ll never forget. @WWE is and always will be home for me. Thank you for allowing me to pursue my passion for so many years, none of it is possible without you. https://t.co/uFFmSmnEvv It\u2019s natural to see the world through our own eyes and base our choices off of what our best interests are. Don\u2019t shy away from understanding how those choices affect others and if they are painful for others. Be accountable for each choice and it\u2019s consequences. Ask yourself more questions........ about yourself. Looking inward honestly and without bias takes courage, but you can find out more than you\u2019ve ever imagined. Worry less about being perfect. Focus more on being real. #BlackLivesMatter https://t.co/GIEYsx91Es Every @WWE Superstar looks to make \u2018moments.\u2019 From the character, the performance, and non-stop dedication to craft, @Undertaker has done it for over 30 years. Excited to watch the final part of #TheLastRide on @WWENetwork. https://t.co/eE13NBZQBV Hope is a beautiful thing. Effort is understood and admired by many. Hope and effort together is a great recipe for making impossible possible. I firmly believe that empathy is the foundation to building understanding and orchestrating change. Thank you \u2066@tylerperry\u2069 for your brave perspective.  https://t.co/uYt3no4j5z Perspective is an underrated tool. Challenge yourself to change it constantly. A virtual experience brought to you by DC! Explore every corner of the DC Multiverse with a Global Virtual Experience on August 22. https://t.co/WpG8sY2i6f  #DCFanDome https://t.co/MsP2kHzQhZ Be defined by your actions, not their words. Dont think for someone, listen to them. It is very disheartening when acts of kindness become misinterpreted by those simply chasing headlines. Overlooking all the information to tell a great story is the basis for fiction. Pushing a fictional agenda can take a kind act and turn it on its head. Change is never easy because it takes us admitting that our efforts and methods may be flawed to a point of severe distortion. Be brave and open minded in these moments. Welcome ideas and limit excuses. Change is uncomfortable but can yield much more joy for all in the long run. Very happy to join #BTSARMY in efforts to match @BTS_twt tremendous donation #ARMYMatch1M One of the many reasons I respect @BTS_twt and #ARMY #ARMYMatch1M #ArmyMatchedForBLM thank you #BTS and #BTSARMY https://t.co/2XpaHR6mFP Do not let what\u2019s been done cloud your vision of what you can do. Remember the great accomplishments of the past. Live each day forging ahead for the betterment of humankind. Create a future of joy, unity, and prosperity for all. https://t.co/6VElLl4u5x Put forth effort to achieve gain, not just to avoid loss. Do your best to do what is right, don\u2019t just settle for what is easy. Change is always possible. A major catalyst to change is facing uncomfortable truths, leaning into them and realizing that tremendous effort is needed on a consistent and dedicated basis with the goal of improvement. https://t.co/5oaWWaqrEs Thank you @TitusONeilWWE now more than ever we need to lean into the uncomfortable and forge positive permanent change. https://t.co/yk46uFE0wE We all have flaws. Facing our flaws is a very difficult process but is the only way to effectively grow. If an individual, group, title or idea ever gets to a point of assuming flawlessness, accountability is lost and positive change becomes next to impossible. Be more diverse and less divided. Do your best everyday to do your best everyday. Love yourself and also put effort into the world around you. You have value, and so does the rest of this great planet. Make kindness less unique and more commonplace. We are defined by our actions. Work each and every day to live by the values you identify as important. Today we remember all those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for the idea that all of us are created equal and we each have the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. #MemorialDay Be kind. Walk the talk. Do right. When called upon, give your all to deliver. Earn each day. A huge congratulations and THANK YOU to @Nickelodeon, Mark Burnett, and our producing partners for creating a wonderful family-based, educational and FUN show! A great experience and thrilled to hear it was nominated for such an honor. https://t.co/umDpbEdEMz If you enjoy what you are doing it has a better chance to bring you to where you want to be. Approach the uncomfortable with those you love and trust. They may not understand, but their honesty and support could help make \u201cdifficult\u201d a bit less difficult. Be passionate without expecting others to care. Be invested without expecting others to approve. Be fluid in your evolution without expecting others to change. I\u2019d say about half the time I\u2019m almost 100% right, sometimes. So many times in relationships of any kind, fear of hurting those involved leads to either lying or withholding the truth, and long term can lead to a whole lot more hurt for everyone. Be grateful for your critics. Their thoughts and opinions can help you learn about yourself and also teach you a lot about who they really are. Don\u2019t expect anyone to know your thoughts and feelings except yourself. Be brave enough to express and explain them to those worthy when needed. Open your mind before you open your mouth. Had the opportunity to watch #TheLastRide on @WWENetwork last night. An incredible performer, a storied character, a remarkable story and the benchmark for professional respect in the @WWE. Cannot wait to watch the next episodes. I love you Mom. For everything that you are and all you\u2019ve given me a chance to be. #HappyMothersDay Do right. Strive to live joyful. Know you are enough. Earn each day. Tackling the issues of others is a noble experiment that should be addressed only after tackling the issues of yourself. Never lose your curiosity for life. Dr. Shannon, you are the real deal! Having men like you on the frontlines gives us all hope. On behalf of @WWE, thank you for your hard work and selflessness. Show your appreciation to the healthcare heroes in your community by making your own \u201cjersey\u201d for these #TheRealHeroes. https://t.co/WpQauKb86I Don\u2019t take someone else\u2019s word on what you can accomplish. Join the world of sports this Wednesday on National Nurses Day, as we honor the frontline healthcare heroes who inspire us. Create your own \u201cjersey\u201d in their honor and tag your post with #TheRealHeroes to help cheer your hero on! https://t.co/7Nr7qpwV19 To find your limits, you must face failure. Failure does not mean you quit. Facing failure and applying the lesson failure can yield is a great way to make impossible, possible. \u201cIt\u201d is over when all hope is lost, even through the most trying of times, never lose hope. To #grads2020: Enjoy the victory of graduation. Do not forget all the things that brought you to this moment. To recognize your accomplishment I am sharing a reading from @DrSeuss #OhThePlacesYoullGo as part of a special #ohtheplaces2020 celebration. https://t.co/5qV8H4SVEt https://t.co/i7LYMHolLy Shame is among the toughest, if not the toughest opponent we will ever face. It is never easy, ever. But because it\u2019s so difficult, if we are brave enough to fight, the rewards it can yield can be life changing. Believe in you and never short change your value. I\u2019ve had the honor of granting more than 650 Wishes and counting. Today is a day to celebrate @MakeAWish and their incredible milestone of 40 years of granting wishes. #WorldWishDay https://t.co/jGVweqBOAu Talk with someone, not about someone. Pain of any kind, physical, emotional, or mental is your body sending a message. If ignored, you may expect the same or worse in the future. Recognize it, get to the \u201cwhy\u201d of the message, ask for help, and come up with an approach to move forward as best you can. Never discount the value of small acts and small gestures. Especially when it comes to kindness. Give of yourself to those you love. Expect nothing in return. https://t.co/jYRUlHfjZQ Never forget that we all have value. No matter what hardship or setback any journey takes us on. Crisis can breed opportunity, remember to do the research to make sure the opportunity lines up with your values. Be bold and accountable because our choices define who we are. The connections you have in your life should add value, not take value away. Be who you say you are. This sounds easy, but how many people do you know that project one life, then live another? Let\u2019s work hard to make sure we try and walk the talk. What are your values? We might not ask this enough? Having a clear understanding of what is important on our journey of life can help us greatly with any decision, simple or difficult. Loss of any kind is not easy. We feel some, if not all difficult emotions. Feel them, face them, don\u2019t lock them up, but do so with a brave sense of accountability. All of us are tested now more than ever. Stay in touch and in tune with you, try to find lessons in any hardship. You will be faced with many challenges today. Whenever possible, handle these challenges with logic, kindness, patience, and empathy. To know who you are is to know who you are not. Be bold enough to listen to things you disagree with. Adapt. Overcome. Never give up. Believe in yourself enough to honestly listen to the feedback of others. Uncertainty brings about many challenges. One of the toughest, most important challenges we face each day is to be our best selves. It\u2019s a challenge certainly worth the effort. All things end. When it\u2019s time to leave, leave them guessing. Have a clear understanding of what you want to accomplish. Use the tools you have access to. Do your absolute best. Evaluate. Repeat. When given opportunity without direction, take initiative. Be bold. Win or lose, do all you can with the opportunity. #WrestleMania https://t.co/zdNUxVAo5I Night 1 of #WrestleMania was incredible! Thrilled I wasn\u2019t facing @Undertaker until I realized I step into the #FireflyFunhouse TONIGHT. I have a feeling it\u2019s gonna get .... weird. Tune into the @WWENetwork TONITE! @WWE #WrestleMania begins TONITE! I\u2019m excited to be a part of this event, STILL not sure what\u2019s in the funhouse but ready to entertain and be entertained. 7pm on the @WWENetwork ... I\u2019ll C U There!!! The final #SmackDown where hopefully someone can tell me about the #FireflyFunhouse. The final show, the last words until a history making event at #WrestleMania. \nC U TONITE on @WWEonFOX!! @WWE How did we get here? Why are we here? WHAT IS A FIREFLY FUN HOUSE MATCH? Don\u2019t know the answer to any of those questions but had a great pre-#WrestleMania chat with @WWEGraves on @AfterTheBellWWE! https://t.co/Pdic3XgYDo Never making a mistake, is a mistake. Try, fail, learn, grow. Find your path and boldly explore. When you are scared, afraid, unsure, lost, or even down, lean on those you love. The power of love from family and friends, if you let it in, can do amazing things. Each wasted second is a second wasted. Empathy could quite possibly be one of the most helpful tools in navigating the current landscape. If you are not sure what it is, take a second to study it. If you do know, do your best to use it as much as you can. The uncomfortable is a difficult place to be, but also provides a platform to grow if you allow yourself. It\u2019s VERY hard, but do your best to see the gain and growth thru the uncomfortable. If given an opportunity and you choose to take it, especially in times where opportunities are heavily diminished, give it your best, be accountable for your choices, and be grateful. With so many suffering, complaining thru success may not be the best choice. Adjusting to any \u201cuncomfortable\u201d is stressful, frustrating, and definitely a learning curve. Be mindful through challenging times that many others are fighting thru their own set of problems as well. Kindness, tolerance, and patience take extra work, but have a huge impact. If given the opportunity to create, be bold. Understand you will not please everyone and criticism is a natural response to putting yourself out there. Don\u2019t create for any other reason than you\u2019ve been given the opportunity to do so, embrace the entire process and it\u2019s lessons Frustration and unrest can come easily when the future is unclear. Don\u2019t be afraid to talk to those you love and trust. Sometimes just putting thoughts out in the universe, and having someone listen, can subdue stress tremendously. Do things for the reward of doing them. Any reward after that is a bonus. New characters, new friendships, and new fun lessons. Thanks to @GMA #GMABookClub for helping me debut the newest installment in the #ElbowGrease series... Elbow Grease: Fast Friends! \n\nhttps://t.co/6zme6HFwhC https://t.co/G9vVtA0eYi The immediate future of the already uncertain and uncomfortable times will bring tremendous challenge to us all. Control the controllable, be the best you that you can be, and use effort to be as calm and logical as possible in this rapidly changing landscape. \u2764\ufe0f You are not born with character. It is forged by your choices. I\u2019ve been incredibly fortunate to be a part of some \u201chistoric\u201d moments. There is a lot going on, but tonight our family will bring entertainment to yours. #Smackdown TONIGHT on @WWEonFox! @WWE Crisis and uncertainty are breeding grounds for panic. We all have feelings and need to recognize them good, or bad. But especially thru unrest, our brains, and logical thought will be our strongest ally. We evolve everyday. Continue to be curious about who you become. Keep the same curiosity for those relationships you hold dear. If you think you fully know someone, you might not be trying hard enough. You have 1440 minutes each day to choose who and what gets your attention. Embrace the deal. And at the same time, keep track of your deal. We tend to be nicer when we are not mean. When was the last time you had a real conversation with someone who had an opposing view? Blocking, interrupting, banning, not listening to anyone who may oppose your viewpoint doesn\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d a discussion, it prevents one. Control the controllable. The disorder of others is only your chaos if you make it so. Don\u2019t let a failed plan ruin the rest of your day. Take it in. Take a moment. Regroup. Refocus, and move forward the best you can. In any relationship do not try to change someone to be the best them for you. Be the best you for your relationship and find those that love you because of it. Want to thank @WWEonFOX and more importantly @WWEUniverse for such an emotional experience on #Smackdown. I went to Boston to say \u2018goodbye\u2019 but realized that no matter where life takes me, @WWE is always home.\nNow, onto #WrestleMania! https://t.co/XFFPQg6bHR Good friends, great @MichelobULTRA beer and a love for enjoyment, is all you need to win an official Team ULTRA endorsement deal, so go visit https://t.co/ahMQRqJOu3 and apply. #DoItForTheCheers #TeamULTRAcontest How we view ourselves is often not how we are perceived by others.

Be accountable for it. Sharing with the world gives the world the right to formulate whatever opinion it wants. If you have no boundaries on what is shared, you can have no grievance with how it\u2019s interpreted. Relived some great memories (and younger \ud83e\udd7atimes) watching #RuthlessAggression on @WWENetwork. I\u2019m now staring at my watch counting the hours until next week\u2019s #Smackdown. So excited to come back to my @WWE family in the place I grew up! \u201cC\u201d you in BOSTON!!! @WWEonFOX https://t.co/yeOHgeLKop How many times have you regretted what you said? How many times have you regretted what you heard? Do not discount how others describe you. Assess the source, the comments, and the intent. It will either help you learn more about you, or learn a lot about those you give your time to. Take ownership of your mistakes. Shifting blame will never spark growth. \u201cA happy marriage is a long conversation that always seems too short\u201d - Andre\u2019 Maurois Any of us can find an excuse to be distracted, challenge yourself to come up with more excuses to be present. Never stop learning.\nNever stop loving.\nNever stop living. Managing our own daily life is not easy, it takes facing and dealing with the good and the bad. Relationships are no different except you add in another daily life to the equation. Enjoy the good, deal with the bad, open up to each other, and lasting love will be the result. Today seems like the perfect day to announce I\u2019m in a new relationship! It\u2019s someone truly rare\u2026well, not like medium-rare, just unique. You\u2019ll see. @Experian_US #Boooost #ValentinesDay https://t.co/wmH1TYrUrE You either win or you learn. A loss only occurs if you are incapable of honestly reflecting on the experience and unable do the work to grow. Thank you to @WWE for allowing me the opportunity to come to #Smackdown @WWEonFOX to promote a project nearly 20 years in the making. #InvisibleMan \ud83d\udd90\ud83d\ude01 https://t.co/vN3FcK8RN2 https://t.co/OWqhxUPyB6 Compete each day with you. Looking at the lives of others can be interesting but can also severely eat away at self worth. Be your best you. Don\u2019t get hung up on what someone else \u201chas\u201d or \u201cdoes\u201d. Use that energy for you. If you say you love someone, love them. Don\u2019t \u201clove them\u201d and be in search for something or someone else. Put yourself INTO those words by owning what they embody. There is no greater feeling that being in love. All of us have problems and facing them is tough. Let\u2019s try our best to face issues as soon as they\u2019re discovered. Making excuses, shifting blame, or projecting a \u201cperfect life\u201d will just lead to deeper problems. Ask for help, be honest, do the work, and the result will be growth Do your best to learn something each day. Anything, even if it\u2019s something about yourself or your surroundings. As time passes, you won\u2019t get younger, but you can get wiser. Don\u2019t let those who want to manipulate you forge who you are. Trying to help someone and trying to change someone are two different things. One can be highly rewarding to most all involved, the other can be self centered, controlling, and destructive. Love that lasts takes work. Tremendous work. Anyone who thinks differently has little perspective of the timeline and totality of existence. Don\u2019t fear love, but do not ignorantly proceed in thinking it comes without effort. If you are routing against someone, ask why? Sometimes it IS because there are genuine bad people out there, many times it is us judging and being insecure with ourselves. Be brave enough to embrace humility. The reward will be confidence.

When I say nothing, I mean nothing. #FaceTheIntensity @TakisUSA https://t.co/csSoAU4PsR I\u2019ve found myself at times wanting to improve and then just leaning on words like \u201cit\u2019s just how it is\u201d\u201dit\u2019s how I was brought up\u201d\u201dit\u2019s what I know\u201d\u201dit\u2019s just who I am\u201d among others as excuses not to face issues and grow. Change is a choice and if you want it, choose it. Excited to be back with the #FastFamily next weekend in Miami. We\u2019re gearing up for our giant F9 concert and trailer drop on Friday, 1/31. \n\n\u2764\ufe0f this Tweet to receive content from @TheFastSaga and get F9 content before the movie comes out in theaters 5/22. https://t.co/jHr3XnffbW Others will dislike you. Others will disagree with you. Over time, if you are consistent in sticking to your values and beliefs, others will respect you. We are so quick to find flaws with those who try. Succeed or fail, those who try will be far wiser, braver, stronger, and more ready to try again than the passive skeptic. Conforming is easy, with very little resistance and it\u2019s mostly judgement free. It takes great bravery to do something different, it takes even more bravery to stick with it. Kudos to all those out there living a life that\u2019s theirs. \u201cWe are, each of us, the sum of what we attend to in life.\u201d - Kate Murphy Let them see you sweat, hurt, fall, fail, cry, bleed, crack, falter, suffer, struggle, persist, rise, fight, grow, improve, gain, triumph, and above all let them see your joy. But NEVER let them see you give up. If you are brave enough to do the work needed to love yourself, create a support system of those equally as brave. Be authentic. Set values and stand by them, over the long haul. Especially when they are brought into question, not just when it\u2019s convenient or popular. A great way to be there for those you love is to, first and foremost, be there for yourself. The power of joy is contagious, so is negativity. Love you, and devote time to you. That way you make your day and those around you as well. When called upon, do your best. That\u2019s all anyone can ask. While my Doctorate in Thuganomics doesn\u2019t cover zoology, I\u2019ve been challenged to find these animals hiding in plain sight! Hear me as Yoshi the polar bear in @DolittleMovie in theaters Friday! https://t.co/mjubUDBpHA We all want to share are views. Don\u2019t neglect the views of others. Listening, and watching will allow you to separate authenticity from hypocrisy. Never outgrow being thankful. Great to join together the magic of cinema and the magic of @WWE together today at the #DolittleMovie premiere. U can C it in theaters THIS Friday! @RobertDowneyJr @WWERollins @BeckyLynchWWE https://t.co/8gldSVzlMq It is emotionally difficult and draining when those close to you can not live their truth. Continued support of this concept will disable any possible growth, for all involved. Honesty and action, usually in the form of boundaries, can help move forward. Yoshi the polar bear and I have a lot in common. We love to spend time with our friends, enjoy a nice sun tan and cannot wait for the premiere of @DolittleMovie Friday, January 17th! #DolittleMovie https://t.co/ITkE5GqTpx Our choices in life greatly affect us and those around us. How will you choose to live today? We are now connected to more people, information, and entertainment than ever. Still, more and more struggle with loneliness. Try and not do \u201ca million things at once\u201d, be present with those who make an effort to connect with you. You may just end up finding a lifelong friend. There is a lesson to be learned in every failure (unicycles included!!). The lesson here may be U didn\u2019t C ME! Congratulations on the new single! @JustinBieber https://t.co/nnZsULcUjj Make sure you are more of a person, than a persona. How many people have you totally let into your life? For many out there the number is 0. We have all been betrayed, it hurts, but if you\u2019re brave enough to continue to try and let people in, when someone does connect with you. They will know and love you for who you really are. We all have many differences that make us unique, still, we are all human. We all have real emotions. Words and actions can heavily impact those they\u2019re directed towards. We are free to say and do as we choose, we must NEVER overlook being accountable for those words and actions. Reflect on what has been, look forward to what can be, live in each moment and use what you\u2019ve learned right now to get you where you want to go. A resolution without effort is a dream. Turn your dream into a true resolution, get up, get going, and realize that any firm choice to change your ways, no matter how small it may seem, involves tremendous effort. Wishing all a safe, happy, and joyous 2020 #happynewyear2020 #HappyNewYear This is the embodiment of #NeverGiveUp. \nBenjamin demonstrates courage, perseverance, vulnerability, tremendous strength... and he\u2019s an ARTIST! I admire you, your work, and your outlook.\n\nhttps://t.co/HtChYVAj32 Tis the season of promises for the year to come. Instead of vague goals that easily get lost in the shuffle, focus on specifics. That way if you achieve it, great! If you don\u2019t, you can honestly reflect on the experience to see what could\u2019ve been improved. If you are a self proclaimed negative person, and a positive thought resonates with you, hopefully you may have incorrectly evaluated your being. Sometimes the most productive days we have are the days that absolutely nothing productive gets done at all. \u201cDon\u2019t ever change\u201d is a very unrealistic request. We should always be in a state of growth and change. During that constant process \u201cDon\u2019t ever lose sight of who you are\u201d. There is no greater feeling than the support, challenge, and love you feel from those close to you. To all those who offer this each and everyday, I love you. Thank you. Need a last-minute gift idea?\n\nElbow Grease vs. Motozilla, an exciting story of grit, gumption and the importance of teamwork, makes the perfect gift for readers of all ages.\n\nAvailable wherever books are sold: https://t.co/mBAKOZ5epp https://t.co/orI3EkbmwO A HUGE start to what will be a big weekend in Miami. What better way to release the new @TheFastSaga trailer than with the entire family. MIAMI, hope to c u there!!! https://t.co/0SabFvRDew Projecting the \u201cperfect life\u201d is a heavier burden than most any truth. Love you. Be you. Find your purpose. \nFuel your journey. \nNever Give Up. https://t.co/axSyCV46qD Run with those faster than you. If you become a \u201ccheap copy\u201d of someone else be prepared to be treated as such. Consumed quickly and quickly discarded. Be the best version of YOU, and those invested in you, will love you for life. You can not keep someone from becoming who they want to be. You can openly explain your values and beliefs, live by them, and find people who understand that and/or make similar choices. If you think any of these messages are about you, you\u2019re right. They stem from me examining self but are put forth with the hope they can resonate with you and yours. So... either Yoshi nailed that audition. OR he was asking @RobertDowneyJr a very, very personal question!! https://t.co/wV09ZJSvwB The only decisions you should make when you are tired, hungry, and angry should be how to - get food, get rest, get to a level headspace You can find inspiration in anything, just don\u2019t lose yourself in the process. Never seen @shanemcmahon need \u201cbody armor\u201d for ANYTHING! I can\u2019t imagine what will happen tonight! https://t.co/U0WGKqGLZ3 If we work our bodies, 9 times out of 10, we MUST warm up before pushing ourselves. Take the same approach with mind and soul. Even just a few minutes of reflection, foresight, and perspective before you \u201chit the ground running\u201d might just help you run better. Relationships that last (work,love,friends)are the ones that balance the needs of all involved. Never discount the power of \u201cbeing there\u201d for those close to you. Sometimes the best thing we can do is  just listen. Thank you to all those who\u2019ve listened and enjoyed! If you have no idea what this is, head to @audible_com to check it out! https://t.co/t80r7jh3pA Quality and durability of relationships are defined through tension. Those that endure tough times maybe few, but they will be the most fulfilling and the longest lasting. Ask questions. Challenge norms. Seek answers, to everything in life, especially to the reflection starting back at you. Most of the time this is very difficult, but the end product is more than worth it. If you never fail, you will never really know what you are capable of. Challenge yourself to GIVE credit, rather than demand it. All of us work very hard and it\u2019s 100% human to want to be appreciated, but instead of scoffing at or rooting against others successes, be brave enough to let them know they\u2019ve inspired you. Spend a few days replacing the words \u201cdeserve(d)\u201d and \u201cowe(d)\u201d with \u201cearn(ed)\u201d. Might change your perspective and invite a few more interesting follow up thoughts and questions. Enduring hardship will provide you wisdom. Ignoring hardship will provide you a false sense of perfection. On this and everyday I am thankful for the lessons, the love, and the challenge of life. Millions of you, thru the good and bad, have made me who I am today. Thank you. #Happythanksgiving2019 #happythanksgivng @RobertDowneyJr Let\u2019s get this party started! https://t.co/7DuGYIcT6S Relax. Enjoy. And spend time with family all together. (We\u2019ve been practicing!) See #PlayingWithFireMovie this #Thanksgiving weekend! https://t.co/wVQnGIy32I https://t.co/o224qF6HsT There is a great sense of accomplishment when someone works hard to make their purpose relevant. Those who\u2019s purpose IS relevance, might never be fulfilled. Everyone won\u2019t always agree with you. Before becoming hurtful and defensive, try your best to see things from all points of view. Disagreements don\u2019t always need to end in pain and heartache. Know the difference between managing life so you enjoy it and your values are intact, and becoming consumed and self absorbed. One will show you the beauty of the world and keep your mind open, the other is a breeding ground for entitlement, complacency, and false fulfillment. Be honest.\nBe grateful.\nBe unafraid of who you are. Life may have problems, but it should never be a problem. A common reaction to someone challenging our values is to be aggressively defensive, often even being OFFENSIVE and hurtful to the challenger thru actions. Instead, hear them out. It will either help you grow or show you the challenger isn\u2019t worth your time. We tend to measure success in things, \u201cgrind\u201d, or status, among others. Measure it in joy instead, it\u2019s a much better gauge. There will always be those that try to shame your progress. Those who feel every single thing you do is an attack on them. Sadly it\u2019s just a lack of empathy and if they feel an improving you is a bad you, give yourself distance from that type of manipulation. Opportunity has lots to do with timing and maybe a little luck. Results are much more dependent on effort. Look back on it all with a smile. Look forward to it all with excitement. Plant yourself here in the now with purpose. THANK YOU to everyone who came out to see #PlayingWithFireMovie and made it the #1 Comedy in America!!! Thrilled to share this fun family ride with everyone! See it in theaters this weekend!https://t.co/wVQnGIy32I https://t.co/yMGsDpnNHh If something is important in life, make it important. If you never take a chance, you may never fail, but you also may never succeed in anything expect staying right where you are. Thank you @Lilly for scaring the \ud83d\udca9 out of me!! I kid, thank you for allowing me to talk @PlayingWFire and have some late night fun! Don't miss @latewithlilly tonight! It all starts at 1:35/12:35c on @nbc! https://t.co/4D7s4pE61x Being inspired by others is a helpful way to find yourself. Wanting to be others is a helpful way to lose yourself. Ask the difficult questions, start the difficult conversations, do the difficult work. With empathy, effort, patience, and persistence...impossible can become reality. #VeteransDay https://t.co/dKiGOprBFt Glad you\u2019re enjoying the \u201cmandatory vacation\u201d \ud83d\ude09Shane-O!

So excited to hear the response to #PlayingWithFireMovie this weekend! https://t.co/wVQnGIy32I #SundayMantinee https://t.co/EDtEhN4Wm4 Be comfortable with yourself. This is a VERY tough task because no one wants to seem incapable, \u201cuncool\u201d, or even ashamed of who we are. When you reach a point to #Loveyourself understanding and dealing with those feelings becomes far more manageable. Work to be your best you. I\u2019m John Cena and I have a couple of questions to ask you. #PlayingWithFireMovie https://t.co/c8JMfuskKP https://t.co/tMMTjbOY0i An extra-special part of the #PlayingWithFireMovie Premiere!

Not just in career but in all of life. Often people just focus on hard work instead of being aware and grateful to all those who help make things possible. The people you love and those that love you shouldn\u2019t want to change you, they should allow you to be the best you A beautiful look at what will be an incredible journey for movie goers this January. Honored to be included in such an amazing group and for such an epic tale. #DolittleMovie https://t.co/FqqpPyMSEk Many out there will make it a goal to make you feel inferior or inadequate strictly to try and cause you pain or embarrassment. Recognize it for what it is, their struggle with self. Rise above that hate. I want to say thank you to all who follow this platform for allowing me, recently, to keep you up to speed on projects in my life. Some you may dig, others may not be you. Just saying I\u2019m grateful for your patience to hear me out. None of any of this happens without you. Thanks. If someone takes a chance on you, prove them right. Give your all and seize the opportunity at hand. Know that you are working for something larger than self. Be diligent. Be grateful. Succeed or fail, it will say more about who you are than the most carefully constructed verse.

If you are closed off by the boundaries of another it can be painful, but also gives us a chance to examine ourselves. Most times those painful boundaries are what\u2019s needed and best for all involved. Create an environment where those around you are dedicated to purpose and feel comfortable to express how they feel, no matter what it entails (life, love, work), it\u2019s destined to change lives. You think 5th grade is a walk in the park, eh? Well, let\u2019s see if you think so after watching an all-new episode of #AreYouSmarter TONIGHT on @Nickelodeon! https://t.co/hYBf4wHBnM The feeling of anxious fear when breaking the manipulation of comfortably toxic situations is stifling. The good of the unknown is often never chosen for the comfort of toxicity. That first step is the biggest and toughest. Be brave. You can\u2019t finish a race you never start. Dance while the music is playing because eventually every song comes to an end. Comparison is the thief of joy If you\u2019re gonna make it a thing, make sure it\u2019s a thing. You can only make so many things a thing before no thing is worth any thing. Stop making others feel small just to feel bigger. Growth comes from work. Earn the right to grow. Does anyone have a phone \ud83d\udcf1 I can use? I\u2019m trying to use one my cheats for tonight!! An all-new episode of #AreYouSmarter tonight on @nickelodeon! https://t.co/8TeF3IHkbg Hurt people, hurt people. Don\u2019t dump your problems on others. Face them. If someone invites you into their \u201cworld\u201d, and you accept, don\u2019t see their world thru your eyes, see it thru theirs. Lasting bonds are forged thru empathy, respect, trust, and vulnerability. They are as valuable as the precious time spent to build them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d. 2 very important words, no matter how they are delivered. If thrown away, it speaks volumes about the person apologizing. If sincere, they are the critical first step of trying to right a wrong. Never overlook the kindness of others. Kindness many times is the more difficult path to take. Make sure to acknowledge and show gratitude when those around and close to you choose to be kind. RT @JamesGunn: Don\u2019t get too attached. #TheSuicideSquad https://t.co/uITPhrDzz2 It\u2019s September. School is in full swing and I\u2019ve been working hard. I\u2019m studying in this library to see if I could become... Smarter than a 5th Grader! Are you? \nFind out tonight on @Nickelodeon! https://t.co/Mkds6oiWLS Kindness brings kindness out of others. Take the extra steps to be kind in disagreement and have faith that there is kindness in most all of us. Do whatever is needed to rid yourself of those that constantly show hatred and selfishness. Apology is an important step in forgiveness. Sometimes apology is given out of reflex or as an attempt to feel better about actions. Know what you apologize for. Understanding the pain of others will open up connective reconciliation, the opposite just creates more hardship. #NeverForget If you find yourself constantly publicly  \u2018picking apart\u2019 those you privately deem a success, maybe it\u2019s time to just give them credit for what they\u2019ve done and examine yourself. Attraction is what brings us together. Connection keeps us together. Find someone you are strongly attracted to, then be brave enough to allow connection and communication and the result is an unbreakable bond. $100,000 IS ON THE LINE!!! We\u2019re back with TWO all new episodes of #AreYouSmarter TONIGHT at 7p/6c, only on @Nickelodeon! \ud83c\udf4e https://t.co/tU8tP1AlU9 Elbow Grease is a brave truck who never gives up. Follow him and his family in this next exciting story of perseverance and teamwork! Now you can pre-order #ElbowGrease vs. Motozilla, and get a signed copy from me! https://t.co/2Iso8Nn16s The more you are exposed to someone, the more they become who they actually are. There\u2019s so much beauty all around us. Never shy away from an honest critique to help growth, but minimize or eliminate unnecessary negativity. It\u2019s amazing sometimes to see how much of life is lost to issues and people who\u2019s goal is to make us miserable. We all have those people who constantly tell us how poorly we live. Instead of adding to the negative with an argument, honestly evaluate their words. You\u2019ll find most times they belittle you because the are too afraid to belittle a mirror. If you find someone who makes you smile, even when you\u2019re trying to be grumpy, let them into your life. The connection could end up stronger than you ever imagined. Thank you \u2066@vindiesel\u2069 for helping me, challenging me, and openly making me feel part of the #FastAndFurious family #Fast9 What a ride it\u2019s been so far!!!! https://t.co/ycaIquy2le The first week of school has nothing on the first day of babysitting. \n\n\ud83d\udea8Warning\ud83d\udea8: I have NO idea what I\u2019m doing! #PlayingWithFireMovie\n@PlayingWFire https://t.co/HPeaBdso35 Never forget that you have value. Many people will try to manipulate you to either take your value or convince you it doesn\u2019t exist. YOU DO HAVE VALUE. Seek out those who understand and appreciate that. It will be one of the best choices you make. Allow yourself to love. What is under our control is our reaction and response to all that is out of our control. Constantly be a work in progress. Avoiding guilt is very easy. Passing blame to others forces us away from some possibly uncomfortable truths. Own your choices, actions, words. Be accountable for you. A long step away from \u201cdevelopmental system down in Florida.\u201d From the first #NXTArRIVAL on @WWENetwork to a weekly television show on @USA_Network. Congratulations to @WWE and @WWENXT! https://t.co/zJNt5FANBI Empathy, trying to see the world from the lives of others. Many times we rush to aggressively defend, stand up for ourselves, or put others down to feel superior. Take an extra breath, try and see all points of view before you take action. Be remembered because of what you stand for, not what you stand to gain. Wishing all in India \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 #HappyIndependenceDay2019 Having a plan collapse is frustratingly difficult. It happens to us all. Instead of clinging to a collapsed idea, adapt to the now. You\u2019ll save energy, move forward with your life, and overcome the obstacle just put in front of you! \u201cIf you\u2019re the smartest person in the room, you\u2019re in the wrong room\u201d I love this quote and feel it extends past intellect. Try to surround yourself with those who push you. Succeed or fail, you\u2019ll be in a great environment to learn! Everyday we are faced with new challenges. Asking ourselves \u201cwhat is this challenge? What is it\u2019s purpose?\u201d Can be helpful in deciding which challenges we run towards, and those we save for another day. Wishing safety and unforgettable moments to the entire @WWE family for #SummerSlam! Savor every second, there are few things more magical than the @WWEUniverse The importance of doing \u201cnothing\u201d is often overlooked. Just recently we\u2019ve realized how valuable REST really is. Downtime or \u201cplaytime\u201d is the same. Don\u2019t feel guilty about having fun. Life\u2019s easier to deal with when you can laugh and wear a genuine smile. Spend less time worrying about those \u201cbetter\u201d than you and more time investing in bettering yourself. Do the work. Commit to purpose. Constantly evolve. Never give up. Failure is embarrassing, painful, and something most all of us never openly WANT to face. It is also the best way to learn, grow, and define who you are. Be brave enough to admit and face failure, and it may just reward you with the wisdom to achieve your dreams. Fear of the judgement of others is something most all of us have felt. Love who you are and you will find facing that fear is much easier. Over the years my beliefs have changed about many different things. I used to feel sleep was not mandatory. \u201cSleep when you\u2019re dead\u201d, no thanks. I sleep so I can live. Just one of the many things that can evolve. Constantly look within. Know who you are and who you are not. Many times we make everything about ourselves. Our reality revolves around us, but the world\u2019s does not. Handle your business, stay true to your values, be understanding enough to know the actions, choices, lifestyle, success/failure of others has little or nothing to do with you We all strive for certain things, but being jealous of others and attempting to make others jealous is a reflection of our own faults and insecurities. We will always have critics. I\u2019m grateful to all those critical of any choice I\u2019ve made. It encourages me to look within and determine the value of their thoughts. Some have helped me grow tremendously. Others are just a reflection of their own insecurities. Use your time and effort to chase and live your dreams, rather than spending valuable minutes convincing the world that you already do. Insecurities plague all of us. It is hard work to identify them. It\u2019s even harder work to improve on them. You are the sum of the company you keep. Search your last 10 texts. Are they happy? Or hurtful? If hurtful, ask why? Be brave enough to constantly evaluate the company you keep, AS WELL as the person in the mirror. All of us are uniquely different. Try to gravitate towards people that either have or have an understanding of what you value and believe in. Life, work, romance, ect. The \u201cperfect match\u201d is made of those who understand each other and are willing to be brave enough to grow. Searching for, and having friends that blindly agree with your opinions no matter what won\u2019t help you grow. Surround yourself with honest people who challenge your choices, openly can speak about values and beliefs. There is little to learn in always being right. If we feel physically unhealthy, what are we told to do? Change habits, get help, and put effort into change. Try to do the same mentally and spiritually. If you feel unhealthy, change your landscape, your connections, ask for help,  and put effort into those choices to change. The @WWEUsos working that \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a/\ud83d\udd90 #Whoa https://t.co/n4jufipJzp Giving advice is easy and often makes us feel good. Just make sure to speak from a place where you \u201cwalk the talk\u201d. Today is a monumental day personally. Facing and overcoming deep rooted fears, forging ahead with the wonderful journey of life, and being brave enough to share feelings with those I love. Thank you to everyone who has made this moment possible. There is a big difference between aspiring to become better in your own life and despising others for choosing to live how they do. Degrading others takes time away from you focusing on becoming better. There is never anything wrong with being early. You can always \u201cpass the time \u201c but you can never make it up. When wishing those close to you happiness and joy, be genuine. https://t.co/B8CXtvOAGP \nWe all want to be heard but knowledge and wisdom come from listening and application. Be brave, listen and learn from all those around you. @vindiesel @Tyrese @Ludacris @MRodOfficial @JordanaBrewster @missnemmanuel #Fast9 What 3 things can make the toughest, fiercest Smokejumpers panic? A teenager and two small children. Can\u2019t wait for everyone to take this very messy and FUN ride with us! \n\nSo please enjoy the trailer for #PlayingWithFireMovie in theaters this November! \ud83d\udd25 https://t.co/MSWmxF61Al \ud83e\udd2d\n #WorldEmojiDay Be more open minded and less judgmental. If you find yourself continually disappointed in the behavior of those close to you, it may be time to stand in a place where they can\u2019t get close. Be awesome. Make the rest of your life the best of your life. If you feel you have already peaked, you\u2019re right. Grateful for the opportunity, now.... time to #EarnTheDay #Fast9 #Respect https://t.co/jweQQOVcxO Very excited to begin laying the groundwork for a project that combines 2 things I care deeply about. Health and wellness along with those who have served this great nation. Hopefully will have a big announcement in October/November. Embrace the chaos. Find a way. Never give up. Absolutely wonderful. Viaan...ur time is NOW! https://t.co/8Gk64zriU4 Never be afraid to establish boundaries. It allows you to give, and remain you. Both very important. This was filed 3/8/19 months before #WomensWorldCup There is no braver statement than \u2018betting on yourself\u2019. Kudos @USWNT for using sport as their voice to change culture and having the courage to stand up for their values and beliefs.  #Respect https://t.co/TQn0yUHrXb \u201cOur stories are not meant for everyone. Hearing them is a privilege...who has earned the right to hear your story?\u201d Thank you @BreneBrown for more than you\u2019ll ever know.

Use your firework photos to help us #SparkChange\ud83d\udca5\ud83c\udf78#ad21+ #ProudlyAmerican #SKYYVodka https://t.co/KtPO2r7A2w \u201cAm I doing it wrong?\u201d If you\u2019ve never asked this question...... you\u2019re doing it wrong 17 years ago today my @WWE journey began. It is FAR from over and has greatly changed over the years. It has given me chances to be brave and vulnerable. Today #FastAndFurious journey begins. Fear, the unknown, growth, and maybe a haircut await. Adapt. Overcome. Never Give Up. RT @goodhousemag: We've partnered with @JohnCena for a contest honoring YOUR hometown heroes! Nominate a first responder in your life for a\u2026 Many times the things we don\u2019t want to hear are the things we need to hear. Own your everything. Know the difference between those who care about you, and those who care about what you can do for them. If you feel you reached the finish line, it\u2019s time to start another race. All of us have our set of life\u2019s \u201crules\u201d. Constantly revisit them, and know it\u2019s ok if they change. As we change, so should are values. Just don\u2019t let a new you get stuck following old \u201crules\u201d. Never stop dreaming. Chasing those dreams requires an incredible  amount of work. Never give up. I will add the \u201cchop\u201d in the future. What an amazing and surreal few days. @tatis_jr you just may \u201csee\u201d that in @WWE \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f https://t.co/Sh6BssdQR9 A challenge accepted. A wager made.

Sometimes \u201cyou can\u2019t see me\u201d but I\u2019m always closer than you think. Love all of you and thank you for a wonderful evening. Tonight is another chance to be part of something so special #onedollarbet Never had one lesson BUT I learn so much every time I go to the #AreYouSmarter classroom! Check out episodes of @AreYouSmarter weeknights on @Nickelodeon at 7/6pm! https://t.co/gxjrBobEHp Everyday we are presented with situations where we can \u2018choose kindness\u2019. It may not always be possible to be kind, but remember, if you don\u2019t choose kindness, you DO choose the opposite. Own your everything. Our biggest competition is ourselves. Going out to a live audience no matter where, what, and why is always a thrill for me. Leaving \u201cgorilla\u201d for every episode of @AreYouSmarter was an exciting appearance because I got the chance to interact and LEARN from some very smart kids.... tune in tonight! @Nickelodeon https://t.co/7vu61UCGka Oh, I didn\u2019t see you there...I was shopping for antiques. But YOU should tune into @AreYouSmarter TONIGHT on @Nickelodeon! #AreYouSmarter https://t.co/dF8IdWT2cN Oh...did you get my email? I sent you an email. The subject was @areyousmarter premieres TONIGHT on @Nickelodeon at 7/6c! https://t.co/7ENkSuIPq8 The all-new @AreYouSmarter premieres TOMORROW \u2013 get ready to have your MIND. BLOWN. Don\u2019t miss it June 10 at 7/6c on @Nickelodeon! #AreYouSmarter \ud83e\udd2f https://t.co/qLz1AabPPL For nearly 20 years, the Fast Franchise has entertained fans and created some of the biggest cinematic moments in history. It\u2019s an incredible honor to join this franchise and this family. https://t.co/7GFzDsX8sl Never forget all those who embarked on the great crusade, 75 years ago today #DDay75 https://t.co/NKwZUUMvYq The worst feeling in the world is to feel used and lied to by someone you trusted. That\u2019s happened to us all. Don\u2019t close yourself off to trust, or love. If you never give \u2018trust\u2019 or \u2018love\u2019. You will never get trust or love in return. Your happiness does not require the consent of others. Be happy. Stay tough. \nHappy Birthday, Diego. https://t.co/RYmipzsUfd An awesome first day at @BookExpoAmerica. \nConversation with the educators, library owners, and those who work with young readers all centered around a growth mindset. Excited to see everyone tomorrow to continue our discussion and meet more of you who play this important role. https://t.co/jLrDHhJ7a9 It\u2019s amazing sometimes the situations we can become comfortable with. Talking ourselves into comfortable complacency. Be brave, if you want or need a change, make it. Thinking too long will just keep you right where you are. Opportunity is never a hand out. It is a chance. It\u2019s a chance to work harder than you already do. Welcome opportunity, and thru those chances you will succeed, fail, but most importantly gain wisdom and forge a a better you! Never forget all those who\u2019ve made the ultimate sacrifice for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Earn each day. #MemorialDay https://t.co/WNti0GyhPa I can\u2019t get this elephant\u2019s voice out of my head. Literally. Because it\u2019s mine. I guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m always eating pistachios. @WonderfulNuts https://t.co/uKmeOfIvKF Never underestimate the power of an act of kindness. In a day and age of trying to share everything with everyone, find the someone who makes you feel like everyone else disappears. Listen to a preview of the #ElbowGrease audiobook, now available narrated by yours truly and complete with sound effects! Find out more via @PRHAudio: https://t.co/KT7grkzIb5 https://t.co/INUP8Zdh7L Best part of the all-new @AreYouSmarter? THE CLASS. They're an amazing group of young men and women who I guarantee will teach us all a thing or two! Can't wait for you to meet them all June 10 on @Nickelodeon! #AreYouSmarter https://t.co/5N5HpK8U3x True Story: It took 10 days to record Ernie\u2019s voice. Nine of them were wasted because THIS elephant wouldn\u2019t stop munching pistachios in the booth. @WonderfulNuts https://t.co/VTetQV7DrP In a day and age of filters and showcasing only \u201cperfect moments\u201d, never lose the real you. In trying to be liked by everyone, don\u2019t become no one. We all struggle. Don\u2019t feel you need to struggle alone. Asking for help is not weakness. It can make a world of difference. Life is a state of constant motion. Whether that motion is forward or backwards is up to the one living the life. Kindness is a wonderful example of tolerance and acceptance for the existence of those around us. It\u2019s also something we directly control. Some life changing moments for me, first time I picked up \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, first @WWE match, first @MakeAWish and THIS WEEKEND. @fit_ops Tears, smiles, honor, bravery, connection, and purpose among other things! Can\u2019t have \u2018life changers\u2019 without LIFE. I love you Mom. #HappyMothersDay There are certain moments in life that answer questions of purpose and assure us that we are where we need to be. This week, especially now, has been just that. Thank you to all involved in such a life changing series of events. Truth can be an interesting thing. Because we all view it thru our own lens. We are often quick to judge the truth of others, from a lens that is not theirs, yet hesitate and ignore the action and truth of our own. Own your everything. Believe in others who help you to believe in yourself. \nWhen the task is difficult, the triumph is greater.\nAbsolutely and incredibly proud to be partnering with @performixdriven and @Fit_Ops to help those who've served our nation. \n#EarnedNeverGiven #KeepPerfecting #FitOps https://t.co/ZwTCkEHvi9 It\u2019s very easy to shift blame for our own mistakes. Own your everything Beware those who think you owe them happiness at the expense of your own well being. Very excited to say that I have received an invite to what I believe will be an event that will change my life. I\u2019m certain I will cry my eyes out and simultaneously harness the power of a lightning bolt! You know who you are, see you soon, and thank you. Just finished such an amazing experience where I was surrounded by a great group of gifted young people that made me a better human being! Learned SO much!!!! Thank you classmates!! Silence can often be our most valuable asset, for many, it\u2019s also the most difficult to use. Emotions never get the best of us, emotions are us. Be accountable for your emotions and actions. Own your everything. The term \u201ceasier said than done\u201d is 100% true. Doing of the deed is the hard part, it\u2019s just a matter of if you\u2019re willing to \u201cwalk the talk\u201d, because it\u2019s much easier said, than done. Own your everything. Never give up. Thank you, Kurt. \n\nWork as hard as you can. Constantly surround yourself with those better than you. Make mistakes and learn from them. Never give up! (Ankle lock is an exception, it\u2019s true!) @RealKurtAngle \n\nhttps://t.co/Q3jLcWnP6B Opportunity can arise when we least expect it. Always presenting itself with a chance, but normally accompanied with fear and sacrifice. Face those fears, make that sacrifice, get uncomfortable and seize those opportunites! Win or lose, you will learn from every one!! ..and never give up! No matter what you chase, it is NOT easy, even when you enjoy it! Because we all have good and bad days, embrace the good and fight like hell thru the bad. Never give up. 30 years. Straight. And I\u2019m just getting warmed up! Own Your Everything! https://t.co/4s0CtcpPaD ..30 years of overcoming failures, literally facing the man in the mirror, and knowing that growth will come thru pain and discomfort, and never giving up. Find your passion. The thing you can do for 30 years and hope for 30 more. And chase it. With the \u201cbest you\u201d everyday.... https://t.co/s9lkx5KMd4 ...I found my passion for fitness by beginning a dedicated workout/nutrition program at (yes this is correct \ud83d\ude33) age 12.

WE ARE THE SUM OF OUR ACTIONS. 42 is usually a forgettable # but it\u2019s special for me......... https://t.co/CpAsDgbGYj You are the one responsible for your pain and joy. Own your everything. I was super nervous and had many moments of doubt, but thank you @TheEllenShow and your amazing audience and guests for giving me a chance to face my fears and be part of such a wonderful experience! Unforgettable! https://t.co/YxiFPEaSij Over the years, @TheEllenShow has given me the wonderful gift of friendship.

Greek god of wine making... yeah that\u2019s a good one for me @bts_bighit @BTS_twt #BTS The power and emotion of sport is amazing.  #TheMasters There will be those who voice their opinions about your choices. Always consider the source before you let it affect you. More often than not they have little business evaluating your life, and are just looking for attention or a reaction. Both would be a waste of your time. Strive to have friends that will help you face truth and give you priceless honesty in uncomfortable times. Thank you to everyone out there who does this for me. Means everything. You know who you are. Thank you. Instead of trying to find the right person, try to be the right person. Get to a point where you love yourself, and you might be surprised at the company you choose to keep. Happy #Wrestlemania35 day!! @WWE @WWEUniverse Hang on to things you love as long as you possibly can, also understand the cycle of life. Everything has an end. Hanging on past the end can lead to many trying and challenging moments Surprise! Congratulations and THANK YOU for the years of entertainment, smiles, laughs, and of course, wine. Looking forward to the next \u201cevolution!\u201d @KathieLGifford #CheerstoKLG https://t.co/avka6adTbZ One chapter ends, another begins, the story never stops. Own your everything. Never Give Up. We all have times of fear, guilt, and anxiety. All of us. A special message from Agent Burns: #BumblebeeMovie is now on Blu-ray! https://t.co/OghGsgxKoN \ud83d\udc1d https://t.co/M3T4KTCvgK Never Give Up. Congrats Colin, your hard work starts now!! Good luck man!! https://t.co/IcgMi83vXX Search for someone you connect so strongly with, that you miss them the moment they are gone. Be present, live and love the now. \u2018You never know what you got, until it\u2019s gone\u2019 leads to some difficult reflection. Know what you have while you have it. Find joy from the ups, downs, beginning, middle and end. That way memories are fond, not regretful. Opportunity does not happen everyday. When it does it will ALWAYS involve tough choices, hard work, and sacrifice. When opportunity does knock, ANSWER! And then be prepared to give your best! When searching for someone to make you smile and feel good inside, be sure the first person who does that is the one looking back at you in the mirror. Never fear losing something you don\u2019t possess Attitude is a boomerang, what ever you throw out there, it will come back your way. Allow life to happen. If you stop giving reasons things shouldn\u2019t happen, you\u2019ll be amazed at what does happen. Love, without effort, is not enough to keep any relationship together There are many who work behind the scenes to make @WWE the massive brand it is, but few have touched so many lives like Sue. Congratulations to a person who has made dreams come true and has given hope to families around the world. #WWEHOF #WarriorAward https://t.co/BviKEz0iig In the toughest of times we face the toughest of choices. Whenever possible, choose love. I have often talked about being the sum of the company we keep. @RealJohnCMartin is a close friend who has been on an amazing journey of development and dedicates his life to lifting the spirts of others. Love you John. Grateful to have you in my life. https://t.co/ojBtuWrC8k Congrats on an unbelievable achievement! Hard work, great attitude and passion pay off! Good luck!! https://t.co/wRGr07jZu5 Improvement is never easy, or comfortable. Strive to improve, always. Don\u2019t normally do this but this is a well written piece that speaks volumes to the wonderfully gifted and hard working current @WWE roster! What an amazing time to be a member of the @WWEUniverse https://t.co/xb0IdqcZBQ It might not always be possible, but each day try to do a good thing for someone with expecting nothing in return. Posting again just to make sure all can access. Cried tears of joy and smiled ear to ear learning about \u201cRoz\u2019s\u201d story. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I do. https://t.co/WeWop6bBHk Well done \u2066@theCHIVE\u2069 what a special young lady \u201cRoz\u201d is. Good people doing things for good people. Amazing story and hope everyone has the time to watch this. You will smile and cry with joy. https://t.co/abpGpxeqc8 When trying a new skill, a point of failure will be reached very quickly. Don\u2019t give up. Especially if you enjoy it. Press on though the tough times! What can be accomplished with persistence is amazing! Never give up. A new day, a new week. Filled with challenge, opportunity, connection, setback, good, bad, and all in between. Own your all. Earn the day. And when times do get tough, Never give up. Confidence in ability, hard work, and persistence through the difficult times is a major factor that determines long term victory from defeat. Love lacks logic. That\u2019s why I love it. Can\u2019t wait! You are an inspiration to me and it will be an honor! You embody #NeverGiveUp #onedollarbet https://t.co/25ZSS5hpsO No one is irreplaceable. Strive to be unforgettable. Do your best to be your best. Sometimes those close to you will disagree with your choices. Know the difference between those who are trying to help you grow, and those who are trying to bring you down. Own your everything. I\u2019m sitting at a picnic table now BUT will be at @StrandBookStore in Union Square, NYC on April 5th at 4pm taking photos and meeting fans of #ElbowGrease! \ud83d\ude97\nUntil then, I\u2019ll just be sitting at this picnic table. https://t.co/h1X95Cqg4c Stay humble. Stay hungry. Own your everything. Bad decisions are a part of life. We all make them. Own those actions instead of manipulating the situation to avoid feeling guilt or shame. Projecting shame or guilt onto others is just another bad decision. Perception sometimes clouds us from the obvious. Emotions can blur logic, even when it meets us eye to eye. We often talk ourselves into a perception other than the obvious to cater to our needs, but if it looks like knife, has a blade, and cuts, chances are it\u2019s a knife. We are defined by our actions. Telling someone something and then doing the opposite makes the words meaningless. Being a \u201cperson of their word\u201d simply means saying something and doing what you say. A very simple, yet admirable quality to strive for. Success is a vehicle for people to become who they really are. The ride up is never as fast as the ride down. Work hard. Never give up. Always be accountable for your actions. Own your everything. I am grateful enough to have, only a few, but a few real friends in my life that will be honest with me if I\u2019ve made some sort of mistake, then help me work to correct it, and do not take umbrage when the tables are turned. You know who you are. Love you. Thank you. Real superheroes exist. Back and with strength and purpose! It\u2019s your yard Roman. Your time is most certainly NOW! https://t.co/jEBDtQm39W This was very motivating to wake up to. Never too late to strive for greatness. \u201cRing the Bell\u201d is an honored tradition \u2066@HardNocksSouth\u2069 when you achieve what seems to be impossible. Thanks to the entire \u2066@FordhamBaseball\u2069 squad! #NeverGiveUp https://t.co/8fGsMAsx7r Taking stock of your surroundings shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Things, times, and people change. Not to mention changes we may go thru. Never be afraid to take a step back, evaluate yourself, your choices, your goals, and your relationships as it pertains to your being and joy Speaking tells people what we know. Listening allows us to learn. Keep perspective on when to use each one. RT @VinceMcMahon: .@WWERomanReigns (aka Joe Anoa'i) will address the status of his fight with leukemia this Monday on Raw. #fighter #proud\u2026 In trying to be everywhere at once to do everything, just make sure not to end up nowhere doing nothing at all. Own your life choices, both the good and bad. Own your everything. Passion for something can be productive. Obsession with something may be the opposite. They say \u201cwisdom comes with age,\u201d but you should never doubt how intelligent young men and women can be. Ready to bring back this educational and FUN show. It\u2019s time to find out... #AreYouSmarter?! @Nickelodeon https://t.co/JSn7kwt2DT I know #ValentinesDay has very mixed reviews. But celebrating love, that certainly IS special. Love is a powerful, wonderful thing that evokes all your emotions and shouldn\u2019t be contained to 1 day. Never fear telling those you love \u201cI love you\u201d today IS a good day to start RT @randomhousekids: In @JohnCena's second picture book Elbow Grease is back and about to face off against the gnarly monster machine Motoz\u2026 All my life I've been privileged to be a part of many great \"teams.\" If I'm in a @WWE ring, on set, or spending time with loved ones, who I am is shaped by the wonderful people beside me. These experiences have helped to create a very special project ... #ElbowGreasevsMotozilla! https://t.co/hWRkFBluVp Everyone that comes into your life is either a blessing or a lesson. Define what you\u2019d like to achieve. Work each day towards that goal. Know who you are, and embrace every bit of it. Always strive to evolve, just never be anything but yourself. Deny someone what they really want, observe them through hard ship, or give them power... and you will find out what the true nature of their character really is. We all have our perception of truth. This becomes our reality. In times of emotional stress don\u2019t cloud truth too much with unfair bias. Do your best to look at life for what it is, so you can take the steps to make it what you think it should be. Always take ownership of mistakes. Lessons can be learned from even the smallest of things, like proofreading or knowing the difference between \u201cyour\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re\u201d. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude09 Thanks to all out there keeping me accountable. Live. Learn. Love life. If your going to gamble, bet on yourself. Brave chances backed up by constant effort, can lead to amazing things. My apologies to all the real football fans out there \u26bd\ufe0f! Hope everyone enjoys the @NFL version of #WrestleMania #SuperBowlLlll and make sure to check out @WWE #HalftimeHeat during halftime! Enjoy Hoping everyone enjoys the #WrestleMania of football. Happy #SuperBowlSunday Compare yourself to yourself. Time spent trying to be like someone or be someone else may take focus away from who you really are. \u201cAm I better than I was yesterday, last month, last year?\u201d \u201cAm I moving forward towards my life goals?\u201d Never stop asking. Never stop learning. No one is perfect. When looking in the mirror, own your flaws, and shortcomings. Know you are strong enough to work on them, learn from them, grow from them. The more often you can look within and take ownership of both good and bad, the better potential for growth and joy. We always will give ourselves reasons for not facing difficult challenges in life, the base of many of those reasons is fear. Fear of what will happen to us if we try. If we try, we will learn, grow, fail, succeed, feel, and live. If we don\u2019t, we will always simply just wonder. Violation of trust is difficult. Faith is put into an idea with the belief that all parties will be honest. When it fails it can lead to feelings of being used, manipulated, betrayed, ect. Never fight that \ud83d\udd25 with \ud83d\udd25 It\u2019s better to have trust broken, than to be on the other side Control the controllable. If you are going thru a rough patch due to the actions of others, ask yourself, what things under your control can be changed. You can\u2019t make someone be anything but themselves, but you can control how you handle what life throws your way. It\u2019s harder and harder to keep secrets these days...excited we get to share this news today!! @netflix https://t.co/LxTFOlHrED Setbacks are a large part of life. People often say \u201cwhat a bad time to get hurt\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t believe this happened to me now\u201d ask yourself, is there a good time to get hurt? Or be setback? Setbacks are just another chance to find triumph! Never give up! Sometimes we hide honesty because we think it will be hurtful to those who would hear. I don\u2019t understand this.  Lying is always more hurtful than truth. Be empathetic and honest but have the difficult conversation. We all want someone or something to blame when things don\u2019t go our way. Try taking that blame. Face your setbacks and fears head on, learn from them, and make a stronger, smarter, and better you! Working on every part of #BumblebeeMovie was great because I believed in the cast, the crew, &amp; most importantly, the STORY of the film. Excited to see how well the audience in China and throughout the WORLD have taken to the story of \ud83d\udc1d! \nXie Xie Zhongguo! https://t.co/vVvfR62F6Q Do the people you surround yourself with encourage you, or burden you? We tend to take on the traits of those we spend the most time with. Do your best to find an environment of encouragement and growth. Being upset by the happiness of others seems like wasted time. We should all strive to be happy, and if someone else\u2019s happiness is hurtful to you, look within, ask why, and hopefully you\u2019ll not only find answers, but maybe find happiness yourself Never fear the moments where all appears lost. It only is if you allow it. Focus, regroup, move onward. (Even if at first you must move slightly backwards \ud83e\udd2b) Committing to a purpose means doing everything you\u2019ve ever heard about hard work. Long days, sacrifices, dedication to cause. But if it\u2019s purpose with passion and love, it will never seem like \u201cwork\u201d It\u2019s very disappointing when those you have opened up to attempt to use your vulnerability as weakness to make you feel pain, guilt or shame. Stay strong, be empathetic, but also understand the situation and move forward accordingly. I used gravity boots for the first time yesterday. Turned my whole world upside down. Passion, purpose, and love. Fill your existence with these three things, and I\u2019m willing to wager you have many more good days than you do bad ones. Reflection. Prediction. Resolution. Awareness. Mixed in with some plain old living! #HappyNewYears #Happy2019 Wishing all out there a safe and happy #NewYearsEve2018 What\u2019s up w the HAIR?! @WWE I\u2019ve tried to tell you!

It\u2019s grip is always the strongest when it comes from those you hold close. Do your best to address those difficult moments. If they continue, maybe don\u2019t hold those people so close. Nothing of any personal value is ever given away. It is earned.

It\u2019s time for another episode of Brightly Storytime, our read-aloud video series for kids. Get your engines\u2026 Do not hold onto a poor decision just because you spent lots of time to make it. Taking an honest look at yourself should be done often and means coming to grips with some great, and some difficult things. Being able to move forward and improve after you genuinely identify the difficult and the great, can lead to immeasurable growth. For those out there who find themselves saying \u201cI just want to be happy\u201d remember to ask yourself what it is that makes you \u201chappy\u201d. Many have no idea, they just want \u201chappiness\u201d. Do your best to define it, then make choices to work towards it. The phrases \u201cI love you\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d, and \u201cI forgive you\u201d are extremely powerful when said with genuine meaning. If wasted and simply said without truth, they are equally powerful but in the most negative way imaginable. Take accountability for your actions and choices. Know that not everyone will see your point of view. If you offend anyone, apologize and ask for forgiveness. The \u201cunknown\u201d is a wild place because it is what is says. Many times our fear keeps us from experiencing the \u201cunknown\u201d. Be brave, know that difficulty and uncertainty lie ahead, and don\u2019t let your fears keep you from what could be your greatest moments Thank you for letting me and all the characters from #ElbowGrease spend Friday evening with you! https://t.co/XxczSYDoua https://t.co/bmVVhqJ3kt Don\u2019t give up on something you enjoy just because of the pressure from others around you. Your life is yours to live and you only get one. Make sure to try and enjoy it! Tonight is a special night not only for women in @WWE, but every person who\u2019s ever been a fan of our industry. Congratulations to all participating, I\u2019m excited to watch tonight as a fan. #WWEEvolution https://t.co/veSIr4wawz Have you heard the legend of Patty Kayake?

But more often than we think, our limits are self-imposed\u201d Angela Duckworth It is very difficult to face those who cause you pain and ask for sympathy.

There is much more to be learned from failure than from victory yet with most victory is discussed and failure is privatized. Try the reverse, you may learn something new. \u2018Courage - strength in the face of pain or grief.\u2019 You have given us your everything including a courageously vulnerable moment. We, your WWE family, give you all of our love and support. #ThankYouRoman #NeverGiveUp Believe in what you say, and what you do. If you say and do things just to create an image of what you want people to think, over time they will eventually see who you really are. If you give your absolute all to something, no matter the result, you should be at peace knowing you couldn\u2019t work any harder. Hearing hurtful things from those you hold close is difficult. Some are trying to help by being brave enough to give you truth, others are just plain hurtful to cover their insecurities. Be humble and aware enough to know the difference. The best part of #ElbowGrease has been seeing how much everyone is enjoying it with their loved ones. Excited to be in Boston on 10/26 to continue the fun! https://t.co/nsD1JTz3KO A truly surreal moment....#ElbowGrease is a @nytimes #1 Best Seller! Thank you to everyone who made this a reality.

Life has points where it\u2019s not easy. Many times it feels like you against the world, but you never have to go it alone. Ask for help, work hard, get a good group around you and the tough times will pass. Preparing for an exciting week that\u2019ll take me around the world. Excited to see the @WWE Universe in Australia at #WWESSD and then sign copies of my new book #ElbowGrease in NYC and Philly next week! https://t.co/h3XKhSzpoi Celebrating #NameYourCarDay with Bumblebee!

My first car name\u2026 https://t.co/k9w2obp7xt \u95ea\u7535\u62f3\u5934 \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a 10/6 #WWESSD @WWE @WWEUniverse #RAW #SDLive https://t.co/uclK15AOjf The words \u201cnon negotiable\u201d automatically kill a situation. Anything can be negotiated it takes knowing your needs, listening to the needs of others, and coming up with a resolve that all feel is fair. Ive always enjoyed this quote \u201cPerhaps the feelings that we experience when we are in love represent a normal state. Being in love shows a person who he should be.\u201d Anton Chekhov \u2018This person would be perfect IF\u2019 is simply an attempt to change and control people. This is a waste of precious time. Focus on you and honestly ask yourself \u2018do the people around me know and love me for me?\u2019 If the answer is yes, you\u2019re around the right folks! \ud83d\ude0a Fear is what prevents us from being ourselves because of how we think others might view our choices. It will always be there. Strength comes from being brave enough to face fear, recognize it, and overcome it to let YOU shine through! I am guilty of this myself but I\u2019m changing my view now. Hard work and persistence are needed for success, but so is rest and recovery. Busy periods of time will come, but never sell short recharging yourself. I\u2019m NOT on \u201cthe grind 24/7\u201d because rest is more productive. Nothing lasts forever. When doing something you love make sure to be present and enjoy it. That way if and when it ends, you can look back with fond memories instead of regret. RT @bumblebeemovie: This Christmas, every hero has a beginning. Watch the new #BumblebeeMovie trailer now, and \ud83d\udc9b this Tweet to receive spec\u2026 Do good work. Stay true to your values and what you believe in. Be patient. Know that you will fail. Get back up. Be accountable for your actions. Embrace the uncomfortable. Never give up. Some people face change. Some people change face. Opportunity never presents itself when your \u201cready\u201d, so just be \u201cready\u201d to be uncomfortable and take chances. It\u2019s easy to stay comfortable and play safe. See the opportunity, embrace the fear, take the chance. You never know. It\u2019s human nature to judge, especially in today\u2019s culture of sharing everything, but instead of categorizing someone based on a post or an image, get to know them and the way they live their life. Your opinion will be much more accurate and less negative. Weakness IS a strength. With so many worried about being perfect, vulnerability and showing weakness is the absolute key to growth. Yes you will have a tough road but opening up is one of the best ways to learn about life. Being ridiculed, judged, and belittled is unfortunately commonplace whenever you decide to face your fears, but when it comes from those who are supposed to care about you ask yourself if they really do? 10/6 #WWESSD \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a @WWE #RAW @WWEUniverse @WWENetwork #SDLive \u95ea\u7535\u62f3\u5934 https://t.co/20gi7H3Ni4 The great thing about social connection is it gives us all a voice. It also allows us to easily see those that squander that gift by choosing to use that voice for negativity. Asking for help is a wonderful process that accomplishes many great things. Realize you don\u2019t know everything, trust those you ask to help you develop, and learn more about who you are and what you value most. Happiness is achieved by living your life, your way. Others may not agree with your actions or choices, remember its YOUR life, not theirs. Go forth, live, be happy. What better place to learn about #ElbowGrease than in a place I work very hard in every week! Excited for you all to read it! https://t.co/Xqu3w12lts https://t.co/ougvR1t5fr The only person you need to prove yourself to is you. 10/6 \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a @WWE  #WWESSD We are the creators of our own reality. With that power comes the responsibility to be accountable for the reality we create. Do not expect others to share your viewpoint. Our lives are made up our actions and choices. Don\u2019t ever expect everyone to just \u2018see things your way\u2019. Be accountable for you, explain your actions the best you can, and if people still don\u2019t understand, allow them that choice. Many of us fear rejection. Rejection is simply a difference in opinion. Next time you get rejected, instead of feeling embarrassed or afraid, ask \u201cwhy?\u201d It\u2019s amazing what can be learned about yourself and others. Love what you do. If you don\u2019t, and can\u2019t suddenly quit. Find out what it is that you love and take steps everyday to move towards that. Love what you do. It\u2019s the easiest way to do great work!! So many times we hang on past experiences or spin our wheels about what\u2019s to come that we fail to live in, and enjoy the NOW. Memories and foresight are special, but never downplay the \u201cnow\u201d. It is the place where we make memories and dreams come true. You cannot expect someone to share your goals when they do not understand and share your values. What a wonderful night in \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 @WWE @WWEUniverse thank you so so much for allowing to perform at #WWEShanghai already back at @EyeOfJackieChan set for more \ud83c\udfa5 Thank you #JCStuntTeam for teaching me the art of Ba ji quan! \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a #TheDoomiest Almost time. \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a @WWE 6thMOD #TheDoomiest https://t.co/OV02oi3aPX Well done @SD_Southpaw ! \ud83d\udcb5 #OneDollarBet this is a bet I really hope to lose! #NeverGiveUp https://t.co/gzE6ejHxRk &gt;4 Days \ud83d\udc4a\u26a1\ufe0f @WWE \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 6thMOD.. aka #TheDoomiest https://t.co/G2qmWiQowP So excited for everyone to read #ElbowGrease and for the chance to meet YOU @BNUnionSquareNY in New York City on October 9th and @FreeLibrary in Philadelphia, PA on October 12th! https://t.co/R9P2wq28Cd https://t.co/FGrIF6s3Q1 Love yourself. There will always be hatred. Striving to be better is wonderful but ALWAYS #LoveYourself . And know the difference between self love and self absorption. One will help you, one will not. Failing to meet expectations can lead to some tough emotional territory. That\u2019s why giving your all to something is important. If for some reason your expectations aren\u2019t met or you don\u2019t meet that of others, yes it\u2019s tough, but little else could be done. We are in a culture of sharing, and of critique. Be comfortable with you. Critics will always attack your achievements or failures with heartless ferocity. Use the negativity to make you a stronger, better you. Keep doing. Keep sharing. The time and place you want to be on Saturday, October 6th?\n#WWESSD LIVE from Melbourne, Australia @MCG\n#PrepareForThe6thMove\n@WWENetwork https://t.co/BLG1NadEAK \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a @WWE #WWEShanghai https://t.co/w1R4ejawDb If you thought you couldn\u2019t C me in a @WWE ring, get ready to do a #DoubleTake \u2014 premiering on Facebook Watch September 5th! https://t.co/xA91AI0CqN Life changes are often met with critics and hatred. Those who think they know you will say you\u2019ve let them down. Those who really know you will encourage your attempt to grow. #EmbraceTheUncomfortable #RiseAboveHate #NeverGiveUp I have the utmost respect for anyone who can operate at a high capacity amidst adversity. Being constantly reminded of all the reasons you will fail, and still always rising to the occasion shows true dedication and passion. It\u2019s now always about who ... it\u2019s about what. #ElbowGrease is a story of hard work and trying your best. ANYONE can do it. Pre-order now: https://t.co/Xqu3w1jWS2 https://t.co/Az1OHqXH7f First time in 15 years I have not been able to be a part of @WWE #SummerSlam. I am beyond grateful to @EyeOfJackieChan but truly miss the @WWEUniverse. Wishing all Superstars luck and safety! My time isn\u2019t quite up, but #YourTimeIsNow! #CarpeDiem True thank you to @EyeOfJackieChan #JCStuntTeam here in \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf3 for getting me ready for 9/1 @WWE #WWEShanghai we do have shirts on but you can\u2019t see them \ud83e\udd2d 9/1 ... day of the \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a #6thMoveOfDoom https://t.co/xGVoiZzw8u Know your values and beliefs. Communicate them to those you love. Getting to the roots of what you value and believe is both a foundation to fix wrongs and a key to happiness. Life will be filled with failure, especially for the brave who put themselves out there. When failure happens, look first at yourself, because this is all you can really control. Assume the burden, build yourself stronger, and be ready for the next challenge! To all of India #HappyIndependenceDay2018 No one has it all figured out. \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a @WWE 9/1 #WWEShanghai Honesty is the foundation of unlocking your potential. We often try to project image an that we are \u201cperfect\u201d. No one is. Honesty with self and those around us allow us a chance to improve ourselves and our surroundings. Trying to be \u201cperfect\u201d is just a version of dishonesty. You are the sum of your actions, not your words. You do NOT want to throw a beer at a robot. Ever. See the first episode of #DallasAndRobo streaming now on YouTube! https://t.co/iToj0JokbM https://t.co/QgXty4ohL5 The promises you make mean nothing compared to those you keep. Be vulnerable. It shows you for you. People will judge, disagree, and downright despise. But you will be you. Most of those who judge, disagree, or despise do so because they struggle with vulnerability themselves. Never stay in your \u201ccomfort zone\u201d too long.

Routine allows for many comforts and conveniences, but can prevent you from learning valuable things about you. Do something different, or something you always wanted to. \u201cI see no hope for the future of our people if they are dependent on the frivolous youth of today, for certainly all youth are reckless beyond words.\u201d Hesiod 8th century B.C. Just because youth is often misunderstood doesn\u2019t mean the future isn\u2019t bright! Trust is a powerful thing. \u201cdon\u2019t trust anyone\u201d closes the door on the experience of life. Learn to trust people, good and bad can come of this, but the more you trust, the more you get to know people for who they really are. The 6th move of doom. \nReady for #WWEShanghai.\nSept 1st. People will speak about you. People will try to speak for you. People aren\u2019t you. YOUR voice is the most powerful when it comes to your values and beliefs. Always be accountable for your voice, and sometimes the best use of it, is silence. #BetterThanSexIn3Words Love. (You can have the other 2 words, I feel all we need is love \ud83d\ude09) \u201cWant to change the world? Find someone to help you through life.\u201d William McRaven. So grateful to each and every special person who has, is, and continues to help me through life. I always promise to give my best #NeverGiveUp and #EarnTheDay Never fear trying, but never be blind to the lessons of failure If you can learn something from your experiences, good and bad, you will live with little to no regret. In times of crisis you find out who is your friend and who isn\u2019t. Anyone who supports or praises you in triumph then abandons or ridicules you in crisis isn\u2019t worth giving your time to.

Instead, look inward and work to be the best you possible. #NeverGiveUp Congrats to the global phenomenon that is @BTS_twt your journey and success are inspiring and impressive! #BBAMs #NeverGiveUp https://t.co/FRMgEGA2dE We tend to have long lists of why we \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d do something. I am a fan of logic, but fortune favors the bold\ud83d\ude0a It\u2019s easy to talk ourselves out of something. Instead, go give it a try!! Robo kicks @$$! Want to see what we have in common? Check out the brand new @YouTube Red series #DallasAndRobo! Premieres on May 30th! https://t.co/WNHfcPQSn4 https://t.co/n9OnZON3ts Please @BTS_twt forgive my inexperience with the language, but here is my answer https://t.co/YFeO6TqyLG https://t.co/07IztsuBvc We all have an internal voice. Listening to IT instead of the many voices around us can be a path to happiness. Listen to your \u201cheart\u201d everyone else, is often just confusing noise. Lack of communication is many times what causes people to drift apart, lack of forgiveness is many times what causes people to stay apart. If at first you don\u2019t succeed, try try again  #IVoteBTSBBMAs #NeverGiveUp Better late than never!!#iVoteBTSBBMAs\ufe0f https://t.co/091lZ3AjlD So.. my #TuesdayThoughts .. to \ud83c\udf77 or not to \ud83c\udf77? Boozeday Tuesday on @klgandhoda @TODAYshow ! Very happy to join @klgandhoda on @TODAYshow this morn! Could use a bit of \ud83c\udf77 to take the edge off \ud83e\udd2b\ud83d\ude09 Thank you Mom, for always caring, worrying, protecting, teaching, and loving me. I love you #HappyMothersDay Try never to make a decision when you are tired, hungry, or angry. We all have a story and we all want to be heard, but it\u2019s amazing what can be learned if you take a moment and listen to those around you. Some of us long for things until we get them, then feel still unsatisfied. Being driven is great. Not knowing thyself, not so great. Action has consequence. An extra second of thought can help you see the action, and consequence. \u201cA game of chess is like a sword fight, you must think first, before you move.\u201d Learn from your mistakes. A life of regret is a life unfulfilled. What is that you say? Yearning for an animated buddy-comedy with cowboy hats in OUTER SPACE? Very excited to bring this @YouTube Red Original Series #DallasandRobo to the ENTIRE UNIVERSE on #May30!  \nhttps://t.co/qoWYQXUB1A https://t.co/h0G6zWKQ7y If you choose to keep moving, no matter how low the road takes you, it will eventually begin to climb back up. #NeverGiveUp 240kg pause. #MayThe4th #MayThe4thBeWithYou @starwars https://t.co/qOjjED8KUc The @FloElite guys fired me up, so here\u2019s a 600lb \u201cclean grip\u201d deadlift.

No one is perfect, but if you happen to do something to make someone feel bad, TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY for your actions, APOLOGIZE, and ASK FORGIVENESS. Spring is upon us, love is in the air. Nothing is more romantic than prom night...right? @BlockersMovie https://t.co/0IKPu5maJV https://t.co/37oo5E07Px Life is funny sometimes.
