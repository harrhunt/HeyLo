Love you guys \u2665\ufe0f We\u2019ve been heard. Remember that is is a movement, not a moment. Keep fighting the good fight. #BlackLivesMatter We asked the \u201claw enforcement officers\u201d in the area we protested in yesterday to take a knee &amp; join us before we left for curfew &amp; ONE cop out of the 50+ that I saw with my own eyes knelt. Statistically speaking, NINETY EIGHT % of the cops there are against a positive change?? Good morning \u2665\ufe0f Another day another difference to make!! Be heard!! #BlackLivesMatter Officers on ego trips, a journey to nowhere. \n\nJoin the black lives matter movement, a journey to a better world. https://t.co/vz5zvpCf75 We are not silencing ourselves today, but instead posting about WHAT TRULY MATTER and that ONLY. \n\nSPEAK ABOUT THE MOVEMENT. USE YOUR VOICE AND BE HEARD! #BlackOutTuesday #BlackLivesMatter https://t.co/UW5QSFXsoO We are releasing our weekly podcast episode early this week because we WILL NOT be silent.

We are too powerful. Your voices are heard, keep using them. #BlackLivesMatter Wow https://t.co/IGT2GX4slJ @TobyTurner @SongRepeater It\u2019s not anti white, it\u2019s a hopeful step towards anti hate.. and all my tweets do well, thank you This isn\u2019t directed at ALL white people, but MANY, too many, need to learn and understand. White people need to drop their ego right now and learn. They need to open their mind and look at what\u2019s going on in front of them. Living with racist beliefs is NOT a right or an option. We NEED change. Our generation can do it. We WILL do it. @Wakeheart #BlackLivesMatter \u2665\ufe0f I could not be more proud of our incredible youth. We are utilizing every accessible platform to speak selflessly on a subject that matters above all else. Together we MUST make a change and stand for what we all know is right.

I love you guys and I can\u2019t wait to share this documentary with you all I was driving around by myself this morning and happily broke down. Filming this documentary has been very emotionally galvanizing. I\u2019ve had the hardest time feeling anything this past year, but it truly brought out emotions in me that I feared would be gone forever. https://t.co/rD08PWg2a7 @lovegrayson2019 \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f love you If I could help just ONE single person who is feeling the way I\u2019m feeling right now, I\u2019d feel fulfilled. This subject is not talked about enough. There are NO wrong and right ways to grieve. Damn I just really don\u2019t anyone to feel alone. Ethan and I are creating and directing a documentary for our Dad right now. We\u2019re going to be open to show what this is really like. What it\u2019s like to lose someone so close to you.

Dig deep, stay strong, and do it for yourself! You should always recognize how important you are to YOU. Change bad habits, be a good person, find something positive to focus on and don\u2019t lose hope. You will make it out with a genuine smile on your face Mental health is a very serious issue.  When you feel like you\u2019re at your lowest it may seem like there\u2019s no point of life, or that you don\u2019t matter, none of which is actually true. It may take a lot of time to escape those awful feelings and thoughts but you are strong enough - Breaks my heart to see Pete Davidson feeling like this :( Hold on and stay tough man, the reason may not seem clear right now but life will come around for you.

It was actually fun tho not gonna lie \ud83d\ude36 @RyanAbe Love you! I believe in myself again \u2665\ufe0f The goal doesn\u2019t involve any material item, or status level. To me, it is more important than anything you can touch or have. I set a goal for myself that is very special to me a few years ago. From then until now I kinda lost the focus &amp; motivation to accomplishing it because I was too busy trying to find myself. But now I am awakened. I am finally back on the track that I started on. I\u2019m gonna do this I\u2019m so excited https://t.co/kzHlKUqbzj @JoeyGraceffa @TeenChoiceFOX @EthanDolan \ud83d\ude0a\u2665\ufe0f FINALLY! hahah the bonus video is up everyone! \n\nhttps://t.co/e1LNb0J5qf\n\nIf it gets a lot of likes we\u2019ll probably do more bonus videos \ud83d\ude0a lolol At this SLOW ASS rate the video will be up at 2 PST \ud83d\ude2d im so pressed Yo sorry guys our video got all messed up idk why.

I feel such good energy surrounding me and I\u2019m ready for life \ud83d\ude0a I love when the sun goes down at Coachella so no one can see me when I dance because I def look like a fkn dumbass Ethan asked me to go in the gas station and get him snacks but I refused because of his vicious attitude and he went in and only got snacks for himself. What a mans!!!! Do people really think I won\u2019t hear what they say behind my back? I forgot how stressful putting together Coachella outfits was I actually take the derpiest selfies fking ever Happy national siblings day to my sister Cameron \u2665\ufe0f love ya I just realized how weird it is that there is someone else that looks exactly like me just walking around and stuff I opened Twitter 27 times today to tweet and I couldn\u2019t think of anything good to say... uhhh fettuccine alfredo... It\u2019s weird how you can learn endless things about yourself. Like I\u2019m me... how do I not know everything about me? Crazy how much life changes when you have the right people around you in the right setting \ud83d\ude0a Meaning that I have only swam while nude thus far I have yet to NOT skinny dip in our new pool Ethan and I just got our first house together.

Everyone reading this, you are perfect. F**k societies ideal look, height, weight, color, etc. You don\u2019t have to be anything for anybody. If you need help with something, ask! \nIf someone asks for help, help! To everyone pulling April fools pranks today so it\u2019s not too obvious... it\u2019s still obvious Being organized is the hardest thing for me Me and Ethan are bestfriends again. Not that we ever weren\u2019t we just are again. I feel so motivated and inspired! I encourage everyone to start new things, meet new people, and just keep an open positive mind. Look for signs. Life will treat you well if you have a positive outlook! New beginnings. I\u2019m so excited.

Some people REALLY don\u2019t care about you and only care about what you can give them. I\u2019ll never understand that.. Back in Jersey for a little \ud83d\ude0a I missed my family and friends so much Life has been so confusing lately. Idk if I\u2019m ever gonna figure it out lol THANK YOU FOR 6M \u2665\ufe0f My head is still swollen and I still look like a freak lol I REALLY need to change my layout lol. I need to change like allll of my prof pics tbh Happy Spring I usually don\u2019t tweet about doing stuff like that because I don\u2019t do it to tweet about it but that really just made my day \ud83d\ude0a I just gave goldfish to a homeless man and he started smiling and dancing.

Guys these tats are for everyone in this fandom. We are a family. Let\u2019s act like it. You guys are permanently in m.... uhhh I mean like in my skin not like i...\n\nhttps://t.co/AwQYMt8bKq\n\nThank you to everyone who participated in this video I appreciate you very much. \n\nThis is for ALL of you \u2665\ufe0f 20 mins \ud83d\ude0a Good morning!

Hahaha it\u2019s gonna take a full day to open all of this stuff but I\u2019m hype it feels like Christmas \ud83d\ude0a I guess it\u2019s just hard being a teenager. After doing the same thing every week for 3 years you start to question yourself a lot. By no means do we want to stop making videos every week we just need some change in our lives. We\u2019re feeling really reinspired now and the vibe in the air is so much better. It\u2019s funny how well you guys know us. I\u2019ve seen a lot of comments on our recent video saying that our videos seem too forced and that we\u2019re uninterested in the stuff we do now. Me and e were feeling kind of stuck creatively for a while but a lot has changed in the past week. LIMITED EDISH MERCH DROPPING FRIDAY LIFE IS WEIRD My car is broken down and I\u2019m stuck af right now love this THIS WEEK\u2019S VIDEO IS UP!! \n\nhttps://t.co/MczeECDOcF\n\n\ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa\ud83e\udd1a\ud83e\udd22\u2708\ufe0f\ud83d\udc26\ud83d\udc14\n\nThose emojis will make sense after you watch it hahaha Happy Tuesday \ud83d\ude0a Me and Ethan just picked up thousands of packages at the post office.

People have lost loved ones, idols, hero\u2019s, fans to suicide. Filming a video and mocking a victim is not raising suicide awareness. Laughing at the body of a poor depressed soul. I can\u2019t believe the disrespect of the victim, their family, and your YOUNG fans. I\u2019m not gonna stay silent I\u2019m gonna stand up for what\u2019s right right now My # 1 goal for 2018 is to start having more fun on social media again.
