It fills us with such joy &amp; peace knowing that they just wanted to be kind to two random foreigners (plus our guide) without seeking anything in return. So we went into the home of this beautiful and warm family who had absolutely no idea who we were and yet they treated us with such warmth and love. We spent some time with them chatting and drinking tea and the whole time they just know us as two tired trekkers ! Today, during our 8.5 km uphill trek we stopped by a small village on a mountain to pet and feed a baby calf who was born just 4 months ago. While we did that the owner of the house asked us if we were tired and wanted to have a cup of tea ? https://t.co/44sQxD0EiB Happy birthday Shah!
