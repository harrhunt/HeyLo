This project had been formally reported, on several occasions, to the Club\u2019s Board of Directors. It has also been concluded from @PwC that the value of the services covered by the contracted project was within a market price range. The conclusions of the audit report of the firm @PwC are that in the hiring by the Club of various services related to the monitoring and analysis of networks, no defamatory campaign was commissioned against anyone, and there was no corrupt conduct. \ud83c\udf81 19 assists, 19 passes that have led to goals \u26bd\n\ud83d\udc10 #Messi, the assist king in @LaLigaEN! \ud83d\udd14 LAST CALL!

A few weeks later, his performance in the Gamper against Juventus was praised all around the planet \ud83d\ude0d \nThe rest\u2026 is history \ud83d\udc10 https://t.co/M963GJYorC In 2004/05 he alternated between Bar\u00e7a B and the first team. He made his competitive debut against Espanyol and scored his first goal against Albacete at the Camp Nou \u2728\u26bd https://t.co/nXZzxLJA2h That same season he also started playing for Bar\u00e7a C and Bar\u00e7a B, making 37 official appearances and scoring 35 goals. He also won the league with the U18B team and played for the \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 U20 national team\ud83d\udc4f https://t.co/h7ZK7edF6W \ud83d\udd25 Then in the 2003/04 season, Leo played for as many as 5\u20e3 teams.\nHe started with U18B, but quickly got called up to U18A and when he was still only 16, Rijkaard gave him his senior debut in a friendly against Mourinho's FC Porto https://t.co/vdm4g79Uyi \ud83c\udfc6\ud83c\udfc6 The team won the league and Copa Catalunya!\nIn the final, Messi had a broken cheekbone and had to play with protection, but took it off after 7 minutes because he couldn't breathe properly. He'd scored twice by half-time and Bar\u00e7a eventually beat Espanyol 4-1 \ud83d\ude4c https://t.co/xZ7bPtOE0J The following year with the U16A team, Messi scored 38 goals in 31 games, including nine braces and four hat-tricks and once he scored four times! But it wasn't just the goals. It was the kind of goals and, most of all, the way he played \ud83d\ude0d https://t.co/VmojGE69i1 \ud83d\udcaa It took him months to recover from the injury, but the following season he trained with the U14A team, and quickly earned promotion to the U16B team coached by Tito Vilanova\nHe faced another months-long wait due to red tape, but eventually played 10 games and scored 9 goals \ud83d\udd25 https://t.co/aOfVjbLoPG But Messi made his debut with the U14B team. Bar\u00e7a won 3-0 at Amposta and he scored one of the goals \u26bd\nBut things took a nasty turn in his second game. He fractured his fibula and missed the rest of the season \ud83e\udd15 https://t.co/uBoYlUXkHV \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf7 \u2708 Leo was only 12 when he came to Bar\u00e7a from Argentina, and although he trained with the U14A team, there was red tape to sort out before he could make his debut.

He still holds the Club's single-game scoring record in @LaLigaEN, from when he found the net seven (7) times in a 9-0 Bar\u00e7a win over @RealSporting in 1952.\n\nBut, how many titles did he win with Bar\u00e7a?\n\n(6/10) \u2195\ufe0f https://t.co/a2W2ZGFPlm Kubala stood out for his sheer physical strength. He was incredibly gifted with his feet, boasted extraordinary field vision, was a free-kick master, and was a highly respected leader on the field.\n\n(5/10) \u2195\ufe0f https://t.co/Ylo6XBbRvv Bar\u00e7a's dominance could have been even greater if it had not been for the unsuccessful effort to sign Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano in 1953, which kept the team from bringing together to the two greatest stars of the era.\n\n(4/10) \u2195\ufe0f https://t.co/HUsVbLKmcm Although Kubala signed with Bar\u00e7a in June of 1950, he didn't make his official debut until April of 1951 due to bureaucratic red tape.\n\nHis arrival ushered in a golden age for Bar\u00e7a, helping the team win everything, including the Five Cups from 1951-1953.\n\n(3/10) \u2195\ufe0f https://t.co/qckuqFH0Jz Born of Slovakian parents in Budapest, Hungary, Kubala caught the interest of Josep Samitier, Bar\u00e7a's Technical Secretary at the time, during a tour of Spain by the Hungary national team, founded by Kubala and other players who were refugees from Eastern countries.\n\n(2/10) \u2195\ufe0f https://t.co/YbpJ6LAX9t Born #OnThisDay, 93 years ago, he is considered one of the great legends in Bar\u00e7a history. He was a global reference point in the world of football in the 1950s.
