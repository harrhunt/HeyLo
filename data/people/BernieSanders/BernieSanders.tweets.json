{"tweets": "Last year, 1 out of 5 Americans could not afford the medicine prescribed by their doctors. Meanwhile, over the course of the pandemic, the pharmaceutical industry has increased the price of more than 500 prescription drugs. That is the sort of greed we have got to stop. I do not think in the year 2021 that we should continue to accept a reality which sees women paid just $0.82 for every $1 men are paid for doing the same job. I believe we can achieve economic justice in this country \u2014 that means equal pay for equal work. #EqualPayDay RT @CoriBush: A little over a year ago, I spoke at Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign rally in St. Louis.\n\nToday, we co-introduced our first pieces o\u2026 I hope you'll join me, @onefairwage and tipped wage workers from around the country tomorrow night at 8:00 PM ET as we discuss the fight to end starvation wages.\n\nWhat questions do you have for us when it comes to raising the tipped minimum wage in this country? https://t.co/dE7gR078kl Over the last 23 years, drug companies spent $7.6 billion on lobbyists.\n\nSince 1990, they contributed more than $700 million to candidates.\n\nNow the industry charges us the highest prices in the world for prescriptions.\n\nCongress must summon the courage NOW to take them on. I am proud to support the New Deal for CUNY campaign calling on New York state to tax the rich and make CUNY tuition-free for poor and working-class students. \n\nTogether, we will make this a reality at public colleges and universities across America. https://t.co/mQeqkgdSUv Congratulations to nurses in Wisconsin who stood together, demanded the dignity they deserve and won! https://t.co/PU4wsfGecC Space travel is an exciting idea, but right now we need to focus on Earth and create a progressive tax system so that children don't go hungry, people are not homeless and all Americans have healthcare. The level of inequality in America is obscene and a threat to our democracy. https://t.co/CbMWYnPFUx CEO pay growth from 1979-2019: 1,167%\nWorker pay growth from 1979-2019: 13.7%\n\nMaybe it's a radical idea, but I think it's time we created an economy that looks out for the working people of this country, and not just the CEOs. Every benefit, from the minimum wage to the 5-day work week, was earned when people organized. It\u2019s never easy. But workers at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama are standing together right now and if they win, it will send a shockwave throughout this country. https://t.co/4JVvXAPHfJ Tens of millions of Americans are out of work. Half our people are living paycheck to paycheck. \n\nBut hey, a handful of billionaires have another $1.3 trillion in wealth, so that's okay, right? WRONG.\n\nEnough is enough. We have got to create an economy that works for all of us. Right now, women make up 70% of tipped workers, yet they experience 3x the poverty rate as the rest of the workforce. That is an outrage.\n\nPlease join me and @onefairwage next Wednesday at 8 PM ET for a conversation with tipped workers on raising the tipped minimum wage. https://t.co/vtiY0CXlGg The average worker in America is now making $32 dollars a week less than he or she made 48 years ago \u2013 after adjusting for inflation. That is absurd. We are in a moment in American history where two guys \u2014 Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos \u2014 own more wealth than the bottom 40% of people in this country. That level of greed and inequality is not only immoral. It is unsustainable. When we talk about rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, we must include low-income and affordable housing. Today, 500,000 Americans are homeless, and 18 million spend 50% of their incomes on shelter. We can create millions of jobs building the housing we desperately need. What will the $1,400 direct payments in the American Rescue Plan mean for you and your family? I happen to think that at the end of the day, to deliver for working people, we have got to end the filibuster. https://t.co/WrsYSd5jXZ I stand with nurses in Madison, Wisconsin who are demanding a safe work environment and paid sick leave. They are on the frontlines in our fight against COVID-19.  We must treat them like the heroes they are. https://t.co/fMtNc36Od2 Let me be clear, we must have the courage to address the crises facing the American people, even if it means taking on the big money interests. Yes, we are off to a really good start. But we must continue to stand up for the working class. https://t.co/qZIoZYPI5n Shock of shocks! After historic voter turnout, the GOP is trying to restrict who can and cannot vote. Cowardly politicians who can only win elections by suppressing the vote need to get out of politics and find a new job. https://t.co/RPgCx6zcxx The American Rescue Plan is the most consequential piece of legislation for working families passed in many decades, and that is because it begins to address, in rather significant ways, the enormous and unprecedented crises they are facing today. https://t.co/khgC0Ul7uf I say to Jeff Bezos, the richest person on the planet: what is your problem with Amazon workers organizing for better working conditions and better pay? You are worth $182 BILLION. You cannot continue to have it all when so many are struggling. https://t.co/2Iqglogg2u We cannot and will not have a moral society when so few have so much and so many have so little. That is the struggle we are engaged in. We must continue to fight for an economy that works for all of us. One year ago, Breonna Taylor was murdered by police officers. It is a disgrace that we are still waiting on justice. The time is long overdue for us to combat systemic racism and a broken criminal justice system. The American Rescue Plan more than doubles funding for community health centers, which means that more working families all over this country will be able to walk into a community health center and get the care they need. That will be transformative for so many. It\u2019s unfortunate Mr. Bezos won\u2019t join our hearing. While he\u2019s become $78 billion richer during the pandemic, families are struggling to survive, so why is he spending a whole lot of money to stop workers from organizing a union at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama? https://t.co/haeBDYHxaz While Senate Republicans told us we cannot afford to provide $1,400 direct payments to the working class, they had no problem introducing a bill this week to repeal the estate tax which would provide a $1.7 trillion tax break to the billionaire class. Total hypocrisy! The American Rescue Plan will\n- send $1,400 direct payments to working class adults &amp; their kids\n- cut child poverty in HALF\n- boost unemployment payments by $300\nThat is just some of what's in the bill. What a difference it makes when government is on the side of working people. This relief bill is the difference between dignity and despair for millions of America\u2019s working families. And yet, not a single Republican \u2014 the so-called 'party of the working class' \u2014 voted for it! The Republicans have turned their backs on the needs of working families. https://t.co/K4lzs3sUjw The Senate must now take up the #PROAct. The trade union movement is the last line of defense against a billionaire class that won\u2019t be satisfied until they have it all. https://t.co/CST7gM13kS The $1,400 direct payments in the American Rescue Plan will mean the difference between despair and dignity for millions of people in our country. Finally, our government is responding to the pain of working people. Interesting. The Republican Party claims to be the party of the working class. Yet, according to a recent Pew poll, 63% of lower-income Republicans support the covid relief bill that we just passed - but not one Republican voted for it. They sure LOVE working people. No doubt. To the progressive movement, it is because of your support that we just passed the most significant legislation for working people in decades. Let\u2019s talk about just a few of the policies in it. https://t.co/6q0VFlp2oc Under GOP control, Congress passed $1.9 trillion in tax cuts mainly for billionaires &amp; corporations. \nNow, after one of the highest voter turnouts in history, we passed $1.9 trillion to help working families who are struggling.\nDo not let anyone tell you your vote doesn't matter. What we did is write and pass a bill to address the crises facing the American people, not the wealthy and large corporations. The result is the most significant piece of legislation to benefit the working class in many years. https://t.co/wP91Qe3Mds The American Rescue Plan addresses a crisis that America has ignored for too long: Our childhood poverty rate is among the highest of any major country on Earth. Yes, we are finally going to provide real help for the children of America. https://t.co/q7fYDINnmI In 2017, Republicans passed a tax bill that provides 83% of the benefits to the top 1% &amp; tried taking healthcare away from 32 million people. On Saturday, Democrats voted to provide 86% of Americans with direct payments &amp; cash benefits to 93% of kids. Elections have consequences. Right-wing Republicans in CA are trying to recall @GavinNewsom for the crime of telling people to wear masks and for listening to scientists during COVID. Extremist Republicans have done enough to undermine democracy already. We must all unite to oppose the recall in California. Today, 56 years on from Bloody Sunday, it is absurd that we are still fighting for the right to vote. Not only is it our duty to keep fighting to end voter suppression in all its forms \u2014 we must also work to expand our democracy and make it easier for all our people to vote. The American Rescue Plan is the most significant piece of legislation to benefit working people in the modern history of this country. https://t.co/bRcOAqJwKG Where was Republicans' concern for the deficit when they gave over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the rich and large corporations? The bill we are fighting for right now is the most significant piece of legislation for working families that Congress has passed in decades. https://t.co/knwAzjYwOn In my mind, the great economic crisis that we face today is half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. And many millions of workers are, frankly, working for starvation wages. Raising the minimum wage is what the American people want, and it's what we have got to do. There is not one state in our country where you can make ends meet on the current federal minimum wage. Not one! How quickly would Congress raise the minimum wage if they were forced to live on $7.25 an hour? Outrageous. There is nowhere \u2014 I repeat, NOWHERE \u2014 in the United States where a full-time worker being paid the federal minimum wage of $7.25 can make ends meet. That is a disgrace. It is far past time that we raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and give millions of workers a raise. Of the 32 MILLION workers who would benefit from raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour:\n- 59% are women\n- 31% are Black\n- 26% are Latino\nThis is not just about economic justice \u2014 raising the minimum wage would significantly narrow the gender and racial pay gap. Let's do it. 40 years ago today, I won my first election to become Mayor of Burlington by just 10 votes. 10 votes. Do not ever let anyone convince you of the notion that your vote does not matter. Your vote matters and we need you to stay involved in the political process. https://t.co/KnmVtyvAh0 RT @janeosanders: On this day, March 3rd, @BernieSanders won his first Mayoral election by 10 votes. https://t.co/WoWx76nFZL I say to the Walton family of Walmart: the American people are sick and tired of subsidizing your greed. Pay your workers a living wage. https://t.co/fO15Fv08wD Why should the taxpayers, many of whom are struggling economically as a result of the pandemic, subsidize the starvation wages being paid at Walmart? The owners of Walmart got $50 BILLION richer during the pandemic. They can afford to pay workers a living wage. At a time when millions of workers are earning starvation wages, when the minimum wage has not been raised by Congress since 2007 and stands at a pathetic $7.25 an hour, it is time to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. https://t.co/DftFAaESey Sadly, the Republican Party has turned its back on democracy and evolved into an authoritarian party \u2013 suppressing the vote, pushing big lies and conspiracy theories. Too many Americans have fought and died to defend our democratic way of life. We cannot and will not fail them. Walmart, the largest employer in America, is owned by the richest family in America. Their wealth has gone up $50 billion during the pandemic, and they spend millions on themselves. But the company they own starts workers off at $11 an hour. That is outrageous. https://t.co/NbKkuZjz5a I strongly disagree with the parliamentarian\u2019s ruling about the minimum wage. But the people are demanding an end to starvation wages in America. We will not give up. We must get this done. https://t.co/qt6mYJU7fl The relief bill is life and death for millions of working families. I\u2019m LIVE with @PplsAction to talk about how we get it done. https://t.co/LLhMkEgHsC RT @JuanForRep: I am inspired daily by how Congresswoman @AyannaPressley represents her communities w/ moral clarity in Congress &amp; am deepl\u2026 Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour would benefit 32 million workers and would give low-wage workers an extra $3,300 a year.\n\nI'll say that again.\u00a0Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour would benefit 32 MILLION workers. Let's get it done. The owners of Walmart, the Walton Family, are the richest family in the country. They're worth $200 billion. They currently pay at least HALF their workers less than $15 an hour. That is absurd. The richest family in America can afford to pay their workers a living wage. https://t.co/Yw7bAJBBUp RT @PplsAction: We need #COVIDReliefNow!! \n\nJoin our member orgs @LUCHA_AZ &amp; @citizenactionny Feb. 25th @ 8PM EST for a discussion w/ Senat\u2026 Let me congratulate the workers at Amazon for having the incredible courage to stand up and to fight for a union. The fight you are waging will send a message to workers all across the country that if they stand up, stand together, and fight, they can win. https://t.co/7cG5v6elCb Some people \u2014 including Senators \u2014 say, \"Well, Bernie, how can we afford to act on climate change?\u201d The real question is: how can we afford NOT to act while climate change causes destruction and suffering? We have a moral obligation to protect the planet for future generations. I\u2019m proud to support @gilcedillo\u2019s campaign for reelection to the City Council. He knows that working people built Los Angeles, and he fights every day to make sure their voices are heard over the concerns of the wealthy and the powerful. https://t.co/HsehsIM4zV Cowardly Republicans, afraid of democracy, want to make it harder for people to participate in the political process. What are they afraid of? Our job is to make it easier to vote, increase voter turnout and strengthen our democracy. Together, we will end voter suppression. https://t.co/HVxr7Rldg6 No one can tell me that you\u00a0can live in dignity on $7.25 an hour. It cannot be done. It is time we\u00a0finally do what is right, and raise the federal minimum wage to a living wage of $15 an hour. No more starvation wages!\u00a0https://t.co/0mGwm1TiYH I\u2019m endorsing @JuanForRep for state representative because when he gets to the state house he will put the working people of the 19th district before the needs of special interests and the wealthy. https://t.co/jiRoLJfCDo This is the height of corporate greed. The owners of Kroger choose to shut down stores instead of simply paying the workers risking their lives who make their corporate profits possible. Absolutely despicable.\n\nhttps://t.co/oFjbKuuTMM When the gap between the very rich &amp; everyone else is widening; when the 50 richest Americans own more wealth than the bottom half of our country; when the effective tax rate of billionaires is less than that of average workers; YES. We must address income &amp; wealth inequality. Raising the minimum wage is not just about economic justice \u2013 it is about racial justice. Nearly half of Black and Latino workers in America make under $15 an hour. We must end starvation wages, and give 32 million Americans a raise by increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The overwhelming majority of the American people understand that we must end starvation wages in America. That means raising the minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour by 2025.\u00a0Period. https://t.co/Pxh3QbXNG8 Let's be clear. The rich are doing just fine. Billionaires are seeing tremendous growth in their wealth. But working families are living in more desperation than at any time since the Great Depression. Congress has got to move forward vigorously, and help the American people. https://t.co/TU6vyW4OVD Instead of spending billions on 30 second tv ads, Democrats must invest in 12 months a year grassroots organizing around the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice. If we build a political movement from the ground on up, we cannot lose. I stand in strong solidarity with fast food workers all over this country who are going on strike today to demand $15 an hour and a union. The Senate must raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour with 51 votes this year. We have got to end the crisis of starvation wages in America. Does the Republican Party believe in democracy or the Big Lie and conspiracy theories? That is what Republicans must decide. That is what is at stake. https://t.co/Mx3M1U4Qaz The Covid relief bill when passed is going to do a lot of good for working Americans, but one thing that simply cannot be emphasized enough is that it will cut child poverty IN HALF \u2013 the biggest reduction in modern history. That's why we must act and act quickly. The impeachment trial was not just about Trump's speech on January 6. It was about whether we remain a democracy or move toward authoritarianism: big lies, racism, divisiveness, violence and one-man rule. That's what the trial was about and that's what 43 Republicans voted for. Thank you @USProgressives for your leadership. The Covid Bill in the House increases stimulus checks to $2000 for the working class, raises the minimum wage to $15 an hour, cuts childhood poverty in half and extends unemployment benefits. The Senate must prepare to act quickly. It is not acceptable that in America today the very rich get much richer, while working families struggle. No more austerity economics. We need an economy that works for all, not just the few. https://t.co/bkMBq5V758 It is truly sad and dangerous that only 7 Republicans voted to convict a president who is promoting a Big Lie, conspiracy theories and violence, and is aggressively trying to destroy American democracy. This is what the Big Lie is all about. Three months after the election, and 61 court decisions later, Trump and his attorneys still refuse to acknowledge that he lost the election. Pathetic. This is about greed \u2013 plain and simple. Closing down Minor League teams, like the Vermont Lake Monsters, is a disaster for baseball fans, workers, and communities across the country. I will do all I can to fight it. https://t.co/4FC6E2k0si Millions of Americans are trying to survive on starvation wages. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. Inequality is growing. It is a moral imperative to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. We must act NOW. https://t.co/mrdStdnNjD Maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 instead of listening to the billionaire class we should pass the relief the American people are demanding and desperately need. That\u2019s what Democrats promised, and that\u2019s exactly what we must do. Let's get it done. https://t.co/5o43Jg900S It's time to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. https://t.co/BlvQ52unvn The Republican Party has a fundamental choice to make. It can be a conservative party that believes in democracy and the rule of law or it can be an authoritarian party that\u2019s built on conspiracy theories, violence and the Big Lie. But it cannot be both. While the top hedge fund managers made $23 billion in 2020, millions of people struggled to put food on the table for their children and pay their rent. \n\nIt\u2019s time to rethink our national priorities and finally build an economy that works for all \u2013 not just the billionaires. https://t.co/xjWXmjPeOK Congratulations to the House Leadership and the Progressive Caucus. It is absurd to create an income eligibility cap that would mean 40 million Americans who got support under Trump wouldn\u2019t get checks under Biden. Let\u2019s get this done. \nhttps://t.co/7T9obKuWr4 I stand in solidarity with Amazon workers in Alabama who are today beginning to vote in a historic union election. \n\nIf they win, it will not only improve wages and working conditions in Bessemer, but it will also send a shockwave around the country.\nhttps://t.co/namvkT16zx Jane and I are deeply saddened by the passing of Karen Lewis. She lived her life on the front line of the struggle for justice in education, and to honor her memory we must recommit ourselves to building the fairer future students and families deserve. https://t.co/wmWb35VQCt Let's be clear. We will never get 10 votes from Senate Republicans to pass a $15 an hour minimum wage.\u00a0The ONLY way we can do it now\u00a0with 51 votes is through the reconciliation process. It is absurd that some Democrats think we should tell a worker making $52,000 a year that they are \"too rich\" and cannot get the full $2000 benefit we promised. It makes no sense to me, nor do I think it makes sense to the American people. https://t.co/aksYr44pI7 RT @CNNSotu: LIVE: @BernieSanders joins @jaketapper on #CNNSOTU. Hope you join us! https://t.co/EU9K5NhHz0 It cannot be overstated how powerful it will be if Amazon workers in Alabama vote to form a union. They are taking on powerful anti-union forces in a strong anti-union state, but their victory will benefit every worker in America. I\u2019m proud to stand with them. https://t.co/3JtUeAzJOY RT @AOC: It would be outrageous if we ran on giving more relief and ended up doing the opposite.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that this is even an argument in\u2026 Unbelievable. There are some Dems who want to lower the income eligibility for direct payments from $75,000 to $50,000 for individuals, and $150,000 to $100,000 for couples.\u00a0In other words, working class people who got checks from Trump would not get them from Biden.\u00a0Brilliant!

Walton family wealth in 2018: $146 billion\nWalton family wealth in 2021: $228 billion\n\nWalmart minimum wage in 2018: $11 an hour\nWalmart minimum wage in 2021: $11 an hour\n\nIt is a moral outrage that the richest family in America pays workers at Walmart starvation wages. The budget resolution the Senate passed today puts us on a path to finally raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. It is a moral imperative in the richest country in the world that no one is forced to live on a starvation wage, and the American Rescue Plan will get it done. The agenda of the budget resolution passed today is not the agenda of wealthy campaign contributors. It is not the agenda of the billionaire class. It is the agenda of the working people of America and with its passage we are closer to restoring their faith in our government. Not only is the $1.9 trillion emergency COVID-19 relief package the right thing to do from a moral and policy perspective, it is precisely what the overwhelming majority of Americans want us to do.\n\nLet's deliver real relief to working people everywhere. Let's get this done. Tonight, I will be on the Senate floor to get a budget framework for COVID-19 relief passed. \n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, will be offering countless amendments to delay and disrupt this process.\n\nWe will not be deterred. We will get this done and deliver real relief. No one can tell me that you can live in dignity on $7.25 an hour. It's time to raise the minimum wage to $15.

These unprecedented crises demand unprecedented action. Today is the last full day of the worst and most dangerous president in American history.  \n\nFor four years Trump has tried to divide our people up.\n\nOur job, now, is to bring people together around an agenda that works for all, not just the few. \"When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism and militarism are incapable of being conquered.\u201d -Martin Luther King, Jr. \u201cThis country has socialism for the rich, rugged individualism for the poor.\" -Martin Luther King, Jr. The Keystone pipeline is &amp; always has been a disaster.

In this unprecedented moment, the new Democratic majority must show that we can walk and chew bubble gum at the same time.\u00a0Yes. We must impeach Trump. Yes. We must process Biden's nominees. Yes. We must pass legislation that addresses the enormous crises facing working families. Let's make it permanent by ending Citizens United, abolishing super PACs, getting big money out of politics, and moving to the public funding of elections. https://t.co/XNYVzD1xxw Let's be clear. If Trump is too dangerous to send out a tweet or a Facebook post, he's too dangerous to be commander-in-chief. Donald Trump must be removed from office immediately and held accountable for his horrific acts of sedition, violence and chaos. President-elect Biden is absolutely right. $600 is not enough for working class Americans who are struggling to pay the rent and feed their families.

It must be made clear that no president, now or in the future, can lead an insurrection against the U.S. government. Now that Democrats have power, we have to be bold in a way we have not seen since FDR in the 1930s. \n\nThe first order of business: A new COVID relief bill with $2,000 payments for every working class adult. https://t.co/1jHtqg33nN A number of Administration officials are resigning in protest to Trump\u2019s horrific acts of sedition yesterday. Not good enough! The Vice President and cabinet members must invoke the 25th amendment NOW and remove Trump from office before he incites more violence and chaos. The man directly responsible for the chaos of today is Donald Trump, who has made it clear that he will do anything to remain in power \u2013 including insurrection and inciting violence. Trump will go down in history as the worst and most dangerous president in history.

We win when we build a multiracial, multigenerational coalition. We win when we make clear we\u2019re on the side of the working class. With Democrats in control of the Senate, we must keep faith with the working families of this country. Promises made must be kept. That means not only the $2,000 direct payment, but an aggressive agenda that recognizes the economic desperation facing so many Americans.

At a time when so many people are facing economic desperation, the $600 direct payment is a step forward \u2013 but it's not enough. We need to increase that direct payment to $2000. Biden wants it, Trump wants it, Pelosi wants it, Schumer wants it. Now, Congress must vote to do it. Along with Vice President-elect @KamalaHarris and Sen. @EdMarkey, I've been fighting for months to get Congress to pass a $2,000 direct payment for the working class. The House must pass this legislation tomorrow and the Senate must quickly follow suit. Let's get this done \u2013 NOW! Sign the bill, President Trump. https://t.co/Dk71W6awLk In this dangerous moment \u2013 COVID, oligarchy, economic desperation, climate change, a dysfunctional health care system, systemic racism, etc. \u2013 we must continue fighting for a political revolution and transformative change.\u00a0Nothing less than the\u00a0future of the world is at stake. Congress must pass $2,000 in direct payments and Trump must sign the COVID-relief bill. If not, tens of millions of Americans will lose their unemployment benefits, go hungry and face eviction. This would be a level of governmental cruelty not seen in our lifetimes. That's great! I first introduced a bill to provide a $2,000 direct payment with @SenKamalaHarris &amp; @EdMarkey 7 months ago. Now, Mr. President, get Mitch McConnell and your Republican friends to stop opposing it and we can provide working class Americans with $2,000. Let's do it. https://t.co/fKvqBsqM0k Good politics: Over the past decade, every Medicare for All co-sponsor up for re-election beat their Republican opponent \u2013 every single one.\n\nGood policy: Medicare for All would save 68,000 lives and cost $650 billion LESS than our current dysfunctional healthcare system a year. Joe Biden is absolutely right. During the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, working families desperately need more direct payments to pay the rent and put food on the table. The $2,400 in direct payments that will be sent to a family of 4 is a start, but much more is needed. https://t.co/vrzx5Gjuyi Republicans &amp; some conservative Democrats thought that a $1,200 survival check for the working class was too costly. But they had no problem giving the bloated Pentagon $740 billion for weapons &amp; war.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, it's time to fundamentally rethink our national priorities. We fought very hard to make vaccines for COVID-19 free for every man, woman &amp; child in America. Now, we must make certain that no health insurance company, pharmacy or medical provider is able to charge the uninsured or under-insured any type of fee before they get the vaccine. I wanted $1200 in direct payments. We got $600.\n\nWill that help? Yes, it will.\n\nIs it enough? No, it is not. https://t.co/FuFSpcWgbc While Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans refused to provide adequate relief for working families facing economic desperation, they had no problem giving a $5 billion, 100% tax deduction to CEOs for a 3-martini lunch. You got it. The GOP loves corporate socialism for the rich. Maybe \u2013 just maybe \u2013 it\u2019s time Congress listened to the American people and sent $1,200 survival checks to working class Americans who are in so much desperation right now. https://t.co/UvUSIbNX71 Never forget. The same \"centrists\" who tell us we cannot afford to give the working class and seniors a direct payment to pay the rent and feed their families during a pandemic, all voted to give the bloated Pentagon a record $740 billion without \"paying for it.\" Unacceptable! We need $1200 direct payments for every working class adult and $500 for each of their kids NOW. https://t.co/FdU3zudvcX RT @ossoff: David Perdue opposes $1200 relief checks for Georgians. \n\nLet\u2019s make sure every Georgia voter hears the Senator\u2019s message loud\u2026 Sen.

I will not support Manchin-Romney in its current form. We must fight together to improve it. While the COVID crisis is the worst it has ever been, Manchin-Romney not only provides no direct payments, it does nothing to address the healthcare crisis and provides totally inadequate assistance for the most vulnerable.

These are unprecedented times and Congress and the Biden administration must respond in an unprecedented way.\n\nIf we are going to restore faith in the American political system, we must act boldly. https://t.co/yNJqw9W0RR The pandemic is surging and will get worse in coming months. Meanwhile, Trump raises tens of millions by undermining democracy and telling his supporters the election was \"fraudulent.\" This is the most dangerous president in American history. Bye-bye. I'm fighting for an agenda that works for workers \u2013 not the 1%. \n\nYES to raising the minimum wage to $15/hr. \n\nNO to tax breaks for the rich. \n\nYES to creating millions of good jobs through a Green New Deal. \n\nNO to billions in corporate welfare for big oil companies. Today, a worker must earn $23.96 an hour to afford a modest 2 bedroom apartment \u2013 $5.74 more than the average tenant makes. As a result, 18 million families are paying over 50% of their income on housing. We need to raise wages and build 10 million units of affordable housing. Despite an explosion in technology &amp; a huge increase in productivity, the average U.S. worker is making $30 a week less today than she/he made 47 years ago after adjusting for inflation. Meanwhile, the top 1% has become $22 trillion richer since 1990. Yes. We need a wealth tax. If Congress does not get its act together soon, up to 87 million workers will lose the paid sick and family leave they desperately need. We must expand these benefits to all workers. No worker should have to make the unacceptable choice of going to work sick or losing a paycheck. https://t.co/DYNAgAHAfS Thomas Piketty is right. At a time when the very rich are becoming much richer while working families are facing economic devastation, we need to address the obscene level of income and wealth inequality. We need to tax the extreme wealth of multi-millionaires and billionaires. https://t.co/SMz6K6KUST I am proud to support Jon @Ossoff, along with @ReverendWarnock, for the U.S. Senate in the Georgia runoff election. Jon will fight for a $15 minimum wage, expanded health care for all and a strong COVID-19 emergency bill to help workers, small businesses and rural\u00a0hospitals. Since 1990, there has been a massive transfer of wealth from workers\u00a0to the people on top. While the 1% have seen their wealth go up by $22 trillion, the bottom 50% of Americans have seen their wealth go down by $776 billion. We need a strong middle class, not an oligarchy. The United States cannot continue to be the only major country not to guarantee health care to all. Too many people are unnecessarily dying, getting sick or going bankrupt because of this cruel and dysfunctional system. Health care is a human right, not a privilege. Let's do it. Progressives are leading the fight against oligarchy and for a strong middle class, against authoritarianism and for democracy. This country will not survive economically or politically when so few have so much, and so many live in desperation. Half of our people live paycheck to paycheck, 500,000 are homeless, 92 million are uninsured or underinsured and millions struggle with oppressive student debt. A new Congress, on day one, must address the enormous economic suffering facing working families. In this difficult time, Jane and I want to wish everyone a very Happy Thanksgiving.\u00a0We are especially mindful of those families who have lost loved ones during the pandemic, and who will feel those losses so keenly today.\u00a0Best wishes to all. The year 2020 has been very difficult for mental health. The pandemic, isolation and economic downturn has greatly increased depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. When we talk about real health care reform, we mean a major expansion of mental health services. As we approach Thanksgiving, a very special thanks must go out to the millions of courageous doctors, nurses and all health care workers who are putting their lives on the line battling this horrific pandemic. You are true heroes and heroines. Thank you. Yesterday, Trump took full credit for the 30,000 Dow Jones, but took zero credit for 260,000 Americans who died from COVID, 40 million who face eviction or 26 million who don't have enough food to eat on Thanksgiving. \n\nNo, Mr. President. The stock market is not the economy. The Democrats must make it clear: Do we stand with the struggling working class of this country, or powerful special interests? https://t.co/Bm0PWhnb6D RT @guardianopinion: How do we avoid future authoritarians?

I strongly support their efforts. https://t.co/ywldDO5hzv Our young people are the most progressive generation in U.S. history, and they're making their voices heard. As a result of a huge increase in voter turnout, people under 30 played a major role in Biden's victory. They are transforming America. https://t.co/8c8x9qjSox There are a lot of good reasons to veto the Defense Bill, including it's $740 billion cost. But Trump's reason is not one of them. Yes. In the year 2020, American troops should not be living in army bases named after Confederate military leaders who fought to defend slavery. RT @strikewave: BIG DEAL: Union election petition filed at @amazon Fulfillment Center in Alabama by @RWDSU. Potential 1500 workers in the b\u2026 All workers are entitled to decent wages and working conditions, which is why I stand with the Amazon warehouse workers in Alabama exercising their constitutional right to form a union. Mr. Bezos, the wealthiest person in America, must not interfere in this election. Health care is a human right, not a job benefit.\u00a0We cannot continue spending twice as much per capita as any other country, while 92\u00a0million are uninsured or under-insured, and 68,000 die unnecessarily each year.\u00a0Medicare for All is coming sooner or later.\u00a0Let's make it sooner. We must never \"normalize\" authoritarianism. In ways that would've been beyond belief a few years ago, Trump and his team, through outrageous lies and conspiracy theories, are undermining American democracy. They must not and will not succeed. Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Trump, the most dangerous president ever, golfs and sends out bogus tweets in an outrageous and desperate attempt to overturn an election he lost by more than 6 million votes. Bye-bye, Trump. You will not destroy American democracy. This is what Georgia's senate runoff elections mean: strong COVID relief, $15 minimum wage, expanded healthcare, tackling climate change, addressing systemic racism and immigration reform \u2013 and removing Mitch McConnell as Majority Leader. Let's do it. In 2016, when Trump won MI, PA and WI by 77, 000 votes, it was part of his \"landslide\" victory. \n\nIn 2020, when Biden won MI, PA and WI by 255,000 votes, and won the popular vote by 6 million, it was \"voter fraud.\"\u00a0\n\nWe will not allow Trump to destroy American democracy. It is beyond pathetic for a sitting president to try to subvert the results of an election. It is even worse when the Republican Party, with few exceptions, remains silent over this outrageous attack on democracy.\u00a0The GOP has ceased to be a political party. It is now a cult. We must do everything possible to make me sure we become a vibrant democracy, and that means doing the exact opposite of what Trump and his authoritarian friends want to do. https://t.co/FXYsaOoWgq RT @thenation: Today @BernieSanders joins The Nation Festival at 6pm EST!

If Congress doesn't act immediately, 12 million Americans will see all of their unemployment benefits expire the day after Christmas.\n\nMeanwhile, the only thing GOP Senators are interested in is confirming right-wing judges and trying to delegitimize the election. Pathetic. https://t.co/WslgSGOfGc The major political conflict we face now is not over policy.\u00a0It's about whether or not we remain a democracy.\u00a0Frighteningly, many Republican officials are abandoning the rule of law to become part of the Trump authoritarian cult.\u00a0We will fight back and win.

Standing up for working families means making sure that government contracts are only given to companies that make products in the United States. No more corporate welfare to companies that throw American workers out on the street and move abroad. https://t.co/iMW3sI12Yq I always find it amusing when our opponents talk about the \u201cfar-left\u201d agenda.\n\nThe truth is our ideas are common sense ideas that the majority of the American people support. https://t.co/imiUj32B7n Donald Trump will go down in history not just as a racist, sexist, xenophobe and religious bigot. He will be remembered as a demagogue who, more than anyone else, attempted to undermine the rule of law and destroy American democracy. He will not be missed. Over 1,000 Americans are dying each day from the coronavirus. 40 million Americans face eviction. 92 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured. It's time for the Republicans to stop trying to delegitimize the election and work with us to pass a COVID-19 relief bill NOW! No figure in history has done more to undermine American democracy than Donald Trump.\u00a0His \"birther\" movement tried to delegitimize the Obama presidency.\u00a0His refusal to accept defeat now is trying to undermine the Biden presidency.\u00a0Goodbye Trump. Happy to hear @RoKhanna is in the mix for U.S. Senate.\u00a0Ro was a co-chair of my presidential campaign, has a bold vision for America and is a proven fighter for working people. \n\nhttps://t.co/1WxmoJeLgR The refusal of Republican leaders to acknowledge the results of the presidential election is not just an attack on Biden. It is an attack on American democracy, and shows the degree to which the Republican party is moving toward authoritarianism. We are making progress in reforming a broken and racist criminal justice system. New prosecutors across the country are being elected who want to end the \"war on drugs.\" Instead of throwing more people in jail, they want to address the causes of crime.  \nhttps://t.co/suy9xnw0U8 Narcissist in Chief.\u00a0While the pandemic rages across the country, Trump spends his day plotting how he can overturn the election results. Fortunately, we will soon have a president who believes in science and who is prepared to serve the American people, not himself. The business model of Wells Fargo &amp; its disgraced former CEO John Stumpf is fraud. The $2.5 million fine he paid for scamming customers will allow him to walk away with over $200 million. Unacceptable. We must make sure that no bank is too big to fail &amp; no CEO is too big to jail. Americans killed in World War I: Over 116,000\n\nAmericans killed in Vietnam War: Over 58,000\n\nAmericans killed in Korean War: Over 36,000\n\nAmericans killed by the coronavirus: Over 242,000\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a humanitarian disaster. Please wear a mask. The pandemic is surging, and tens of millions of Americans are facing economic devastation. The Senate needs to pass a real stimulus package NOW that provides $2,000 a month to the working class, $600 a week to the unemployed and expands Medicare to all. Instead of fighting to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic that has killed over 242,000 Americans, the Trump administration is spending its final days in office fighting a bogus voter \"fraud\" problem that does not exist. Pathetic. The Biden-Harris Administration cannot come soon enough. No, Secretary Pompeo. There won't be a transition to a second Trump term. The race has been called. Joe Biden will be our next president. How can you lecture other governments to respect democracy and the will of their people when you don\u2019t have the decency to do so yourself? https://t.co/dtQoZN4WIx 112 co-sponsors of Medicare for All were on the ballot in November. All 112 won.\n\n98 co-sponsors of the Green New Deal were on the ballot. Only one lost.\n\nOur proposals are not just good policy. They are good politics. https://t.co/nkX0dpNH4Z The American people want a government that works for all, not just the few. That\u2019s the right thing to do, that\u2019s the moral thing to do and, for the Democratic Party, that is the way to win elections.\nhttps://t.co/Kr7pAvUa31 What Trump is doing right now is delegitimizing our electoral process and American democracy. https://t.co/RRbfoAcJSn Today is a day to honor the extraordinary sacrifice and bravery of our veterans and their families, and make certain they get all the benefits they need and were promised. And we must continue striving for a world of peace, not war. #VeteransDay Defeating Trump and electing Joe Biden was a beginning.\n\nNow the progressive movement is going to rally the American people around an agenda that works for working people. https://t.co/Xxz79xQFfg When we talk about the destructiveness of this terrible COVID-19 pandemic we must not ignore what it has done to mental health.\n\nDepression: up.\nAnxiety: up.\nSuicidal ideation: up.\n\nAt the federal, state and local levels we must address the mental health crisis impacting America. If we ended Citizens United...\n\nIf we stopped billionaires from buying politicians...\n\nIf we moved to the public funding of elections...\n\nIf we abolished the electoral college...\n\nThe political reality of America would be fundamentally different for the better. Let's get it done. 112 co-sponsors of Medicare for All were on the ballot. All of them won.\n\n98 co-sponsors of the Green New Deal were on the ballot. Only 1 lost. \n\nSupporting Medicare for All and the Green New Deal is not just good public policy.  \n\nIt is also good politics. 47% of workers in Georgia make less than $15 an hour and 71% of voters in Georgia support increasing the federal minimum wage.\n\nIf Democrats take back the Senate, we will increase the minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 an hour to a living wage of at least $15 an hour. Every year, 68,000 Americans die because they can't afford to go to a doctor on time \u2013 almost 200 people a day. Health care is a human right. Lack of health care is a death sentence. We must guarantee health care to everyone through a Medicare for All, single-payer program. With the coronavirus pandemic surging, it's refreshing to see new leadership coming into power who actually believe in science. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris understand that our first order of business must be to defeat this deadly virus. Let's get it done! Joe Biden will win the popular vote by over 4 million votes. The Democratic nominee for president has now won the popular vote in 7 out of the last 8 elections. One person, one vote. Democracy must rule.\n\nYes. We should abolish the electoral college. Florida passed a $15 minimum wage\n\nMontana, South Dakota, Arizona &amp; New Jersey legalized marijuana\n\nColorado passed 12 weeks of paid family leave\n\nArizona increased taxes on the rich to fund education\n\nAll over America, voters approved a progressive agenda. Now, Congress must act Today is a day of celebration. We have accomplished something that our children, grandchildren and future generations will look back upon and say to us, \u201cThank you.\u201d https://t.co/Scll1d7kql This election was about whether or not we remain a country that believes in the Constitution, that believes in the rule of law and that believes in democracy. \n\nAnd thank God, democracy won out. https://t.co/c5qbS3wess Congratulations to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for their historic win.\u00a0In this incredibly difficult moment in American history, I wish them the best as they attempt to bring our nation together around an agenda of economic, social, racial and environmental justice. I want to congratulate all those who worked so hard to make this historic day possible. Now, through our continued grassroots organizing, let us create a government that works for ALL and not the few. Let us create a nation built on justice, not greed and bigotry. Tonight, as we celebrate Joe Biden\u2019s apparent election victory, we understand that our struggle is not over. It has just begun. https://t.co/8cnSnojXmm The youth of this country are leading the fight for economic, social, racial and environmental justice.

I want to thank progressive grassroots organizations for their extraordinary efforts in helping to make Biden's victory possible.\u00a0Together, you built widespread support for Biden among young people, people of color and the working class. Congratulations.\u00a0Let's keep going forward.

But that's not all we have to do.

We will not have a strong economy and save lives unless we roll back the COVID virus. We will not roll back COVID until we have a president who believes in science. Trump is a danger to our health and our economy, and on Nov. 3rd we will get rid of him. \u201cPeople are tired of listening to Fauci and these idiots,\u201d Trump said. When Trump rejects science, downplays the pandemic &amp; relies on right-wing conspiracy theories, we shouldn't be shocked the virus is surging &amp; we have the highest COVID death rate per capita of major countries. With a Democratic majority in the House and Senate we must end the absurdity of women making 80 cents on the dollar compared to men.\u00a0Equal pay for equal work is not a radical idea. We have now done 15 virtual rallies in battleground states. The message is the same. Trump became president by winning PA, MI and WI by only 110,000 votes combined.\u00a0Your vote counts.\u00a0Let us respond to Republican voter suppression by voting in record-breaking numbers.

Mr. President: You attack \u201csocialized medicine\u201d every single day. Well, let's be clear. The excellent care you received at Walter Reed was at a 100% government-funded, government run hospital. For Trump, \"socialized medicine\" is bad for everyone but himself. Total hypocrisy!

Find your polling place here: https://t.co/qW8qKJuAKz https://t.co/uI9PkEIQiU As we celebrate Labor Day let us not forget that in recent months, while the very rich have grown much richer, tens of millions of workers have lost their jobs, and many families are now struggling to put food on the table and avoid eviction. Congress must act to protect workers. Strong unions mean decent wages and a strong middle class.\n\nCongress must make it easier for workers to join unions and engage in collective bargaining.\n\nWe must end the heavy-handed corporate tactics that prevent workers from unionizing. RT @RightsVT: Next Monday! Sen. Bernie Sanders and singer/songwriter Myra Flynn will be joining our exciting line-up of speakers for Labor\u2026 On this Labor Day we must pledge to end starvation wages in America. Raising the minimum wage to at least $15 per hour will give 40 million workers a long overdue pay raise, and a shred of human dignity. On this Labor Day let us not forget that over the last 30 years the top 1% have seen a $22 trillion increase in their wealth, while the bottom half of the American people have actually seen a decline in their wealth. We need an economy that works for all, not just the few. As we celebrate Labor Day I want to thank all of America's workers for what you do.\n\nThank you to all of the essential workers who are quite literally putting their lives on the line.\n\nLet us create an economy that works for all, and not just the few. #LaborDay2020 Labor Day weekend is not only a time to thank workers. It is also a time to reflect on how the working class of this country is doing and where we want to be in the future. https://t.co/hzQgsD5Z96 Today, I say to Mitch McConnell: Do your job.

That is unbelievably dangerous. We must defeat Trump and pass a Green New Deal. https://t.co/wFpNUMU51J Today we have to come together in a united front and say to this president: Sorry, too many people fought and died to preserve this democracy. You\u2019re not going to destroy it. https://t.co/SofrhUDFNc Let us work hard to deliver Joe Biden an overwhelming victory on election night. But, we must also stay vigilant, and do everything possible to prevent Trump from staying in power if he loses. Nothing less than our democracy is at stake. Fourth, we need Congressional hearings with local officials to learn how they plan to handle the Election Day process and the days that follow. Every agency of government\u2014federal, state and local\u2014must do everything possible to ensure that we have a free and fair election. Third, social media companies must finally get their act together and stop people from using their tools to threaten and harass election officials, spread disinformation, and organize voter intimidation and disinformation on their sites. Second, the news media needs to prepare the American people to understand there is no longer a single Election Day and that we may not know the results on November 3. Absent a national conversation about that reality, conspiracy theories and disinformation will likely thrive. First, with the pandemic and a massive increase in mail-in voting, state legislatures must take action to allow votes to be counted before Election Day. We must avoid a situation where battleground states are counting millions of votes for days and weeks after Election Day. We must do everything we can to ensure @JoeBiden wins by the largest possible margin. We also must consider what happens if Trump loses but refuses to abide by the results and does everything he can to hold onto power. Tomorrow at 2 p.m. ET, join our live Labor Day weekend town hall on how we must stand up to Trump and build worker power across the country. Tune in at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/x5BWIkE1LY This is shocking, even for Trump. The men and women who lost their lives defending our country are patriots \u2013 not \u201closers\u201d and \u201csuckers.\u201d Trump must be defeated and defeated badly.\nhttps://t.co/f8Gk72J8KD If there's going to be class war in this country it's time the working class won that war.

We must not only suspend evictions, foreclosures, and utility shut-offs. We must cancel rent and mortgage payments until the crisis is over.

Period. https://t.co/DaTIGdIfaq For years, Donald Trump has lied about \"voter fraud.\" Now he proceeds to tell the people of North Carolina to commit a felony by voting twice. This is not a president who believes in democracy. He is an authoritarian who must be defeated.

No. We will defeat you and expand Social Security, the most successful anti-poverty program in history. This Saturday, join my virtual Vermont town hall, featuring @zuckermanforvt and other guests, to discuss the challenges facing Vermonters heading into the election. Tune in at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS at 4 p.m. ET. https://t.co/IXYp7IKIot It\u2019s no great secret that Joe Biden and I disagree on a number of issues. But there\u2019s no question that the economic proposals Joe Biden is supporting are strong and will go a long, long way in improving life for working families. We must elect him and throw Trump out of office. https://t.co/wjJF1pPrTn The mainstream media doesn't talk about it.\n\nCongress doesn't talk about it.\n\nTrump doesn't talk about it.\n\nBut three multi-billionaires now own more wealth than the bottom half of our society.\n\nThat level of inequality is immoral and unsustainable. In the richest country on Earth no one should suddenly lose their health insurance, let alone during a pandemic. It's outrageous that our corporate-run system treats health insurance as an employee benefit, not a right. We must end that disgrace and pass Medicare for All. https://t.co/pFR93cNCm6 Trump claims he's a \"law and order\" president. That's funny. This is a president who shamelessly violates the Constitution, incites violence, uses his office to enrich his family, and seven of his top campaign advisers have been criminally charged (so far). Trump must go. Mr. President, your job is to discourage violence, not incite it. Trump\u2019s proposal to permanently terminate the payroll tax could defund Social Security and eliminate benefits for senior citizens and people with disabilities in &lt;4 years. That\u2019s not Bernie Sanders talking. That\u2019s what the Social Security Administration recently reported to us. Three months ago the House responded to the enormous pain and suffering of the American people by passing a $3.5 trillion relief package.\n\nWhat has McConnell and the Republican-led Senate done since then?\n\nNothing except pass a bloated Pentagon budget and take a vacation. Young people: your generation holds the future of the nation in your hands. If young people voted at the same rate as older people, we could transform this country. https://t.co/jLgf1HKrVq \u201cThis pandemic has not affected all of us equally.

I don\u2019t want to shock anybody, but what Donald Trump said was a lie. https://t.co/hwE3Y3lIuS Trump is a fraud and a liar. He promised to help working people.

Thank you to the many, many people who are showing up and carrying forward the fight for racial justice. Mr. President, if you believe in the American people and our way of life so much, tell them tonight that you are prepared to leave office when you lose. Democracy \u2013 that\u2019s what America is about. #PromisesBroken Mr. President, if you love the American people so much, why are you trying to divide us up based on the color of our skin, our gender, our country of origin and our religion? #PromisesBroken Yes, this is the most important election in history. And you are the most dangerous president in the history of our country. That\u2019s why you\u2019re going to lose. #PromisesBroken Trump promised he would provide \"health insurance to everybody.\" But he is now in court actively trying to take health insurance away from 32 million Americans and eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions during a global pandemic. #PromisesBroken One more lie. Trump's budget cuts Medicare by $845 billion and he promised to defund Social Security by permanently terminating the payroll tax. #PromisesBroken According to documented sources, Trump has made 20,000 lies and distortions while in office, and that is before this speech. Will he ever stop lying to the American people? #PromisesBroken I don\u2019t know if this is a record, maybe the last \u201cLaw and Order\u201d president Richard Nixon beat it, but seven of Trump\u2019s top campaign advisers have been criminally charged \u2026 so far. #PromisesBroken 400,000 Americans should not be kept in jail for the \u201ccrime\u201d of being poor and unable to afford bail. #PromisesBroken Yes, Mr. President, it is the women of this country who control their own bodies, not you. #PromisesBroken Here is the Trump manifesto: a government of lies, corruption, greed and rejection of science. #PromisesBroken Trump promised that \u201cthe rich would not be gaining at all\u201d under his tax plan. But the tax bill he signed into law provides 83% of the benefits to the top 1% while raising taxes on 92 million Americans by the end of the decade. #PromisesBroken Stop the lies. Doctors and nurses today still don\u2019t have the masks, gowns and gloves they need to protect themselves and our lives. #PromisesBroken Yes, Trump wants to spend billions on a Space Force, but half a million Americans are homeless and 45 million Americans have student debt. Let's get our priorities right. Invest in working Americans, Mr. President. #PromisesBroken In Michigan, there are 57,000 fewer manufacturing jobs than when Trump took office.\n\nIn Wisconsin, there are 11,000 fewer manufacturing jobs than when Trump took office.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, there are today 25,000 less manufacturing jobs than when Trump took office. #PromisesBroken Trump: Abraham Lincoln. \nFox: News. Trump took away the legal rights of the 1.8 million young people eligible for DACA. That is an outrage. Those rights must be restored. #PromisesBroken This is a president who said he was going to \"drain the swamp,\" but has used his office for blatant personal and political gain, running the most corrupt administration in modern American history. #PromisesBroken Trump just LOVES socialism when it\u2019s his family feeding at the trough for $885 million in government subsidies and tax breaks to build a real-estate empire on racial discrimination. #PromisesBroken Trump's rejection of science has contributed to the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Americans. We need a president who believes in science. #PromisesBroken Remember the state of the economy before the pandemic?\n\nHalf of Americans lived paycheck to paycheck\n40% of adults didn't have $400 for an emergency\n87 million uninsured or underinsured\n41 million workers made under $15/hour\n\nNope. That was not a \"great economy.\"\n\n#PromisesBroken At a time when California is on fire, when Hurricane Laura is doing devastating harm, when is Trump going to get to the part when he tells us that climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese? #PromisesBroken We have a president whose contempt for the law is so clear that he holds a political rally at the White House. #PromisesBroken We need to protect our democracy and stop the slide into oligarchy. Join @JulieOliverTX, @RepRoKhanna, @ZephyrTeachout, and @Tiffany_Muller for a live roundtable about getting corporate money out of politics: https://t.co/kyRxObpHoB Trump has betrayed the working people of this country and our job tonight, and in the next 68 days, is to expose him for the fraud and pathological liar that he is. I hope to see you while I live-tweet his speech later tonight. #PromisesBroken Trump promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. That was another whopper. His budgets proposed slashing all three and his \u201cpayroll tax holiday\u201d is designed to bankrupt Social Security and Medicare. #PromisesBroken Trump said he'd stand up for working families, yet today the rich are getting much richer and there is more income and wealth inequality than any time since the 1920s. Three people now own more wealth than the bottom half of our nation. #PromisesBroken Trump promised to provide health care \u201cto everyone,\u201d yet has tried to throw 32 million people off their health insurance. Today, millions more people have no health insurance than when Trump came into office. #PromisesBroken Let the prebuttal begin! Watching Trump tonight will be hard because you just can't keep up with all the lies. But I will be watching and live-tweeting, hoping he will apologize to the American people for his #PromisesBroken. It's unacceptable that the 4 richest men in the U.S. now own a record-breaking $542 billion in wealth while 92 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured. It's time to tax the windfall profits of these billionaires and expand Medicare to all. I strongly support the NBA, WNBA and MLB players who are striking for racial justice. Real change takes place when people come together and demand it. It is time for the police who shot Jacob Blake seven times in the back to be fired, arrested and prosecuted. Now. Hurricane Laura producing an unsurvivable storm surge in Texas and Louisiana. A catastrophic 800-mile derecho in Iowa and Illinois. Raging wildfires in California. No. The Green New Deal is not radical. Having a president in office who calls climate change a hoax\u2014that's radical. When Trump says \"America will never become a socialist country,\" remember: his New York real estate empire would be worth nothing without $885 million in government grants, subsidies and tax breaks. Trump l-o-v-e-s corporate socialism for himself, rugged capitalism for the rest. Join me this Saturday for two more town halls featuring leaders, activists, and candidates in Colorado and Texas to discuss how we must tackle the crises we face and hold Republicans accountable.\n\nTune in at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/2u7lZLgIuk During the last campaign, candidate Trump promised the American people he would not cut Social Security. We now know that was a lie. No, Mr. President. We will not let you defund Social Security. We are going to sweep you out of office and we are going to expand Social Security. https://t.co/SosH1SiHjw No more tear gas, no more pepper spray, no more rubber bullets on protestors. Ban them all.\nhttps://t.co/TYP5PfXgNI Remember: A year after Trump's tax plan was signed into law, 91 corporations paid nothing in federal incomes taxes after making billions in profits, including:\n\nAmazon\nNetflix\nGeneral Motors\nChevron\nFedEx\nEli Lilly\nStarbucks\nWhirlpool\n\nTrump's tax plan was a giveaway to the rich. We must come together to defeat Trump and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next president and vice president.\n\nMy friends, the price of failure is just too great to imagine. https://t.co/otqxn1SPR4 Trump said he would stand with working families,\n\nhe said he would \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d\n\nhe said he\u2019d provide health care to everybody,\n\nhe said he\u2019d protect Medicare and Social Security.\n\nYou can see now that he is a fraud and he lied to all of us. https://t.co/eonLbBhPoY Never forget. While Trump and the Republican Senate denied hazard pay to essential workers, their tax plan allowed Amazon to pay nothing in federal income taxes after making $29 billion in profits. Yes. Trump loves socialism for the rich, rugged capitalism for everyone else. This is not just an election on the issues. This is an election on the future of American democracy. https://t.co/9vOtftuA15 We must fight back against Trump's efforts to destroy USPS.

Congress cannot wait any longer to act forcefully to end the horrific violence against Black Americans at the hands of police. We cannot accept that our children and grandchildren must face worse fires, worse hurricanes, worse floods and more disasters every year. We must stand up to the fossil fuel industry and end their greed. We must pass a Green New Deal. https://t.co/BNIvc8SSh3 100 days.\n\nThat's how long ago the House passed a bill to extend $600 a week to 30 million unemployed workers, $1,200 for the working class, hazard pay and $25 billion for the Post Office.\n\nDuring this time, the Senate passed a $740 billion Pentagon budget and took a vacation. If there's going to be a class war in this country, it's time the working class won that war. We can no longer tolerate 3 billionaires owning more wealth than the bottom 50%. We must tax the obscene gains billionaires made in the pandemic and create an economy that works for all. California is on fire. Once in a lifetime hurricanes are sweeping the Gulf Coast. The Arctic topped 100 degrees. The future of our planet is at stake this election. We can no longer have a president in office who rejects science and calls climate change a hoax. #GreenNewDeal Never forget. While the Republican Senate refused to extend $600/week for 30 million unemployed workers, it had no problem passing a $1 trillion tax break to the top 1% and large corporations. Trump and the Republicans love socialism for the rich, rugged capitalism for the rest. How absurd. Now, Trump believes he's not only smarter than scientists, but that they are actively plotting against his re-election. We need a president who listens to scientists, not someone who concocts bizarre conspiracy theories. The \"very stable genius\" must be defeated. https://t.co/389bCXKxWa While 92 million can't afford health care, the 4 richest Americans are now worth $512.8 billion:\n\n- Jeff Bezos: $193 billion\n- Bill Gates: $122 billion\n- Mark Zuckerberg: $101 billion\n- Elon Musk: $96.8 billion\n\nIt's time to tax the billionaire class and expand Medicare to all. This November, we have got to come out and vote in record-breaking numbers.\n\nGet your mail-in ballots sent early.\n\nBring your friends and neighbors to the polls.\n\nOur job is to defeat Trump and remind him what democracy is. https://t.co/aWj92eGbPF Over 1 million Americans filed for unemployment this week.

Trump plays golf at his country club and Senate Republicans take a vacation while 40 million Americans face eviction and 30 million workers are unemployed. It's time for the Senate to do its job, protect working families and get back to work now. Medicare for All is not a radical idea, but let me tell you what is. A cruel system that causes 92 million Americans to be uninsured or under-insured during a pandemic, while the health care industry made $54.6 billion in profits during the last quarter alone. That's radical. Every year we see more extreme weather disasters. Every year we see more people displaced, homes destroyed and lives lost due to climate change.\n\nWe cannot accept that this is our children\u2019s future. \n\nWe must end dependence on fossil fuels and pass a Green New Deal. https://t.co/JMOFUu4UWu We have a president who has admitted that he is trying to destroy the Postal Service to prevent people from voting.

I know that Joe Biden will begin that fight on day one. #DemConvention Since this pandemic began, 30+ million people have lost their jobs and many have lost their health insurance. \n\nMillions are wondering how they'll feed their kids and worried that they will be evicted. \n\nTrump\u2019s negligence has exacerbated the economic crisis. #DemConvention Trump isn't just a threat to our democracy, but by rejecting science he has put our lives in jeopardy.\n\nTrump has attacked doctors and scientists trying to protect us from the pandemic and refused to take strong action.\n\nNero fiddled while Rome burned; Trump golfs. #DemConvention Under this administration, authoritarianism has taken root in our country.

Wealth gains by billionaires during the pandemic:\n\nJeff Bezos: +$71 billion\nWalton Family: +$21 billion\nMark Zuckerberg: +$38 billion\n\nBy taxing 60% of the wealth gains by 467 billionaires, we could cover all out-of-pocket health care costs for a year. \"For all the corporate bullies and corporations that think they\u2019re going to make government about them, there\u2019s a bunch of us coming.

You\u2019ve got to fight for it. https://t.co/90glOdFaq7 Our movement gets stronger every day. Join me now for a livestream with @CoriBush, @RashidaTlaib and @JamaalBowmanNY to discuss their historic victories and the next steps for our movement. https://t.co/jmRBTNLG8P It is time for the Senate to act on behalf of the working class who are hurting like they have never hurt before, not the billionaire class who are doing phenomenally well and have never had it so good. We have a choice to make. We can continue to allow the very rich to get much richer while everyone else gets poorer and poorer. Or we can tax the winnings a handful of billionaires made during the pandemic to improve the health and well-being of tens of millions of Americans. In my view, we can no longer tolerate the three wealthiest people in America owning more wealth than the bottom 50 percent, while over 30 million Americans have lost their jobs and 92 million people are either uninsured or under-insured. Yes, by taxing 60% of the wealth gains made by just 467 billionaires during this pandemic, we could guarantee health care as a right for an entire year. And billionaires would still be able to pocket over $310 billion in gains during the worst downturn since the Great Depression. If we taxed 60% of the windfall gains 467 billionaires made from March 18th until August 3rd we could raise over $420 billion. That\u2019s enough revenue to allow Medicare to pay all of the out-of-pocket health care expenses for everyone in America over the next 12 months. At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, when so many our people are hurting, it is morally obscene for billionaires to use a global pandemic as an opportunity to make outrageous profits. While millions of Americans are lining up at emergency food banks because they don\u2019t have enough money to put food on the table, Mark Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook has increased his wealth by more than $37 billion during the pandemic and is now worth over $90 billion. While 40 million Americans face eviction, Elon Musk has nearly tripled his wealth over the past four months and now has a net worth of more than $70 billion. While U.S. taxpayers are subsidizing the starvation wages at Walmart, our nation\u2019s largest private employer, the Walton family has made over $20 billion during the pandemic and now has a net worth of over $200 billion. While Amazon is denying paid sick leave, hazard pay and personal protective equipment to 450,000 of its workers, Jeff Bezos has increased his wealth by over $70 billion. Let me give you a few examples of the incredible growth in inequality that is taking place during this horrific pandemic. In the midst of a president undermining democracy and moving us toward an authoritarian government, in the midst of all of that, we are seeing a massive increase in income and wealth inequality and the movement in this country toward oligarchy. In other words, in the midst of a pandemic, in the midst of an economic meltdown for working families, in the midst of a great struggle regarding systemic racism and police brutality, in the midst of the existential threat of climate change... In all likelihood, in the midst of everything else, we are currently witnessing what is likely the greatest transfer of wealth from the middle class and the poor to the very rich in the modern history of this country. Meanwhile, during the last four months, while the very, very rich have become much richer, American households have seen their wealth go down by $6.5 trillion. Let me repeat that. 467 billionaires have seen their wealth go up by over $730 billion during the pandemic. While over 30 million Americans have seen their $600 a week in unemployment benefits expire, emergency actions taken by the Federal Reserve to prop up the stock market have meant that 467 billionaires saw their wealth go up by over $730 billion since the pandemic began. What I think many people do not fully understand is that not everyone is hurting in America.  Not everyone needs the Senate to act. I will be introducing legislation tomorrow to tax the obscene wealth gains billionaires have made during the public health crisis. .@RepRabhi\u2019s big win means he will continue to lead the charge for the state\u2019s universal health care bill and renewable energy plan in the Michigan House of Representatives.\n\nCongratulations all on your victories! https://t.co/wyUgG05AOm From Medicare for All and a $15 minimum wage to a Green New Deal and college for all, we are lucky to have @AbrahamAiyash fighting for our agenda in Michigan. https://t.co/NBu0ym95zS Voters are demanding real criminal justice reform, and they proved it by propelling @kdmcdonald2020 to a huge victory over the incumbent prosecutor in Oakland County, Michigan. https://t.co/RIfmzexLBN .@EliNSavit ran and won a progressive platform to take on the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s greed and corruption, and to protect tenants and consumers when their rights are violated. https://t.co/zbgcCQsqke The people of Missouri voted to expand Medicaid, saying clearly that nobody should go without health care.

IT! \n\nWe've talked to voters, we've built coalitions, we've oragnized our communiites, and now, the polls are OPEN!\u2026 How surreal it is to have a president who supports conspiracy nuts, rejects science and attacks epidemiologists like Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx. Trump's \"handling\" of the pandemic has cost us tens of thousands of lives. For the health and safety of America, Trump must be defeated. LIVE NOW: I'm joining @PplsAction to talk about why we need a huge voter turnout to defeat Donald Trump and transform our country so it works for all of us. https://t.co/rYm9xRWJSi 10. Donald Trump is hostile to the LGBTQ community. 9. Donald Trump is a religious bigot. 8. Donald Trump is a sexist. 7. Donald Trump is a xenophobe. 6. Donald Trump is a racist. 5. Donald Trump's policies benefit his billionaire friends, while attacking the needs of working families. 4. Donald Trump does not believe in science. 3. Donald Trump is a pathological liar. 2. Donald Trump does not understand or respect the Constitution of the United States. 1. Donald Trump is, at his core, an authoritarian leader who does not believe in democracy. I want to give you ten reasons (and there are many more) as to why, together, we have got to do everything we can to create the largest voter turnout in history and send Trump packing. This is a no-brainer. Masks are not a political or partisan issue. Providing all of our people with high-quality, reusable masks without cost will save tens of thousands of lives and save our economy billions of dollars. https://t.co/iihyD3m6Pb Defeating Donald Trump and transforming this country is going to require a historic voter turnout.\n\nTonight I\u2019m joining @PplsAction, a leading organization in this fight, for the Rise Up 2020 Get Out The Vote Launch. RSVP here: https://t.co/0CGTceNlKR Our dysfunctional health care system becomes more cruel each day:\n\n-5.4 million Americans lost health insurance\n\n-92 million people are uninsured or under-insured\n\nWhile the health care industry made $43 billion in 3rd quarter profits\n\nWe need Medicare for All now more than ever. In the years I've known @tanyavforvt, she has impressed me with her dedication to working class and marginalized Vermonters. At this very difficult moment for working families in Vermont, she has been a tireless advocate for justice. https://t.co/19SFRnIX0Q I have worked with @ErhardMahnke  on countless issues ever since I was Mayor of Burlington. His entire career has been dedicated to making sure that all Vermonters lead lives of dignity. I am proud to endorse him for the Vermont State Senate. https://t.co/TT1mKzdWt9 I have worked with @SenatorCP for decades.  He is a strong progressive who will continue to lead the fight for economic, social, racial and environmental justice. At this very difficult moment, we need strong and courageous leaders like Chris Pearson in Montpelier. https://t.co/rgQn1K0wFn As Auditor, @douglashoffer  has never been afraid to ask the tough questions and follow the facts. I am proud to endorse his re-election campaign because he has always, and will always, fight for all Vermonters. https://t.co/ffd2DDW2xw I'm proud to endorse @TJforVermont's re-election campaign for Vermont Attorney General so that he can continue to fight against the greed of the pharmaceutical industry, a ban on life without parole and expanding the practice of expungement in Vermont. https://t.co/G45NgU8VOa This is the most important election of our lifetimes. Vote early, and organize your friends, coworkers and co-students to vote as well. https://t.co/yVebMG8oZF People are at their wits' end.\n\nThey are wondering how they are going to feed their families while Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans have done nothing for two and a half months. https://t.co/VEv2dsQmXf I'm endorsing @ElectSharlett's grassroots campaign because she knows that to make real change we must put the needs of the working class over corporate profits and take on powerful special interests. https://t.co/Wg0zVSmrQ7 Steve Mnuchin wants to slash $600 a week in unemployment benefits for 30 million workers who lost jobs, but supports the continuation of a $500 billion slush fund for corporations.\n\nThe Trump Administration loves socialism for the rich, unfettered capitalism for everyone else. https://t.co/hkH1pZVmX9 Democrats in the House passed legislation to address the unemployment crisis two months ago.\n\nBut Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans have done nothing.\n\nMillions of people cannot wait. The time to act is now. https://t.co/stUzMQuI5I And the very rich get much richer. Over half of American households have lost income during the pandemic, while 491 billionaires have increased their wealth by $743 billion. This is obscene. We need an economy that works for all, not a rigged economy for the wealthy and powerful. The clock is ticking. While the economy tanks, some 30 million workers are losing their $600 a week unemployment supplement. Their families are facing hunger, eviction and foreclosure. The House has acted. The Senate must act NOW. The U.S. economy shrank a record-breaking 33% in the second quarter. How many more Americans have to lose their jobs, health insurance and housing before the do-nothing Senate acts to protect the working class?\n\nExtend unemployment, pass $2,000 monthly payments &amp; cancel rent now. The House passed legislation to extend the expanded unemployment program on May 15.\n\nThat was 78 days ago.\n\nBut Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans refused to act. Now, 30 million Americans are scrambling to make ends meet. The Republicans must get their act together. Sad but not surprising. The Senate GOP chose to let $600 a week in unemployment benefits expire for 30 million Americans, but had no problem giving the Pentagon another $740 billion. We need new national priorities. Let's stand with workers, not the Military Industrial Complex. Eid Mubarak to all of our Muslim friends. May today bring peace, safety and happiness to you and your loved ones. No, Mr. President. You're not going to postpone the election. You're not going to dismantle the Postal Service. You\u2019re not going to undermine the vote-by-mail system. This election will have the largest voter turnout in history, and you're going to lose. https://t.co/8FxiYXu6CG I want to thank the Biden campaign, the delegates and the members of the committee who forged this agreement.

The House has done its job. The Republican leadership in the Senate must act. We must protect working families NOW. No, Mr. President. We're not delaying the election.

Meanwhile, we're the only major nation not to guarantee health care, paid family and medical leave or vacation time. We need a government that represents all of us, not just the few. Senate Republicans will propose a bill to slash unemployment benefits, increase the Pentagon budget and provide another tax break to CEOs. Unacceptable. We need a COVID-19 relief bill that works for the working class and the most vulnerable, not wealthy campaign contributors.

During this pandemic Jeff Bezos saw his wealth increase by $74 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, 50 million Americans are filing for unemployment, and millions face hunger, lack of health care and evictions.\n\nUnacceptable!\n\nWe must create an economy that works for all, not just the very rich. As coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths are surging to record levels across America, the Republican Senate has decided to provide more funding for the Pentagon than the next 11 nations\u2019 military budgets combined. Simply outrageous. \u201cEvery gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.\u201d -President Eisenhower\n\nWe must cut the Pentagon budget by 10%. https://t.co/s4wsLMKM0P Today I stand with workers across the country who are participating in the #StrikeForBlackLives. Our job as a nation: eradicate all forms of racial injustice in every part of our society so that Black Americans can finally live in security and dignity. We have got to transform our priorities. We should not pass a $740 billion defense budget at a time when so many are struggling. https://t.co/hvzRLkztIr Tens of millions of Americans have filed for unemployment and this is what the Republicans are offering? Instead, we should extend unemployment benefits, provide $2,000 a month to every American, and expand Medicare to all.\nhttps://t.co/WrjPK2Zpg1 In recent months 30 million workers have lost their jobs and their income. Many struggle to put food on the table. This week the Senate must pass a bill to fully extend unemployment benefits, provide a $2,000 monthly stipend and guarantee health care for the length of the crisis. In the richest nation in the world, people are forced to risk their lives for starvation wages. That is a moral outrage. Every worker deserves a living wage and a safe workplace, especially in the middle of a deadly pandemic. https://t.co/Vf6c4Enclo The U.S.A. is the only major country not to guarantee health care to all. If you're wealthy you can buy excellent care. If you're poor or working class, tough luck. You die younger and experience more illness and pain. Health care is a human right. We need Medicare for All. Amidst the many crises we face, we cannot ignore that the climate crisis is getting worse. Now is the time to end our dependence on fossil fuels and move to renewable energy. Now is the time for a Green New Deal. https://t.co/MBQ1S6vdKY Against the wishes of state and local officials, unmarked federal agents in combat gear have invaded parts of Portland, Oregon. This is what a police state looks like.  These troops must be withdrawn immediately. We must defend the Constitution. We must defeat Trump. Let\u2019s use the Defense Production Act and get every American the masks they need. https://t.co/lj9jErLNqY John Lewis inspired millions to fight for justice. His courage helped transform this country. He won\u2019t ever be forgotten by those who believe America can change when the people stand together and demand it. Our thoughts are with his loved ones. In Portland, federal agents in combat gear pulled protesters off the street and jailed them without charge. That is what a police state is all about. Now is the time to defend our Constitution. Now is the time to come together and defeat Trump's authoritarian policies. https://t.co/fZn1hrk4YE We must reduce the military budget by 10% and use that $74 billion in savings to invest in communities ravaged by extreme poverty, mass incarceration, decades of neglect and the COVID-19 pandemic. https://t.co/Ud15Y9BOGG In 2018, Floridians overwhelmingly voted to re-enfranchise felons. The outrageous poll tax passed in response to that referendum is racist voter suppression at its worst. Voting is a right, not a privilege.

While Americans pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, Gilead is charging more than $3,000 for a COVID-19 drug that costs $10 to manufacture and was developed after receiving a $70 million grant from the federal government. While Amazon refuses to provide paid sick leave to its workers and recently eliminated hazard pay for essential workers, the owner of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, has seen his wealth go up by $74 billion making him the wealthiest person in America with a net worth of $179 billion. While American households have lost $6.5 trillion in wealth and 50 million Americans have filed for unemployment, the wealth of 600 billionaires in America has gone up by $584 billion. While one out of five Americans cannot afford the medicine prescribed by their doctors, the CEO of Moderna became a billionaire overnight after his company received $483 million from the Trump administration to develop a potential coronavirus vaccine. While 28 million Americans are in danger of being evicted from their homes and thrown out on the street, JP Morgan Chase posted a record-breaking $33.8 billion in quarterly revenue. During the pandemic, while a record-breaking 5.4 million Americans lost their health insurance, UnitedHealth\u2014one of the largest health insurance companies in America\u2014made a record-breaking quarterly profit of $6.6 billion. Pharmaceutical companies have been given $6 billion in taxpayer dollars, and more to come, to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Once a safe and effective vaccine is approved by the FDA it must be made available to all for free. This is no time for profiteering. Don't let anybody fool you.

Rich or poor, Black, white or Latino \u2014 we need \"equal justice under law.\" Mitt Romney and I hold different opinions on virtually everything. But I agree with him strongly that Trump's commutation of Roger Stone's sentence is \"unprecedented, historic corruption.\" The key political question of our time is: Where are all the other Republicans? It's summer. It's hot. It's vacation time. Sadly, the U.S. is the only major country not to guarantee any paid vacation or holidays. The result: 1 in 4 workers get no paid vacation time or holidays. This is outrageous. We need an economy that works for workers, not just owners. We can keep winning races and electing progressives around the country, but we need your help. Join our #SummerOfAction and sign up to make calls today! https://t.co/VUUxxLRXi2 This month the Senate will vote on my amendment to cut the Pentagon's bloated $740 billion budget and invest in housing, health care, education and jobs in distressed communities here at home.

And thousands unnecessarily die. \n\nTrump rejects science on climate change. And the very future of the planet is at stake.\n\nWe cannot continue a government which rejects science.\n\nThis November, we must come together and reject Trump. Here's something we don't discuss much. Life expectancy is in direct correlation to income. If you're rich you're likely to live a much longer and healthier life than if you're poor. Poverty kills.

During this crisis we must keep people out of jail who shouldn't be there and continue our fight to end mass incarceration. https://t.co/N4aJGoFto8 Trump may not understand it, but high-quality masks, distributed to every American household and produced in the U.S. through the Defense Production Act, will save many thousands of lives.

While he continues to tell us how great the \"recovery\" is doing, the pandemic surges and millions face hunger, eviction and loss of health care. Together, we'll defeat Trump. Together, we'll move this country in a very different direction. The temperature in Siberia is 100 degrees, wildfires are raging there and sea ice is melting. In the midst of all the other crises we face, we cannot forget climate change. We must transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Now! Congratulations to the many Native Americans and advocates who struggled to defeat this terrible pipeline, which should never have been built. We must end our dependence on fossil fuels and stop putting corporate profits over Native American rights. The struggle continues. https://t.co/p03f3IEU4g Politicians and the corporate media won't discuss it much but over the past 30 years the wealth of the top 1% has gone up by $22.65 trillion, while the wealth of the bottom 50% has gone down by $776 billion. This growing wealth inequality is a moral obscenity. We need to stop bipartisan support for a bloated military budget. While defense contractors make huge profits and we spend more on the military than the next 11 nations combined, doctors and nurses lack masks to help us fight COVID-19. Insane priorities. We spend $740 billion on the Pentagon, but somehow we don't have enough money to provide health care, housing and childcare to all Americans. My amendment to cut the defense budget by 10% would begin to change our priorities. It will be voted on in the Senate the week of July 20. \u201cWe need elected leaders who are going to stand for what is morally right. Who are going to stand up for humanity.

In my view, the time is long overdue for us to take a hard look not only at the size of the Pentagon budget, but at the enormous amount of waste, cost overruns, fraud, and at the financial mismanagement that has plagued the Department of Defense for decades.

Fifty-one years after the Stonewall uprising, we remember the many LGBTQ+ activists who have fought for justice, equality and civil rights. The struggle continues and we stand with you. Trump denies science. The pandemic spreads. One way to help save lives and prevent illness is for Congress to pass my amendment which calls for the production and distribution of free, high-quality masks for every American household. Just when you think Trump cannot be more vile or racist, he outdoes himself. This morning he shared a video in which a supporter of his yells, \"white power.\" Let us stand together and make certain that this \"stable genius\" is defeated, and defeated badly, in November. When we say we have a rigged economy, that means billionaires getting richer during a pandemic while millions of people lose their jobs every week. https://t.co/gHFZktDv8o We need to cut our military budget by 10 percent and invest that money in human needs. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs and health insurance.\n\nWe should be empowering Medicare to cover all out-of-pocket health care costs.\n\nInstead, Trump has made it a priority during a pandemic to throw millions more people off of their health coverage.\n\nUnbelievable. https://t.co/hQcVwK0Pwt I am proud to endorse Mayor @CarmenYulinCruz for governor of Puerto Rico.\n\nThere is no one who will fight harder or more diligently for Puerto Ricans.\n\nIf you\u2019re able to, make a contribution to her campaign here: https://t.co/KdslfdeQb0 https://t.co/kfLLLnqPYP At this pivotal moment, we must make a decision.\n\nDo we want to spend billions more on endless wars, or do we want to provide decent jobs to millions of unemployed Americans?\n\nDo we want to spend more on nuclear weapons or to invest in decent jobs, child care, and health care?

They listened to science, acted boldly, and had leadership they could trust. In the U.S., Trump downplayed the crisis, attacked science and continues to lie.  They saved lives. We lost lives. https://t.co/fNK4McYawB We have a system today where, while millions lose their jobs, struggle to put food on the table, and cannot afford an education or health care, billionaires have gotten $565 billion richer during a pandemic. That is a system we cannot accept. We need to work from the ground up to transform our society. It\u2019s clear we cannot wait any longer to act forcefully and boldly to root out systemic racism and police violence. And when we act together, we win. https://t.co/tQxKuhMjD3 People cannot survive with dignity without decent jobs.

Black families have 1/10th the wealth of white families, over half of Black workers earn less than $15/hour, and Black families are much less likely to have decent health insurance.

Trump must end his ugly and racist declaration of war on Americans who are exercising their First Amendment right to peacefully protest. This is a democracy, not a dictatorship. https://t.co/5CEAFliqIh This is an unprecedented moment for our country. To keep the focus on the urgent need for justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and too many others victims of police violence, we are postponing our virtual \u201cA People\u2019s Graduation\u201d tomorrow. https://t.co/bd6I5s1CLq Those in power who want us to focus on looting and property damage instead of the thousands peacefully protesting are trying to distract us from the terrible violence that engulfs the lives of working people every day. As Coretta Scott King reminded us, violence takes many forms. https://t.co/Gz66Q2VWXs Trump just had peaceful demonstrators viciously attacked.  No, Mr. President. This is not a dictatorship. This is the United States of America. Our citizens have a constitutional right to peacefully protest. It's called the First Amendment. This Pride Month we say: LGBTQ+ rights are civil rights. There is no place in this country for discrimination, police brutality, or hatred towards LBGTQ+ Americans. We will never stop fighting for equality. Liar in Chief: According to a new report, Trump has made 19,127 false or misleading claims since taking office. A new poll finds only 35% of Americans believe he is honest. In a democracy we can have different views, but not a president who is a pathological liar. Mitch McConnell says we should end the $600 unemployment bonus because workers now earn more by not working.\n\nI've got a better approach.\n\nLet's end starvation wages in America and raise the minimum wage to a living wage.\n\nAll workers are entitled to a decent standard of living. We need real police department reform. Every police officer involved in a killing must be held accountable, and those found guilty must be punished with the full force of the law.  Every killing of a person held in police custody must be investigated by the Department of Justice. George Floyd\u2019s murder is not only an outrage. It is the latest manifestation of a system that callously devalues the lives of Black people. Our struggle is and always has been about justice\u2014not justice on paper, but real justice in the real lives of real people. https://t.co/03LHnirfHq What we need is a nation that fundamentally respects the human dignity of every person. That starts with justice for George Floyd. https://t.co/XvC3rd4tpS We\u2019re postponing tonight\u2019s livestream in order to keep the attention on the killing of George Floyd and the need for this country to end police violence. https://t.co/7nZchamxZv Donald Trump's attempt to exploit this tragedy for his own political gain is inexcusable. His penchant for authoritarianism and violence is more and more apparent.  Mr. President, don't encourage police officers to do more shooting. That is exactly the problem. Every officer involved in George Floyd's murder must be arrested and held criminally accountable. Going forward, the DOJ must independently investigate every time a person dies in police custody. That includes officers who passively stand by and allow these killings to happen. Having met with so many families brutalized by police violence, it's clear we cannot wait any longer to act forcefully and boldly to root out the cancer of systemic racism and police violence against people of color. This must end. Tonight, join me for a screening of \"The Revolutionist,\" a film on the life and times of Eugene Debs, with a panel discussion featuring @NicholsUprising and @mrdannyglover. Tune in at 8 p.m. ET at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/lDmSj3n0rK This is what unfettered capitalism is all about. In the past 30 years the top 1% increased its wealth by $21 trillion while the bottom 50% lost $900 billion \u2014 and the pandemic has only made the inequality worse. We need an economy that works for all, not just the few. At at time when millions of people are losing their jobs, the billionaire class should not be cashing in on a pandemic. That is what a rigged economy looks like. https://t.co/SXRy5b4Zq1 I find it particularly obscene that the people who make decisions that workers don\u2019t require protective equipment and sick time are sitting in mansions and don't have to go into work. https://t.co/hfa186gOP6 One in four workers filed for unemployment since the start of the pandemic, while in that time America's billionaires saw their wealth increase by nearly $500 billion. It's a disgrace and I'm little bit tired of people telling us there's nothing we can do about it. In the midst of a pandemic which has now claimed 100,000 Americans\u2019 lives, we're seeing the reality of Trump\u2019s so-called \u201cstrong economy.\u201d We cannot lose sight of our goal of an economic system that works for all people, not just the billionaire class. https://t.co/paMMBaMXor 100,000 are dead from coronavirus, 40 million apply for unemployment benefits, 20% of children are hungry, millions face eviction and lack health care. Meanwhile, Trump and Republican leadership don't see the \"urgency\" for new legislation to protect the working class. Outrageous! Real criminal justice reforms means not only that the DOJ investigates the tragic police killing in Minneapolis, but EVERY death that takes place in police custody.

Tune in at 8 p.m. ET on Friday at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS https://t.co/jULWVC6GTs What this pandemic has shown is that workers cannot survive on starvation wages. When half our people live paycheck to paycheck, and the paychecks stop coming in, poverty turns into desperation: hunger, homelessness and emotional despair. Every worker deserves a living wage. The global pandemic is pushing over half a billion people into poverty. Meanwhile the 25 richest people on Earth have increased their wealth by $255 billion. We need international solidarity. We must address the grotesque level of wealth inequality that's getting worse every day. Republicans make fun of Democrats who have political differences. Really? That's democracy. What is sad and dangerous is to see a Republican Party, including many who know better, surrender to the will and vindictiveness of their \"stable genius\" leader. That's authoritarianism. Today, Memorial Day, we honor the brave men and women who gave their lives to defend our country. Their sacrifices must not be forgotten. In their memory, we pledge to stand firm in defending American democracy against all who would undermine it. Today is a day for us to remember and cherish the many service members who died serving this nation and to acknowledge the unimaginable loss of their families and loved ones. Jane and I wish everyone a safe, peaceful and reflective #MemorialDay. Donald Trump is a bad president. He is a worse \"doctor.\" In the midst of a pandemic, he has ignored the advice of scientists and physicians and has peddled unsound and dangerous medical ideas. For the health and well-being of this country, Trump must be defeated. Eid Mubarak to all our Muslim friends. Wishing joy and prosperity to all who are celebrating. I've got some bad news for my Republican colleagues: No, we are not going to let you cut Social Security.

That is a bogus vision. Our job is to recognize our common humanity and ensure that all people live in dignity and security. Earning a paycheck shouldn't kill you. Tomorrow night: join our virtual town meeting at 7 p.m. ET on safely re-opening our economy, live at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/vXtYuDdktP What we have to do now is not complicated.

Yes. We should move to re-open the economy, but it must be done safely. We need strong federal guidelines based on science, not 50 states moving in different directions based on politics. Our campaign's statement on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to uphold a District Court ruling reinstating New York state\u2019s presidential primary: https://t.co/2XUejxPKIc The scandal of the moment is that we don't have national policy based on science, increasing testing, and dealing with the crises we face. Instead, we have a president who will blame everybody in the world for these problems except himself. https://t.co/JhFHy9zzwO Yes. We can and will re-open the economy, but it must be done safely. We don't need more bombast, lies and rhetoric from the White House. We don't need 50 states moving in different directions. We need a national policy which is based on science. Let's hope that, after clinical trials, this vaccine proves effective. If so, the government must negotiate a fair price with the company, and then distribute the vaccine free to all Americans. Nobody should die or get sick because they lack the money to buy a lifesaving vaccine. https://t.co/oSl6YNDtZd Before this crisis, half of our people lived paycheck to paycheck.\n\nTens of millions had no health insurance.\n\nSome 40 million people lived in poverty. 500,000 slept on the streets.\n\nWe cannot just go \"back to normal.\"\n\nWe must go forward and build an economy that works for all. People should not have to risk their lives and endanger their families to have income in a pandemic. One $1,200 check is not enough. We must ensure every person in this country receives $2,000 a month for the duration of this crisis. If there's anything I hope we learn out of this painful experience, it is that maybe we create an economy and a government that works for all, not just the few and wealthy campaign contributors.

Any Senate legislation to address the economic crisis must guarantee 100% of the paychecks of workers up to $90,000 a year. With over 80,000 COVID-19 deaths already, and more to come in the future, a future vaccine must be provided to all without cost. It would be morally unacceptable to allow the pharmaceutical industry to use this pandemic as another opportunity to make huge profits. Here's unfettered capitalism at work.

Watch at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/Q36vkpgh4s To prevent the collapse of the economy is far more humane and cost effective than rebuilding the economy after it collapses. During this crisis we must make sure workers stay on payroll and receive a paycheck. It is outrageous and unsustainable that we have a health care system which ties your health care to your employment. That has got to change. https://t.co/9PxP8tWolq For the duration of this emergency, the government should cover all the health care our people need with no out-of-pocket expenses. Then we continue fighting for Medicare for All. Now more than ever, we must understand that a health care should not be a privilege tied to employment status or income. Medicare for All means no one loses coverage. Period. There are people today who may well have symptoms of coronavirus, but who have to go to work because they don\u2019t have any paid family or medical leave. How does that happen in the richest country in the history of the world? I support @seiu200united and TCGPlayer warehouse workers work to organize a union.

Health care is a human right, not an employee benefit. Medicare for All! Just as other countries have, including the UK, Norway, and Denmark, we must make sure that every worker in America continues to receive their paycheck during this crisis, retroactive to the beginning of the crisis. I hope very much that out of this terrible tragedy we do some fundamental rethinking about the nature of American society. https://t.co/r8NqGx0tq4 In this unprecedented moment in modern American history, it is imperative that we respond in an unprecedented way.

This is a crisis. People don't know how they're going to afford to stay in their homes. We need to suspend rent and mortgage payments, evictions, and foreclosures nationwide. I support workers who strike, conduct a sick-out, or participate in a walk-off to support our collective health and safety amid this pandemic. Period.

The federal government must act now to make sure that every American has access to the food they need during this horrific pandemic. We cannot continue to have a dysfunctional, greedy health care system which ties most people's health care coverage to employment, leaves tens of millions uninsured and bankrupts over 500,000 people a year.\n\nWe must guarantee health care as a human right through Medicare for All. Under Medicare for All, rural hospitals would finally have consistent funding rather than being forced into closure based on the business models of profit-seeking health insurers. The Federal Reserve estimates that upwards of 47 million people could lose their jobs.\n \nThat means tens of millions losing insurance in addition to the 30 million already uninsured.\n \nUnder Medicare for All, no one would lose their health insurance if they lost their job. While there is no simple health care fix to the destruction of coronavirus, under a Medicare for All system, everyone would have comprehensive health care free at the point of service. No one would avoid going to the doctor due to cost, or go into debt just for getting sick. We must never forget that we are only as healthy as the least insured among us. When one of us gets sick, all of us have the potential to get sick. When our neighbor loses their job, that hurts our community and local economy. The coronavirus pandemic is highlighting every day the many ways in which our country leaves the poor and vulnerable behind.\n\nMillions of workers have no paid leave.\n\nHalf our people live paycheck to paycheck.\n \nAnd 87 million are uninsured or underinsured. People shouldn't have to put their lives on the line to vote. Wisconsin should join the 15 states delaying elections, delay Tuesday\u2019s vote, extend early voting, and work to send every voter a ballot by mail.

Our current economy, which allows for a grotesque level of income and wealth inequality and forces half of our people to live paycheck-to-paycheck, must be replaced by an economy that works for all, not just the few. There is no excuse for the wealthiest nation on Earth not to be prepared to have adequate test kits for a pandemic, or have the protective masks, gloves and gowns our medical personnel require. Our dysfunctional health care system must be replaced by a Medicare for All, single-payer system, which not only guarantees health care for everyone as a right, but has a strong public health component which prepares our country for health care crises like the coronavirus. Now is the time. \n\nThe unprecedented crises we are living in call for an unprecedented response. \n\nIf there is any silver lining in the horrific situation we now find ourselves in, it is the need to understand how we got here and how we can prevent future disasters like this.

For far too long, the federal government has adopted policies that take land away from tribes, ignore treaty rights and interfere with tribal management of their own resources.
