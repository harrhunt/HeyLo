We have 49 days to go before Election Day. Let us defeat Trump, elect progressives and reverse the incredible damage that has been done to our nation. These reports are simply horrifying. They must be investigated by Congress and anyone responsible must be held accountable for these disturbing acts. We must dismantle ICE and CBP and create an immigration system based on justice, not cruelty and human rights violations. https://t.co/N9tDFN5V5X The United States of America is the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care, paid family and medical leave, paid sick days and a paid vacation.

Since 1975, there has been a h-u-g-e redistribution of income in America, but it has gone in the wrong direction.

Unbelievably\u2014as the West Coast burns amidst record-breaking temperature\u2014Trump continues to deny the reality of climate change.

We need to end their greed. https://t.co/NTnUVMlurt Tens of millions of Americans are facing hunger, eviction and joblessness. They are frightened that they will soon lose their homes to eviction and not be able to feed their families. We cannot abandon them.

Congress must act to protect workers. Strong unions mean decent wages and a strong middle class.\n\nCongress must make it easier for workers to join unions and engage in collective bargaining.\n\nWe must end the heavy-handed corporate tactics that prevent workers from unionizing.

On this Labor Day let us not forget that over the last 30 years the top 1% have seen a $22 trillion increase in their wealth, while the bottom half of the American people have actually seen a decline in their wealth.

But, we must also stay vigilant, and do everything possible to prevent Trump from staying in power if he loses. Nothing less than our democracy is at stake. Fourth, we need Congressional hearings with local officials to learn how they plan to handle the Election Day process and the days that follow. Every agency of government\u2014federal, state and local\u2014must do everything possible to ensure that we have a free and fair election. Third, social media companies must finally get their act together and stop people from using their tools to threaten and harass election officials, spread disinformation, and organize voter intimidation and disinformation on their sites. Second, the news media needs to prepare the American people to understand there is no longer a single Election Day and that we may not know the results on November 3. Absent a national conversation about that reality, conspiracy theories and disinformation will likely thrive. First, with the pandemic and a massive increase in mail-in voting, state legislatures must take action to allow votes to be counted before Election Day. We must avoid a situation where battleground states are counting millions of votes for days and weeks after Election Day. We must do everything we can to ensure @JoeBiden wins by the largest possible margin. We also must consider what happens if Trump loses but refuses to abide by the results and does everything he can to hold onto power.

In the richest country on Earth no one should suddenly lose their health insurance, let alone during a pandemic. It's outrageous that our corporate-run system treats health insurance as an employee benefit, not a right. We must end that disgrace and pass Medicare for All. https://t.co/pFR93cNCm6 Trump claims he's a \"law and order\" president. That's funny. This is a president who shamelessly violates the Constitution, incites violence, uses his office to enrich his family, and seven of his top campaign advisers have been criminally charged (so far). Trump must go. Mr. President, your job is to discourage violence, not incite it. Trump\u2019s proposal to permanently terminate the payroll tax could defund Social Security and eliminate benefits for senior citizens and people with disabilities in &lt;4 years. That\u2019s not Bernie Sanders talking. That\u2019s what the Social Security Administration recently reported to us. Three months ago the House responded to the enormous pain and suffering of the American people by passing a $3.5 trillion relief package.\n\nWhat has McConnell and the Republican-led Senate done since then?\n\nNothing except pass a bloated Pentagon budget and take a vacation.

Thank you to the many, many people who are showing up and carrying forward the fight for racial justice. Mr. President, if you believe in the American people and our way of life so much, tell them tonight that you are prepared to leave office when you lose. Democracy \u2013 that\u2019s what America is about. #PromisesBroken Mr. President, if you love the American people so much, why are you trying to divide us up based on the color of our skin, our gender, our country of origin and our religion? #PromisesBroken Yes, this is the most important election in history. And you are the most dangerous president in the history of our country. That\u2019s why you\u2019re going to lose. #PromisesBroken Trump promised he would provide \"health insurance to everybody.\" But he is now in court actively trying to take health insurance away from 32 million Americans and eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions during a global pandemic. #PromisesBroken One more lie. Trump's budget cuts Medicare by $845 billion and he promised to defund Social Security by permanently terminating the payroll tax. #PromisesBroken According to documented sources, Trump has made 20,000 lies and distortions while in office, and that is before this speech. Will he ever stop lying to the American people? #PromisesBroken I don\u2019t know if this is a record, maybe the last \u201cLaw and Order\u201d president Richard Nixon beat it, but seven of Trump\u2019s top campaign advisers have been criminally charged \u2026 so far. #PromisesBroken 400,000 Americans should not be kept in jail for the \u201ccrime\u201d of being poor and unable to afford bail. #PromisesBroken Yes, Mr. President, it is the women of this country who control their own bodies, not you. #PromisesBroken Here is the Trump manifesto: a government of lies, corruption, greed and rejection of science. #PromisesBroken Trump promised that \u201cthe rich would not be gaining at all\u201d under his tax plan. But the tax bill he signed into law provides 83% of the benefits to the top 1% while raising taxes on 92 million Americans by the end of the decade. #PromisesBroken Stop the lies. Doctors and nurses today still don\u2019t have the masks, gowns and gloves they need to protect themselves and our lives. #PromisesBroken Yes, Trump wants to spend billions on a Space Force, but half a million Americans are homeless and 45 million Americans have student debt. Let's get our priorities right. Invest in working Americans, Mr. President. #PromisesBroken In Michigan, there are 57,000 fewer manufacturing jobs than when Trump took office.\n\nIn Wisconsin, there are 11,000 fewer manufacturing jobs than when Trump took office.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, there are today 25,000 less manufacturing jobs than when Trump took office. #PromisesBroken Trump: Abraham Lincoln. \nFox: News. Trump took away the legal rights of the 1.8 million young people eligible for DACA. That is an outrage. Those rights must be restored. #PromisesBroken This is a president who said he was going to \"drain the swamp,\" but has used his office for blatant personal and political gain, running the most corrupt administration in modern American history. #PromisesBroken Trump just LOVES socialism when it\u2019s his family feeding at the trough for $885 million in government subsidies and tax breaks to build a real-estate empire on racial discrimination. #PromisesBroken Trump's rejection of science has contributed to the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Americans. We need a president who believes in science. #PromisesBroken Remember the state of the economy before the pandemic?\n\nHalf of Americans lived paycheck to paycheck\n40% of adults didn't have $400 for an emergency\n87 million uninsured or underinsured\n41 million workers made under $15/hour\n\nNope. That was not a \"great economy.\"\n\n#PromisesBroken At a time when California is on fire, when Hurricane Laura is doing devastating harm, when is Trump going to get to the part when he tells us that climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese? #PromisesBroken We have a president whose contempt for the law is so clear that he holds a political rally at the White House. #PromisesBroken We need to protect our democracy and stop the slide into oligarchy. Join @JulieOliverTX, @RepRoKhanna, @ZephyrTeachout, and @Tiffany_Muller for a live roundtable about getting corporate money out of politics: https://t.co/kyRxObpHoB Trump has betrayed the working people of this country and our job tonight, and in the next 68 days, is to expose him for the fraud and pathological liar that he is. I hope to see you while I live-tweet his speech later tonight. #PromisesBroken Trump promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. That was another whopper. His budgets proposed slashing all three and his \u201cpayroll tax holiday\u201d is designed to bankrupt Social Security and Medicare. #PromisesBroken Trump said he'd stand up for working families, yet today the rich are getting much richer and there is more income and wealth inequality than any time since the 1920s. Three people now own more wealth than the bottom half of our nation. #PromisesBroken Trump promised to provide health care \u201cto everyone,\u201d yet has tried to throw 32 million people off their health insurance. Today, millions more people have no health insurance than when Trump came into office. #PromisesBroken Let the prebuttal begin! Watching Trump tonight will be hard because you just can't keep up with all the lies. But I will be watching and live-tweeting, hoping he will apologize to the American people for his #PromisesBroken. It's unacceptable that the 4 richest men in the U.S. now own a record-breaking $542 billion in wealth while 92 million Americans are uninsured or under-insured. It's time to tax the windfall profits of these billionaires and expand Medicare to all. I strongly support the NBA, WNBA and MLB players who are striking for racial justice. Real change takes place when people come together and demand it. It is time for the police who shot Jacob Blake seven times in the back to be fired, arrested and prosecuted. Now. Hurricane Laura producing an unsurvivable storm surge in Texas and Louisiana. A catastrophic 800-mile derecho in Iowa and Illinois. Raging wildfires in California. No. The Green New Deal is not radical. Having a president in office who calls climate change a hoax\u2014that's radical. When Trump says \"America will never become a socialist country,\" remember: his New York real estate empire would be worth nothing without $885 million in government grants, subsidies and tax breaks. Trump l-o-v-e-s corporate socialism for himself, rugged capitalism for the rest.

While Trump and the Republican Senate denied hazard pay to essential workers, their tax plan allowed Amazon to pay nothing in federal income taxes after making $29 billion in profits. Yes.

This is an election on the future of American democracy. https://t.co/9vOtftuA15 We must fight back against Trump's efforts to destroy USPS.

We must stand up to the fossil fuel industry and end their greed.

If there's going to be a class war in this country, it's time the working class won that war. We can no longer tolerate 3 billionaires owning more wealth than the bottom 50%. We must tax the obscene gains billionaires made in the pandemic and create an economy that works for all. California is on fire. Once in a lifetime hurricanes are sweeping the Gulf Coast. The Arctic topped 100 degrees. The future of our planet is at stake this election. We can no longer have a president in office who rejects science and calls climate change a hoax. #GreenNewDeal Never forget. While the Republican Senate refused to extend $600/week for 30 million unemployed workers, it had no problem passing a $1 trillion tax break to the top 1% and large corporations. Trump and the Republicans love socialism for the rich, rugged capitalism for the rest. How absurd. Now, Trump believes he's not only smarter than scientists, but that they are actively plotting against his re-election. We need a president who listens to scientists, not someone who concocts bizarre conspiracy theories. The \"very stable genius\" must be defeated. https://t.co/389bCXKxWa While 92 million can't afford health care, the 4 richest Americans are now worth $512.8 billion:\n\n- Jeff Bezos: $193 billion\n- Bill Gates: $122 billion\n- Mark Zuckerberg: $101 billion\n- Elon Musk: $96.8 billion\n\nIt's time to tax the billionaire class and expand Medicare to all.

A cruel system that causes 92 million Americans to be uninsured or under-insured during a pandemic, while the health care industry made $54.6 billion in profits during the last quarter alone. That's radical. Every year we see more extreme weather disasters.

Support democracy. https://t.co/yMRV2e2fqz The fact that Republicans took away $600 a week in unemployment benefits for 30 million Americans while 467 billionaires made $730 billion during a global pandemic is the real looting in America that we must end. #MakeBillionairesPay You all who supported candidates like @CoriBush, @RashidaTlaib and @JamaalBowmanNY, your work got these people elected. They inspire me and they are inspiring the American people. https://t.co/xJTiDj2PPR How has this pandemic and economic crisis affected your ability to afford rent, utilities, food or health care? Wealth gains by billionaires during the pandemic:\n\nJeff Bezos: +$71 billion\nWalton Family: +$21 billion\nMark Zuckerberg: +$38 billion\n\nBy taxing 60% of the wealth gains by 467 billionaires, we could cover all out-of-pocket health care costs for a year. \"For all the corporate bullies and corporations that think they\u2019re going to make government about them, there\u2019s a bunch of us coming. Our squad is getting bigger and bigger.\u201d - @RashidaTlaib https://t.co/juSLwnHXKP Progressives are not just fighting for the right things. We are prepared to take on powerful special interests. \n\nWe know and have always known that real change never takes place without struggle. No one gives you anything. You\u2019ve got to fight for it. https://t.co/90glOdFaq7 Our movement gets stronger every day. Join me now for a livestream with @CoriBush, @RashidaTlaib and @JamaalBowmanNY to discuss their historic victories and the next steps for our movement. https://t.co/jmRBTNLG8P It is time for the Senate to act on behalf of the working class who are hurting like they have never hurt before, not the billionaire class who are doing phenomenally well and have never had it so good. We have a choice to make. We can continue to allow the very rich to get much richer while everyone else gets poorer and poorer. Or we can tax the winnings a handful of billionaires made during the pandemic to improve the health and well-being of tens of millions of Americans. In my view, we can no longer tolerate the three wealthiest people in America owning more wealth than the bottom 50 percent, while over 30 million Americans have lost their jobs and 92 million people are either uninsured or under-insured. Yes, by taxing 60% of the wealth gains made by just 467 billionaires during this pandemic, we could guarantee health care as a right for an entire year. And billionaires would still be able to pocket over $310 billion in gains during the worst downturn since the Great Depression. If we taxed 60% of the windfall gains 467 billionaires made from March 18th until August 3rd we could raise over $420 billion. That\u2019s enough revenue to allow Medicare to pay all of the out-of-pocket health care expenses for everyone in America over the next 12 months. At a time of massive wealth and income inequality, when so many our people are hurting, it is morally obscene for billionaires to use a global pandemic as an opportunity to make outrageous profits. While millions of Americans are lining up at emergency food banks because they don\u2019t have enough money to put food on the table, Mark Zuckerberg the founder of Facebook has increased his wealth by more than $37 billion during the pandemic and is now worth over $90 billion. While 40 million Americans face eviction, Elon Musk has nearly tripled his wealth over the past four months and now has a net worth of more than $70 billion. While U.S. taxpayers are subsidizing the starvation wages at Walmart, our nation\u2019s largest private employer, the Walton family has made over $20 billion during the pandemic and now has a net worth of over $200 billion. While Amazon is denying paid sick leave, hazard pay and personal protective equipment to 450,000 of its workers, Jeff Bezos has increased his wealth by over $70 billion. Let me give you a few examples of the incredible growth in inequality that is taking place during this horrific pandemic. In the midst of a president undermining democracy and moving us toward an authoritarian government, in the midst of all of that, we are seeing a massive increase in income and wealth inequality and the movement in this country toward oligarchy. In other words, in the midst of a pandemic, in the midst of an economic meltdown for working families, in the midst of a great struggle regarding systemic racism and police brutality, in the midst of the existential threat of climate change... In all likelihood, in the midst of everything else, we are currently witnessing what is likely the greatest transfer of wealth from the middle class and the poor to the very rich in the modern history of this country. Meanwhile, during the last four months, while the very, very rich have become much richer, American households have seen their wealth go down by $6.5 trillion. Let me repeat that. 467 billionaires have seen their wealth go up by over $730 billion during the pandemic. While over 30 million Americans have seen their $600 a week in unemployment benefits expire, emergency actions taken by the Federal Reserve to prop up the stock market have meant that 467 billionaires saw their wealth go up by over $730 billion since the pandemic began. What I think many people do not fully understand is that not everyone is hurting in America.  Not everyone needs the Senate to act. I will be introducing legislation tomorrow to tax the obscene wealth gains billionaires have made during the public health crisis. .@RepRabhi\u2019s big win means he will continue to lead the charge for the state\u2019s universal health care bill and renewable energy plan in the Michigan House of Representatives.\n\nCongratulations all on your victories! https://t.co/wyUgG05AOm From Medicare for All and a $15 minimum wage to a Green New Deal and college for all, we are lucky to have @AbrahamAiyash fighting for our agenda in Michigan. https://t.co/NBu0ym95zS Voters are demanding real criminal justice reform, and they proved it by propelling @kdmcdonald2020 to a huge victory over the incumbent prosecutor in Oakland County, Michigan. https://t.co/RIfmzexLBN .@EliNSavit ran and won a progressive platform to take on the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s greed and corruption, and to protect tenants and consumers when their rights are violated. https://t.co/zbgcCQsqke The people of Missouri voted to expand Medicaid, saying clearly that nobody should go without health care.

The truth is, despite the opposition of powerful special interests, we are transforming American politics. The political revolution is gaining more and more support. All across this country, from coast to coast, people are standing up and fighting back \u2014 not only against Trump, but for an agenda that works for the working families of this country. Progressives are on the move. Reps. @RashidaTlaib and @PramilaJayapal last night won landslide re-election victories, and @CoriBush scored an incredible upset win in Missouri. So what do these victories say about the current moment? Congratulations to @PramilaJayapal on her huge victory last night.

Trump's \"handling\" of the pandemic has cost us tens of thousands of lives. For the health and safety of America, Trump must be defeated. LIVE NOW: I'm joining @PplsAction to talk about why we need a huge voter turnout to defeat Donald Trump and transform our country so it works for all of us. https://t.co/rYm9xRWJSi 10. Donald Trump is hostile to the LGBTQ community. 9. Donald Trump is a religious bigot. 8. Donald Trump is a sexist. 7. Donald Trump is a xenophobe. 6. Donald Trump is a racist. 5. Donald Trump's policies benefit his billionaire friends, while attacking the needs of working families. 4. Donald Trump does not believe in science. 3. Donald Trump is a pathological liar. 2. Donald Trump does not understand or respect the Constitution of the United States. 1. Donald Trump is, at his core, an authoritarian leader who does not believe in democracy. I want to give you ten reasons (and there are many more) as to why, together, we have got to do everything we can to create the largest voter turnout in history and send Trump packing. This is a no-brainer. Masks are not a political or partisan issue. Providing all of our people with high-quality, reusable masks without cost will save tens of thousands of lives and save our economy billions of dollars. https://t.co/iihyD3m6Pb Defeating Donald Trump and transforming this country is going to require a historic voter turnout.\n\nTonight I\u2019m joining @PplsAction, a leading organization in this fight, for the Rise Up 2020 Get Out The Vote Launch.

The time to act is now. https://t.co/stUzMQuI5I And the very rich get much richer. Over half of American households have lost income during the pandemic, while 491 billionaires have increased their wealth by $743 billion. This is obscene. We need an economy that works for all, not a rigged economy for the wealthy and powerful. The clock is ticking. While the economy tanks, some 30 million workers are losing their $600 a week unemployment supplement. Their families are facing hunger, eviction and foreclosure. The House has acted. The Senate must act NOW. The U.S. economy shrank a record-breaking 33% in the second quarter. How many more Americans have to lose their jobs, health insurance and housing before the do-nothing Senate acts to protect the working class?\n\nExtend unemployment, pass $2,000 monthly payments &amp; cancel rent now. The House passed legislation to extend the expanded unemployment program on May 15.\n\nThat was 78 days ago.\n\nBut Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans refused to act. Now, 30 million Americans are scrambling to make ends meet. The Republicans must get their act together. Sad but not surprising. The Senate GOP chose to let $600 a week in unemployment benefits expire for 30 million Americans, but had no problem giving the Pentagon another $740 billion. We need new national priorities.

This week the Senate must pass a bill to fully extend unemployment benefits, provide a $2,000 monthly stipend and guarantee health care for the length of the crisis. In the richest nation in the world, people are forced to risk their lives for starvation wages. That is a moral outrage. Every worker deserves a living wage and a safe workplace, especially in the middle of a deadly pandemic. https://t.co/Vf6c4Enclo The U.S.A. is the only major country not to guarantee health care to all. If you're wealthy you can buy excellent care. If you're poor or working class, tough luck. You die younger and experience more illness and pain. Health care is a human right. We need Medicare for All. Amidst the many crises we face, we cannot ignore that the climate crisis is getting worse. Now is the time to end our dependence on fossil fuels and move to renewable energy. Now is the time for a Green New Deal. https://t.co/MBQ1S6vdKY Against the wishes of state and local officials, unmarked federal agents in combat gear have invaded parts of Portland, Oregon. This is what a police state looks like.  These troops must be withdrawn immediately. We must defend the Constitution. We must defeat Trump. Let\u2019s use the Defense Production Act and get every American the masks they need. https://t.co/lj9jErLNqY John Lewis inspired millions to fight for justice. His courage helped transform this country. He won\u2019t ever be forgotten by those who believe America can change when the people stand together and demand it. Our thoughts are with his loved ones. In Portland, federal agents in combat gear pulled protesters off the street and jailed them without charge. That is what a police state is all about. Now is the time to defend our Constitution. Now is the time to come together and defeat Trump's authoritarian policies. https://t.co/fZn1hrk4YE We must reduce the military budget by 10% and use that $74 billion in savings to invest in communities ravaged by extreme poverty, mass incarceration, decades of neglect and the COVID-19 pandemic. https://t.co/Ud15Y9BOGG In 2018, Floridians overwhelmingly voted to re-enfranchise felons. The outrageous poll tax passed in response to that referendum is racist voter suppression at its worst. Voting is a right, not a privilege. These attacks on Americans\u2019 constitutional rights have got to end. https://t.co/oWgbz4NCLg It's time to rethink what we value as a society and to fundamentally transform our national priorities. \n\nCutting the military budget by 10% and investing that money in human needs is a modest way to begin that process.\n\nLet's get it done.\nhttps://t.co/J5GY8NfASn Congratulations to @JamaalBowmanNY for winning the congressional primary in NY-16!

He must be defeated. https://t.co/XgIGtRrnKl While 29 new people in America became billionaires, 119 million Americans have seen their income go down. While Americans pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, Gilead is charging more than $3,000 for a COVID-19 drug that costs $10 to manufacture and was developed after receiving a $70 million grant from the federal government. While Amazon refuses to provide paid sick leave to its workers and recently eliminated hazard pay for essential workers, the owner of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, has seen his wealth go up by $74 billion making him the wealthiest person in America with a net worth of $179 billion. While American households have lost $6.5 trillion in wealth and 50 million Americans have filed for unemployment, the wealth of 600 billionaires in America has gone up by $584 billion. While one out of five Americans cannot afford the medicine prescribed by their doctors, the CEO of Moderna became a billionaire overnight after his company received $483 million from the Trump administration to develop a potential coronavirus vaccine. While 28 million Americans are in danger of being evicted from their homes and thrown out on the street, JP Morgan Chase posted a record-breaking $33.8 billion in quarterly revenue. During the pandemic, while a record-breaking 5.4 million Americans lost their health insurance, UnitedHealth\u2014one of the largest health insurance companies in America\u2014made a record-breaking quarterly profit of $6.6 billion. Pharmaceutical companies have been given $6 billion in taxpayer dollars, and more to come, to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Once a safe and effective vaccine is approved by the FDA it must be made available to all for free. This is no time for profiteering. Don't let anybody fool you.

But it is important that we maintain our vision and continue to fight. https://t.co/RXOIZUJpx9 The fact that our \"very stable genius\" president prefers to be briefed about the pandemic by a game show host on Twitter instead of scientists and doctors tells you everything you need to know about how clueless and pathetic the Trump administration is. Trump must be defeated. https://t.co/wruxHuAI8A As the pandemic surges, Trump is more clueless, isolated and unhinged than ever.

Too little too late. \n\nHis refusal to develop national pandemic policy based on science has led to widespread confusion and cost us many thousands of lives. \n\nTrump has rejected science. In November, we must come together and reject Trump. Trump commutes Roger Stone's sentence, while Black and Brown kids sit in jail. This is why we need major reform of a broken and racist criminal justice system. No more two-tier justice. Rich or poor, Black, white or Latino \u2014 we need \"equal justice under law.\" Mitt Romney and I hold different opinions on virtually everything. But I agree with him strongly that Trump's commutation of Roger Stone's sentence is \"unprecedented, historic corruption.\" The key political question of our time is: Where are all the other Republicans? It's summer. It's hot. It's vacation time. Sadly, the U.S. is the only major country not to guarantee any paid vacation or holidays. The result: 1 in 4 workers get no paid vacation time or holidays. This is outrageous. We need an economy that works for workers, not just owners. We can keep winning races and electing progressives around the country, but we need your help.

In the midst of all the other crises we face, we cannot forget climate change. We must transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. Now! Congratulations to the many Native Americans and advocates who struggled to defeat this terrible pipeline, which should never have been built. We must end our dependence on fossil fuels and stop putting corporate profits over Native American rights. The struggle continues. https://t.co/p03f3IEU4g Politicians and the corporate media won't discuss it much but over the past 30 years the wealth of the top 1% has gone up by $22.65 trillion, while the wealth of the bottom 50% has gone down by $776 billion. This growing wealth inequality is a moral obscenity. We need to stop bipartisan support for a bloated military budget. While defense contractors make huge profits and we spend more on the military than the next 11 nations combined, doctors and nurses lack masks to help us fight COVID-19. Insane priorities. We spend $740 billion on the Pentagon, but somehow we don't have enough money to provide health care, housing and childcare to all Americans. My amendment to cut the defense budget by 10% would begin to change our priorities. It will be voted on in the Senate the week of July 20. \u201cWe need elected leaders who are going to stand for what is morally right. Who are going to stand up for humanity.

One way to help save lives and prevent illness is for Congress to pass my amendment which calls for the production and distribution of free, high-quality masks for every American household. Just when you think Trump cannot be more vile or racist, he outdoes himself. This morning he shared a video in which a supporter of his yells, \"white power.\" Let us stand together and make certain that this \"stable genius\" is defeated, and defeated badly, in November. When we say we have a rigged economy, that means billionaires getting richer during a pandemic while millions of people lose their jobs every week. https://t.co/gHFZktDv8o We need to cut our military budget by 10 percent and invest that money in human needs.

We must create a society that values and celebrates Black Americans. That is not the work of a single day, but of every day and every generation. Understanding the horrors and lasting legacy of slavery is a critical step to making the changes we need in our world today, and that is why I believe we must make Juneteenth a federal holiday. It is at once beautiful to see millions of people fighting for change, and heartbreaking that more than 150 years after the first Juneteenth celebration, Black Americans still face fundamental challenges to living in safety and dignity in this country. Today is an opportunity to confront the systemic, institutionalized racism at the heart of America, as we see unprecedented levels of protests and activism across the country calling for an end to all forms of racism and violence toward Black Americans. As we celebrate #Juneteenth today and commemorate the abolition of slavery in the United States, we face a transformative moment for our nation and our world that cannot be ignored.

We need real police department reform. Every police officer involved in a killing must be held accountable, and those found guilty must be punished with the full force of the law.  Every killing of a person held in police custody must be investigated by the Department of Justice. George Floyd\u2019s murder is not only an outrage.

His penchant for authoritarianism and violence is more and more apparent.  Mr. President, don't encourage police officers to do more shooting. That is exactly the problem. Every officer involved in George Floyd's murder must be arrested and held criminally accountable. Going forward, the DOJ must independently investigate every time a person dies in police custody. That includes officers who passively stand by and allow these killings to happen.

Tune in at 8 p.m. ET on Friday at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS https://t.co/jULWVC6GTs What this pandemic has shown is that workers cannot survive on starvation wages. When half our people live paycheck to paycheck, and the paychecks stop coming in, poverty turns into desperation: hunger, homelessness and emotional despair. Every worker deserves a living wage. The global pandemic is pushing over half a billion people into poverty. Meanwhile the 25 richest people on Earth have increased their wealth by $255 billion. We need international solidarity. We must address the grotesque level of wealth inequality that's getting worse every day. Republicans make fun of Democrats who have political differences. Really? That's democracy. What is sad and dangerous is to see a Republican Party, including many who know better, surrender to the will and vindictiveness of their \"stable genius\" leader. That's authoritarianism. Today, Memorial Day, we honor the brave men and women who gave their lives to defend our country. Their sacrifices must not be forgotten. In their memory, we pledge to stand firm in defending American democracy against all who would undermine it. Today is a day for us to remember and cherish the many service members who died serving this nation and to acknowledge the unimaginable loss of their families and loved ones. Jane and I wish everyone a safe, peaceful and reflective #MemorialDay. Donald Trump is a bad president. He is a worse \"doctor.\" In the midst of a pandemic, he has ignored the advice of scientists and physicians and has peddled unsound and dangerous medical ideas. For the health and well-being of this country, Trump must be defeated. Eid Mubarak to all our Muslim friends. Wishing joy and prosperity to all who are celebrating. I've got some bad news for my Republican colleagues: No, we are not going to let you cut Social Security. At a time when half of older Americans have no retirement savings, our job must be to expand Social Security, not cut it.\nhttps://t.co/SdQi7tNgcx On June 3rd, we will be holding A People's Graduation to honor all the graduates and hear from the young people themselves.

They oppose raising the minimum wage and making it easier for workers to join unions. Now, they want to end extended unemployment benefits. Stand up and fight back for human dignity.

Once that vaccine is approved by the FDA, it must be available to all for free. We've already paid for it. This is not a time for pharmaceutical industry profiteering. Why are Republican leaders so concerned over the $600 a week supplement to unemployment benefits? Because they don\u2019t want a precedent established where workers understand that they\u2019re entitled to and deserve decent, livable wages. https://t.co/yHP2993jmu The pandemic and economic collapse has hit almost everybody, but it is especially hard for young people. Now is the time to accelerate the fight for a guaranteed federal jobs program, making public colleges and universities tuition-free, and canceling all student debt.

That is a bogus vision. Our job is to recognize our common humanity and ensure that all people live in dignity and security. Earning a paycheck shouldn't kill you. Tomorrow night: join our virtual town meeting at 7 p.m. ET on safely re-opening our economy, live at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/vXtYuDdktP What we have to do now is not complicated.

Throughout our history, millions of men and women have fought and died to protect our democracy. We will not allow Trump to undermine that sacred American principle. https://t.co/mhYlH8vHHA Nobody in America should delay getting medical help because of the cost\u2014especially during this crisis.

Yes. We should move to re-open the economy, but it must be done safely. We need strong federal guidelines based on science, not 50 states moving in different directions based on politics. Our campaign's statement on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision to uphold a District Court ruling reinstating New York state\u2019s presidential primary: https://t.co/2XUejxPKIc The scandal of the moment is that we don't have national policy based on science, increasing testing, and dealing with the crises we face. Instead, we have a president who will blame everybody in the world for these problems except himself. https://t.co/JhFHy9zzwO Yes. We can and will re-open the economy, but it must be done safely. We don't need more bombast, lies and rhetoric from the White House. We don't need 50 states moving in different directions. We need a national policy which is based on science. Let's hope that, after clinical trials, this vaccine proves effective. If so, the government must negotiate a fair price with the company, and then distribute the vaccine free to all Americans. Nobody should die or get sick because they lack the money to buy a lifesaving vaccine. https://t.co/oSl6YNDtZd Before this crisis, half of our people lived paycheck to paycheck.\n\nTens of millions had no health insurance.\n\nSome 40 million people lived in poverty. 500,000 slept on the streets.\n\nWe cannot just go \"back to normal.\"\n\nWe must go forward and build an economy that works for all. People should not have to risk their lives and endanger their families to have income in a pandemic. One $1,200 check is not enough. We must ensure every person in this country receives $2,000 a month for the duration of this crisis. If there's anything I hope we learn out of this painful experience, it is that maybe we create an economy and a government that works for all, not just the few and wealthy campaign contributors. It\u2019s incomprehensible to me that we have Republican leadership and a president who refuse to recognize the severity of the pain people are experiencing right now. https://t.co/U6H3gXQKHg RT @ABCPolitics: \u201cThis president thinks he\u2019s above the law, he\u2019s above criticism.

If that doesn\u2019t demonstrate our rigged economy I don\u2019t know what does. It is catastrophic that tens of millions of Americans are losing their health insurance\u2014on top of the millions already uninsured. \n\nMedicare must be empowered to cover all health care expenses during this crisis. \n\nWe can not abandon the American people.

If we are going to avoid another Great Depression, it is imperative that every worker in this country continues to receive a paycheck and benefits. Any Senate legislation to address the economic crisis must guarantee 100% of the paychecks of workers up to $90,000 a year. With over 80,000 COVID-19 deaths already, and more to come in the future, a future vaccine must be provided to all without cost. It would be morally unacceptable to allow the pharmaceutical industry to use this pandemic as another opportunity to make huge profits. Here's unfettered capitalism at work. Jeff Bezos, the owner of Amazon, has increased his wealth by $30 billion during the pandemic. His response: end the hazard pay increases that Amazon warehouse workers have received, despite hundreds of them being infected with the virus.

Then we continue fighting for Medicare for All. Now more than ever, we must understand that a health care should not be a privilege tied to employment status or income.

We cannot continue to have a dysfunctional, greedy health care system which ties most people's health care coverage to employment, leaves tens of millions uninsured and bankrupts over 500,000 people a year.\n\nWe must guarantee health care as a human right through Medicare for All. Under Medicare for All, rural hospitals would finally have consistent funding rather than being forced into closure based on the business models of profit-seeking health insurers. The Federal Reserve estimates that upwards of 47 million people could lose their jobs.\n \nThat means tens of millions losing insurance in addition to the 30 million already uninsured.\n \nUnder Medicare for All, no one would lose their health insurance if they lost their job. While there is no simple health care fix to the destruction of coronavirus, under a Medicare for All system, everyone would have comprehensive health care free at the point of service. No one would avoid going to the doctor due to cost, or go into debt just for getting sick. We must never forget that we are only as healthy as the least insured among us. When one of us gets sick, all of us have the potential to get sick. When our neighbor loses their job, that hurts our community and local economy. The coronavirus pandemic is highlighting every day the many ways in which our country leaves the poor and vulnerable behind.\n\nMillions of workers have no paid leave.\n\nHalf our people live paycheck to paycheck.\n \nAnd 87 million are uninsured or underinsured.

There is no excuse for the wealthiest nation on Earth not to be prepared to have adequate test kits for a pandemic, or have the protective masks, gloves and gowns our medical personnel require.

If our medical personnel go down, who will treat the American people? Mr. Trump: Utilize the Defense Production Act and protect our medical personnel. https://t.co/xh5gpuxidB Corporate-run health insurance isn't about saving lives. It's about making as much money as possible. With Medicare for All we can finally put an end to this international disgrace. https://t.co/sZrb6FcUPz We need a clean Carcieri fix to reaffirm the authority of the Secretary of the Interior to take land into trust for all federally recognized Indian tribes. A Sanders administration will prioritize that. We must reset the partnership between the federal government and Tribal Nations by putting land \u2013 and control of that land \u2013 back in the hands of tribes. For far too long, the federal government has adopted policies that take land away from tribes, ignore treaty rights and interfere with tribal management of their own resources. I stand with the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe in their fight to restore lands that belong to them, and I oppose the disgraceful decision by the Trump Administration to disestablish their lands held in trust by the Department of Interior. https://t.co/pNH2YUH00D Using this health and economic crisis to union bust is morally unacceptable.

People need help NOW, not in several months. Losing your job and being unemployed is difficult enough. You shouldn\u2019t lose your health insurance too. Medicare for All means always being covered.

The president must immediately and forcefully use the Defense Production Act to direct manufacturers to produce all of the personal protective equipment, ventilators, and other medical supplies that we need to get through this crisis. Unbelievably, in the U.S. right now, doctors and nurses are unnecessarily putting their lives on the line treating people suffering from the coronavirus because they lack personal protective equipment like masks, gloves, and surgical gowns.\n\nThat is unacceptable.

Trump is going to be a formidable opponent. But despair is not an option. We are going to organize, bring millions of people into the political process, and win. Have you put off buying a home or starting a family due to medical debt or student\u00a0loans? Teachers are doing some of the most important work in the entire country. They should not be scraping by and taking two or three jobs. They should be paid at least $60,000 a year. There are a lot of lies peddled by the insurance and drug industries about Medicare for All.\n\nDon't believe them.\n\nHere is the truth: Medicare for All will save the American people money and end the disgrace of our profit-driven system. https://t.co/6BtIf3JVgt We must become a nation where all our people are able to live long and healthy lives\u2014not just those with the means to afford outrageous health care costs. Taxpayers have paid $115 million so Donald Trump could play golf at his own resorts.\n\nAmazon got $129 million in tax rebates last year.\n\nMeanwhile, the average person in poverty gets just $134 a month in nutrition assistance.\n\nThis is what a rigged economy looks like. Wishing a peaceful and merry Christmas from myself, Jane, and our family to all those who are celebrating. Millions of undocumented people in America should not be living in fear that they or their loved ones will be deported this holiday season. We need to bring people out of the shadows, reinstate and expand DACA and provide a pathway to citizenship. It is not enough to say we will rejoin the Paris Agreement. We need to build a mass movement of people to stand up to the fossil fuel industry and pass a Green New Deal. That is what this campaign is about. Thank you to the hundreds of thousands of postal workers who are working so hard this holiday season\u2014and every day throughout the year.\n\nTogether we are going to strengthen the Postal Service and protect it from privatization. We stand with Natalia Miranda and those in Iowa who have faced this disturbing violence. Hate crimes are increasing across the country. It's our job to stand with our Black and Latino family. We'll fight all forms of hatred and those who wish to spread it.\nhttps://t.co/SclvJ4PXsS If your kids are hurting, my kids are hurting. If you can't afford to see a doctor, that affects me as well. We must remember we are all connected and fight for a nation and a government that is based on human solidarity. I believe that every person in America deserves to live in dignity and security. That is why we must guarantee health care, decent housing, a living wage and a good education to all our people. As the new year approaches, let us commit to fighting for a government and an economy that works for the overwhelming majority of the people. That is how we will make food security a human right in America. https://t.co/2WWC5mGcXu RT @youngthegiant: thanks to @SenSanders and @AOC for hosting an amazing event just up the street from us this past weekend !!! hope Venice\u2026 RT @jesseyjoy: Thank you @berniesanders and @AOC for welcoming us and for inviting us to play for such an amazing crowd!!! https://t.co/oGm\u2026 In the richest country on Earth, getting sick should not mean you must declare bankruptcy or drown in debt for decades.

Walmart's CEO made 1,076 times their median employee last year.\n\nThe Walton family makes $25,000 a minute.\n\nDon't tell me that they can't afford to pay a living wage.\n\nThey choose not to out of greed.\n\nAnd together, that's the kind of greed we're going to end. Access to the internet is a necessity in today's economy, and it should be available for all. It must be treated as the new electricity. The federal government electrified America as part of the New Deal.\n\nThe United States put people on the moon 50 years ago. \n\nWe can sure as hell transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to 100% renewables today and create millions of jobs in the process. The War on Drugs has been a disaster. We need to legalize marijuana nationwide, invest in the communities that have been destroyed by its criminalization, and expunge past marijuana-related convictions. Insulin costs $6 per vial to make. Diabetics need it to survive.\n\nPharma companies in the U.S. sell it for over $300.\n\nOur health care system today is not about keeping people alive.\n\nIt is about making huge profits.\n\nMedicare for All is about changing that gross injustice.
