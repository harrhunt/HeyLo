When I left the studio and played it in my car I felt like it was my favorite song I\u2019ve made #1YeafOfCAMILA https://t.co/B1H1ZARyIV I wrote she loves control first as a title. for the first time in my life felt in control of my time, my life, and I think that all came from having control of my work honestly- we wrote the chorus to just guitar and then Skrillex came in and turned it around #1YeafOfCAMILA https://t.co/x3ZKR3FMvW Hmmmmm #1YearOfCamila - ask me some questions about each song and I\u2019ll spill some tea \u2615\ufe0f https://t.co/YDflw0AV4z I remember this day like it was yesterday \ud83d\ude2d https://t.co/QNyxS6LKSX I love you guys, love scrolling through your tweets seeing all your favorite songs from the album #1YearOfCamila https://t.co/yli0g1N5IS Happy anniversary, fam.
