We love your book in this house :) https://t.co/s8DzuGlzeM @CarmenCrincoli I could cry @robtswthrayguns I just realized I did IVF and it might just be John\u2019s sperm and somehow someway, a john egg living the dream https://t.co/h5tNhW4DRL @lea_smurf Useless is a worse word than \u201cless than\u201d @AirspaceIowa yes there are...so many scenarios @Yassir_Lester change your name and it takes it away!! @wyntermitchell IN A HEARTBEAT. someone can take it for their SoundCloud I want 500 followers again. I should sell this account and donate it to charity, is that legal Yeah agree! But I do see the hurt in causing even one person out there pain or making them feel less than just over a stupid tweet that I didn\u2019t need to repost either way! https://t.co/jYpVGMmeG0 You\u2019re right! I toss it in after or skip baking altogether because I ruin everything in the category https://t.co/IQ689ye4ia @_isabellew97 I didn\u2019t say they were here. Jesus. Well fuck me, I always think people are better than they are. That is my go to but it\u2019s been wrong so many times you\u2019d think id learn by now https://t.co/66mOOmUlHd I think since I am constantly in trouble here I look a lot at people\u2019s intentions of their tweets and I don\u2019t think that was her personal intention and it absolutely should never take off in that way so it\u2019s prob better to just not say (talking to myself here) https://t.co/zod7N6Gw5A @SPeitsch @DohaMadani But u went to the store for the juice. But I guess it lasts a few lemons. Not in my house though I use a tonnnn I guess @NymLovesCats @DohaMadani She didn\u2019t write it to attack the disabled. Intentions mean a lot. It believe it was just a cheeky tweet about ingredients people often use thinking they\u2019re the same (I get the comments all the time on the site!) @EricaJoy @DohaMadani Oh I use like....6 a day but Im gonna write that off to work. And like 35 cloves of garlic @madeusrestless Yes but cooking is about learning too! And it\u2019s fine to learn that your meal can taste better if you want it to. If you\u2019re just in a rush and don\u2019t care, that\u2019s fine too! Just too strong and not good for your blood I dunno I\u2019m not a doc but it\u2019s def too strong! https://t.co/9oPPAgnDm4 I would never tweet anything I do if I meant it completely literally. I feel like it was a semi serious thing said seriously gone wrong! @DohaMadani I don\u2019t get it. Slam some on the counter with a knife or cut a lemon and squeeze it with your hands. it\u2019s like two seconds lol @DanielleAlberti how? because of the wording? just don\u2019t take it so personally I guess. it\u2019s more \u201cmaking the wrong decisions\u201d but that isn\u2019t as funny to say. @kittynouveau don\u2019t use the it\u2019s cheaper excuse because it isn\u2019t! It\u2019s actually more. Except maybe the parm. Good parm is a lot. But you don\u2019t need the best parm! And I also still think this jar o parm tastes good, it\u2019s just not parm. Everything else can die! wait but I agree lol *ducks* https://t.co/HQKk1O0MvW All of this, and I\u2019ll never get over being in trump\u2019s ass after the wife comments.

Normalize a LOT of things in life! Me wanting to eat stove top in the bathtub or wear barefoot dreams underwear. But I\u2019m just talking about formula, that\u2019s all. @RachelVHer My brain and body went to the depths of hell. It had been so long without pain I forgot what it felt like. I learned feelings of relief have to happen often enough to give you hope it can happen again. When it doesn\u2019t, you wanna give up. But don\u2019t ok. \u2665\ufe0f @Txgeekgirl42 @KarizmaK I don\u2019t wanna try and one up each other anymore. and tbh it\u2019s all hard and I dunno, we just need to bond in the fact we have newborns at the time and how insane that is. not fight each other over feeding techniques. @RachelVHer Girl, I HEAR YOU, you have no idea how much I felt that. but if you can make it, and you CAN I promise I promise I PROMISE, you will find joy and relief again. I promise you, ok. Please trust me. @Txgeekgirl42 @KarizmaK the comparison you guys are doing is kinda unreal to me but I\u2019m gonna say, again, that you can say normalize formula feeding without making it about normalizing breastfeeding. . https://t.co/UPy8hctm68 @KarizmaK One, it\u2019s not a fight over who has it worse but formula-using moms like me who had postpartum literally wanted to die because of the guilt I had of not being a fit mother who could feed my baby from my body like I was supposed to, paired with crippling depression. But \u201cstares\u201d @Basti My mom thinks you\u2019re a robot too! I wanna break it and see what\u2019s inside so bad AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH https://t.co/f1aXqIrPZO @SneKhumaloSA lol shit ohhhhhhh trust me, I know ! https://t.co/EiqUD3mVwY @PosadistM @jrhennessy Perfect @lexlanham @TaylorLorenz !! @jaydahardy206 @fahrmaiden @PadmaLakshmi @AlisonLeiby lol @jrhennessy I keep saying it really truly love it here so much @mattryanx Who amongst us hasn\u2019t made the life altering decision of going private to take a moment, forever lol god dammit I\u2019ll always love them @TaylorLorenz HIRE BETTER DUDES AHHHHHHHHH @jaydahardy206 @fahrmaiden @PadmaLakshmi @AlisonLeiby ok be mad about it, that\u2019s a u thing @fahrmaiden @PadmaLakshmi @AlisonLeiby As in that is what they\u2019re saying when she made an innocent tweet about getting an extra item. Sorry if it didn\u2019t translate well without quotes @PadmaLakshmi @AlisonLeiby like...u impulsively picked chocolate and then prob more chocolate but fuck YOU! @PadmaLakshmi @AlisonLeiby Came here to defend this moronic insanity. guess it could have been read as \u201cwell, a grocery store\u201d or more RANdom shit included like a broken off white not-for-individual sale bath bomb from \u201881 but wouldn\u2019t take it CLOSE to the depths of think piecing or g e t t I n g m a d @TheEllenShow \u2665\ufe0f accepted and saved and hopeful. love to you, P, and...honestly not sure what or how many animals you have, but them too!

Sounded like The Weeknd but cannot finddddddddd on iTunes. GOING CRAZY, it was on Sirius 47 the heat @MissKlept GIVE BOOB A TRY, SURE, AND GETTTTTT THE FORMULA. WE ARE ALL DOING THE BEST WE CAN WITH WHAT WE HAVE. @MollyRoseTarpey truly, IN EVERY ASPECT. \"normalize minding your fucking business as long as it is not hurting anyone else\" needs to be a t-shirt lol the stress of it, combined with the guilt that you cannot do nature's most natural thing for your own baby is too much. I dunno why this is my crusade now. I just remember the sadness I felt and want you to know you are doing it right if your baby is fed, mama. I remember pumping my ASS OFF,  highest mode, so often, because I didn't trust milk was going into their mouthes if I breastfed. it drove me mad to the point I could only get an ounce. an ounce! @clasavie ! \"normalize breastfeeding\" is great. \"normalize formula\" is great, too! so yeah. that's all! normalize formula! your baby is gonna be BEAUTIFUL, PERFECT, AND OKAY. people have surrogates, people have trouble breastfeeding and all you hear as a new, anxious mom is how breast is best. normalize breastfeeding is such a huge, wonderful thing. but I absolutely felt way more shame having to use formula because of lack of milk from depression and whatnot. ok I'm gonna say something and you all are definitely gonna make it a thing but here goes: normalize formula. @raesanni Can we lower that please god, for me Arrivederci , bucatini al pesto! https://t.co/8uwyAA59B9 I\u2019m not kidding.

I don\u2019t. @lildickynixon @thousandpushups @JordanUhl Trust me. Biden adopting many bernie policies would be my personal now-heaven. But I want people to vote. Talking down on Biden with no message of voting at this point is entirely too risky when we have what is happening. @thousandpushups @JordanUhl We cannot stop stressing the importance of voting because people are not showing up. There is NO step two without step 1. John has been talking about healthcare for years now. So many people have. Way before Trump. @thousandpushups @JordanUhl I\u2019d much prefer we had him as a nominee than people you don\u2019t believe in. I\u2019d absolutely way rather that, especially over not voting at all (some) @thousandpushups @JordanUhl (Not saying you believe in trump) @thousandpushups @JordanUhl I don\u2019t know how to get bernie back for you though, I really don\u2019t.  I want you to have someone to believe in, at least more than you believe in trump. Been in bed for all but 5 mins of the last 24 hours. Here til next Tuesday.

I cannot find! I bought this thing but I need a welder or something to make it so it\u2019s split into two rolls/two rolls.

I\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s a tv show with a ridiculous premise. I\u2019m sorry if it triggered something. @SaraBeverley And I absolutely believe Epstein was sick and a lot of politicians are sick. And I get to be lumped in with it because I\u2019m the only one that addresses it and attacks them back. They can ALL rot. @dawud_ansari @robtswthrayguns I\u2019m so consistently hurt on here I thought you were talking about me and had a reply all lined up @SaraBeverley This isn\u2019t about saving the children. It\u2019s about attacking outspoken political opponents. Everyone on that list has spoken up against Trump. That is no coincidence. @SaraBeverley I did for three years, since I\u2019m from a large hub of sex trafficking, Southeast Asia. I can\u2019t even say it because they\u2019ll just say I did it as a coverup. There is no stopping it, no explaining to each person the logs are fake. It\u2019s pointless and exhausting. And you\u2019re still doing it. Even though it\u2019s so annoying you cannot help yourselves. Someone do a case study on people of the internet my god Do. Not. Tell. Me. To. Go. To. Bed. You\u2019re. Up. Too. Incredible pet peeve @SaraBeverley It is an incredible waste of time to focus on the wrong people. Their energy could be channeled elsewhere but this is easy, and they can be anonymous and FEEL helpful and a part of something. @SaraBeverley The truth is it\u2019s all over. It\u2019s not stuck in Hollywood. It\u2019s uncles and neighbors and all types right around everyone. But it\u2019s easy for the problem to be \u201csomewhere else\u201d - then they aren\u2019t at fault for being blindfolded when it\u2019s so close to home. @MarwaBalkar people actually pretending nothing is on fire. Can\u2019t stand it anymore. Feckless. @SaraBeverley Nothing works. You have no idea who we are dealing with here. Trust me. @TravelLeisure We...we can\u2019t go anywhere @Bill_TPA fufk me dadddddy @Turtleexo really upsetting cyber sexxing here Honestly these used to bother me but they\u2019re quite welcome in comparison https://t.co/mIm7WGWDa8 @Caliguy45 It\u2019s big but not enough room for baby.

Replies. @SaraBeverley Because it\u2019s literally the worst word ever to be associated with. And half the people on the list have never even heard of qanon. They live glorious lives off the internet. I know some of them! How wonderful to have no idea. The last episode aired in 2013. You cannot claim spoiler here. This is like, my 44th viewing of this. @TheTylerDiaz2 @Kalli329 @TheNotoriousLEX You got twenty replies. Man the fuck up. my medication could have never prepared me for this shit. But here they are living life! Yes absolutely jealous!! I\u2019m honestly kind of over following people on Instagram who never speak up for anything. I get it, it\u2019s WAY less stressful, but I\u2019m exhausted taking the heat. Notice anyone who has ever spoken up is brutally verbally attacked/put on fake flight logs.
