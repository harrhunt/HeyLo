Like meatloaf, spaghetti and meatballs, roasted chicken are the obvious ones but what about not so obvious, like chicken paillard or chicken piccata, masala, etc... my books always reflect the time they are made in, so the first book had no dessert (too scared), second had a liiiiiittle (didn't have a passion for more than a handful of sweets) and now, oh there is dessert alright. officially started the cookbook! first step, a google doc between @AdeenaSussman and I where at every hour of the day and night (she is in Tel Aviv!), ideas are popped into organized chaos. currently discussing the beauty that was the mrs field's white choc macadamia nut cookie! @Nilanthi_15 @yashar thank you ma'am @SilvermanESPN @iammakeupjunkie @vinn_ayy I thrive in any america. which is why I want others to be able to. if I weren't empathetic to it, I wouldn't care. you're mad someone cares about you and not just themselves? @Nilanthi_15 @yashar thank u sir I will def go ride my horsies @SilvermanESPN @iammakeupjunkie @vinn_ayy so you admit to punishing us (and yourself) - incredible train of thought. @natalaame if anything, pregnant people hate hearing \"oh you're so small!\" because it kind of implies our baby isn't growing. I def hate that more than \"wow you popped!\" @natalaame same!! but everyone thinks we actually are dumb enough to believe this makes us smaller. we know it doesn't and no one is telling us that! like give us all some credit, I feel ZERO pressure to be a small pregnant person. on the controversy that is pregnancy shapewear: it\u2019s not to be smaller. these brands aren\u2019t pressuring us to be smaller. thanks for looking out for us everyone but we\u2019re good! https://t.co/8arPjfDiUl @yashar I want to go ride my horsies lollll I love him so much.

Been two days @ikea16 Swear to god I think I\u2019m just living out my own dreams as a child. We don\u2019t need it like at all @MorganMezzmer i never sleep pregnant @SpiralDee Thank you! Bit of a bummer as our house is for sale and I don\u2019t think anyone else is looking for a room like this lol https://t.co/9lyx0fsmSV Oh and this god forsaken thing I thought was smaller https://t.co/tvGZtR7Xyi We are absolutely bringing in a professional but I\u2019ve got cooking, john\u2019s got music, grandma has...day drinking. It will be a great school year Everyone get ready for .... miss chrissy. pregnant and here for it (I really have always wanted to be a teacher!) https://t.co/NIaMsh3cCH @lololin86 @CaliHasSpoken I have a preschool pod at my house all year ahhhhhh miss Chrissy @yashar Why! I need a welder! @ThatJBrown https://t.co/kkze5ixqeM @ThatJBrown Oh I went off. Standby for video @CaliHasSpoken I would buy two! @Candaceundone I think I\u2019d be a lot quirkier. Like a nyc artist lady with mismatched skirts and boots @Turtleexo Oh my gosh you very much could I promise In an unprecedented Twitter move, I have received ACTUAL usable help!!!! https://t.co/v5fKS1yBQP @ThatJBrown A preschool at home \ud83d\ude02 @andrewag428 OMGAH YES!!! @LucasLilieholm I don\u2019t need more paper. I just need two rolls next to two rolls to fit underneath a countertop! @MollyJongFast OH MY GOD HE WILL HAVE AN OFFICIAL LIST HANDED TO HIM LIKE MY NAME IN HIS HAND HOOOOOL BOY HOW EXCITING god he thinks NOTHING of his supporters Alternatively, if someone can link me to an already existing 2-roll (the paper is 36 inches wide!) that I am buy two of, that would be preferred. I cannot find! I bought this thing but I need a welder or something to make it so it\u2019s split into two rolls/two rolls. Cut in half with a bottom put on the top half so it ends up being 2 rolls next to 2 rolls. Is there someone in LA who can do this who is currently up lol (its huge) https://t.co/OArOSJlqhP This makes me think about what I would wear if I didn\u2019t impose rules on myself. It would be NOTHING like what I normally wear. I wish I had the balls to wear what I want. I love people who embrace their brains. https://t.co/rSLSpbGhvZ I\u2019ve tried using elephant garlic before and it would be GENIUS but it holds like, a quarter of the flavor of one clove! https://t.co/YSTUlu8O4f @thedovecoteorg ?? I\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s a tv show with a ridiculous premise. I\u2019m sorry if it triggered something. @SaraBeverley And I absolutely believe Epstein was sick and a lot of politicians are sick. And I get to be lumped in with it because I\u2019m the only one that addresses it and attacks them back. They can ALL rot. @dawud_ansari @robtswthrayguns I\u2019m so consistently hurt on here I thought you were talking about me and had a reply all lined up @SaraBeverley This isn\u2019t about saving the children. It\u2019s about attacking outspoken political opponents. Everyone on that list has spoken up against Trump. That is no coincidence. @SaraBeverley I did for three years, since I\u2019m from a large hub of sex trafficking, Southeast Asia. I can\u2019t even say it because they\u2019ll just say I did it as a coverup. There is no stopping it, no explaining to each person the logs are fake. It\u2019s pointless and exhausting. And you\u2019re still doing it. Even though it\u2019s so annoying you cannot help yourselves. Someone do a case study on people of the internet my god Do. Not. Tell. Me. To. Go. To. Bed. You\u2019re. Up. Too. Incredible pet peeve @SaraBeverley It is an incredible waste of time to focus on the wrong people. Their energy could be channeled elsewhere but this is easy, and they can be anonymous and FEEL helpful and a part of something. @SaraBeverley The truth is it\u2019s all over. It\u2019s not stuck in Hollywood. It\u2019s uncles and neighbors and all types right around everyone. But it\u2019s easy for the problem to be \u201csomewhere else\u201d - then they aren\u2019t at fault for being blindfolded when it\u2019s so close to home. @MarwaBalkar people actually pretending nothing is on fire. Can\u2019t stand it anymore. Feckless. @SaraBeverley Nothing works. You have no idea who we are dealing with here. Trust me. @TravelLeisure We...we can\u2019t go anywhere @Bill_TPA fufk me dadddddy @Turtleexo really upsetting cyber sexxing here Honestly these used to bother me but they\u2019re quite welcome in comparison https://t.co/mIm7WGWDa8 @Caliguy45 It\u2019s big but not enough room for baby. My mom lives with us as well and need space for our dear nephews and nieces! @TheNotoriousLEX @TheTylerDiaz2 @Kalli329 They\u2019re suuuuuch bitches. 20. Replies. @SaraBeverley Because it\u2019s literally the worst word ever to be associated with. And half the people on the list have never even heard of qanon. They live glorious lives off the internet. I know some of them! How wonderful to have no idea. The last episode aired in 2013. You cannot claim spoiler here. This is like, my 44th viewing of this. @TheTylerDiaz2 @Kalli329 @TheNotoriousLEX You got twenty replies. Man the fuck up. my medication could have never prepared me for this shit. But here they are living life! Yes absolutely jealous!! I\u2019m honestly kind of over following people on Instagram who never speak up for anything. I get it, it\u2019s WAY less stressful, but I\u2019m exhausted taking the heat. Notice anyone who has ever spoken up is brutally verbally attacked/put on fake flight logs. It\u2019s really just old. @TheTylerDiaz2 @Kalli329 @TheNotoriousLEX It doesn\u2019t matter - she is right. I speak up because it is the right thing to do. Plenty of people don\u2019t and don\u2019t get put on phony flight logs with coordinated attacks. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s less stressful. Go follow them. It\u2019s weird that they just passed a baby around and gave it away to nelly on the last episode of the office lol FUCK ME UPPPPP, THOMAS https://t.co/cwtTBLmi86 Jeanine I\u2019ll send you your very own special sexy pics of me if u stop this https://t.co/obUCMOZP5N I would quite literally pay to stay here https://t.co/ULwrGTE6ro Googling millstone for when the time comes @asooma Absolutely You really should have to use your real name and address to verify for this app. https://t.co/yWQWTrcUWi @CruzanChoklate me when john wears a white shirt and black suit @KaralynWest @stuholden Lol!

IVF was an amazing choice for us to be able to make. So hard, but we got two beautiful monsters out of it. I promise you, I never ever ever ever ever thought I could.

Anyone who knows me knows I have taken a pregnancy test nearly every month since I was 21. I know it's weird. I just always, always wanted to see a positive. This was the time! https://t.co/igAW18q26f Didn't know how I'd ever bring it up but I knew I couldn't not tell you guys. https://t.co/mvrOrfcUyB @m_overcash @maryobarton @nugglebubble @grubreport there is a cusp, a window. we were in the window. no need to place blame. I *lived* this. @m_overcash @maryobarton @nugglebubble @grubreport it is in no way malpractice. it was a false negative. Also, you guys have seen how rough these past few months were for me here. So now you know why I just extra appreciated all the love and support through it all, especially since you didn't even know. You just thought I was in stressful internet hell. But what they say so often can be true. When you give up on trying, life has a way of surprising you. In summary, my boobs hurt. So we prayed to the boob surgery gods that everything would be okay. Went to every appointment terrified. Even without the surgery, I didn't think I could get pregnant naturally anyway. So the odds just felt...bad. ...I was not disappointed. But I was scared shitless. Was pretty positive you shouldn't get your boobs out while pregnant? Pretty sure. so the morning of John's album release, he wakes up at 3am to do good morning america. I woke up with him and was like man, should take my monthly test to be disappointed.... a few weeks after surgery, I took a test. And for many years now, I've taken pregnancy tests almost every month, praying to see a positive one day. Just wishful thinking. I never had a positive before. I did the routine pregnancy test you do before surgery. It said negative. It was not negative. Oh, it's quite a story. lol https://t.co/NIxwcQrcI2 please share your favorite stone fruit recipes here!

I said the same thing again. you are such a fucking liar, shocking. @trade_set @TomCottonAR The point is not that the founding fathers thought that, it\u2019s that he agrees. It\u2019s very simple if you aren\u2019t doing mental gymnastics to lie about it. @trade_set @TomCottonAR Did Tom lie about his exact quote and call it fake news? That is what we are talking about but since you\u2019re giving up on that because you\u2019re wrong, you\u2019ve moved on. @trade_set @TomCottonAR Oops accidentally deleted. The word \u201cviewed\u201d was not in there.

Literally we have the quote. You are lying. worst part about 90 days to me is hearing people crap on the country\u2019s foods, spitting it out, suggesting it\u2019s dirty.

You seem to be more into it than anyone. @Jalen_Warfield @MorolongZA @Nki19 I love Cape Town but I did get extremely effed up at the Durban July and had an incredible time. I really love the entire country, I can\u2019t pick an area. It is incredibly special. @Fireyfields @sonnif68 @Hi_ImBunz Some stands would have whipped butter to spread before dipping. A thick slab of butter on bread, dipped in curry. Oh my goddddd I miss it. @Hi_ImBunz If I could find an unsliced loaf of white ass wonder bread I def would. It\u2019s not the same with sliced bread! It needs to fill a loaf! @Fireyfields @sonnif68 @Hi_ImBunz I used to get it filled with lamb and hot sauce on the side of the road, usually by gas stations. No utensils, just ripping bread and dipping, ripping bread and dipping. Loved the cheap white wonder bread!! So soft and soaked it all up @Kiarl1 Kiarl no one does that buddy, we\u2019re idiots @BaiSaengkeo @cravings I appreciate it so much! Let me know if I can help with anything. @cullison_eric Biltong is! A few great butchers in LA. I like it thick cut white white fat. I dip it in my mom\u2019s hot sauce - two muddled cherry tomatoes, roasted red chili flakes, fish sauce and a little hot water. @MorolongZA @Nki19 My ex was South African, from Durban. He cooked. Lol @TheBellaMaake @Josephine_KK If people forget the controversy, they forget *her*. Attention is a hell of a drug! @DuboisTamara Two years ago!!? Thank u for letting me know. I just thought the more obvious insult was too mean. you guess! there\u2019s a bunch @stephaniebell65 @40EA Well that is adorable. @Josephine_KK @TheBellaMaake Also it was a very malicious thing! Not just a joke that went wrong or a mistake. Remember Justine? I stillllll remember that and that wasn\u2019t even meant to be evil. Just terrible humor. @sonnif68 @johnstaz88 @patriciamkwan @veganhippiesol @ImpossibleFoods @BeyondMeat Never tried it but sounds good! I\u2019ve never had veggie grill because I heard it\u2019s low key not great for you (meanwhile I eat terribly anyway?) and yeah, I get terrible headaches only steak can cure (really!) (hate iron pills) @Nki19 One of my favorite places on earth. Wish I could remember but been all over!!! @40EA A cheeky nandos? Lol @jadaagraves We do two until I get insanely hot or sick of the dick in my back @johnstaz88 @patriciamkwan @veganhippiesol Honestly I believe I will try it one day! Def wanna try it for at least a month. But with @ImpossibleFoods and @BeyondMeat I really think I could. I actually prefer it over burger meat. BUT I need my ribeye \ud83d\ude29 anything else can go @heasgarnich Thank u for the warning I hope she doesn\u2019t stop me from eating even though it\u2019s not bothering her @TheBellaMaake @Josephine_KK I find they are initially apologetic then gain more and more anger as time goes by. Then they find their victim niche and become fox taking heads. @DuboisTamara can I send u my eyebrow girl? she is a magician and will honestly make them normal again I loved nandos when I had only had it in South Africa.

There are always gonna be racist people to buy the beans. They aren\u2019t going under. Support the workers by empowering them to be stronger than this absolute bastard. I will personally do what I can to financially ensure these farms can carry on without them. The next step republicans will do (mark my words, they did this with my equinox tweets as well) is say you aren\u2019t supporting the workers if you boycott. You ARE. They should never feel they have to work for someone who agrees Mexicans are \u201cvile\u201d \u201crapists\u201d - FUCK this guy @stevenbward @TaylorLorenz U are absolutely making up terms.

And honestly, for the past few days, every time I saw a shallot I wanted to cry, but I do appreciate this and hopefully we can all be better and learn from the dumb shit we have all said and done. I still think you are incredibly talented. And in an industry that doesn\u2019t really lend itself to supporting more than a handful of people at a time, I feel like all we have are each other! I often comment about how I wish I could get away with what I used to, now, but the truth is, I don\u2019t. I\u2019ve learned a fuckton from my years being watched (&amp; read) and I can really say it makes you a better person!  It makes u think about the impact of what u say/who it might hurt Oh! but how I still think some of those things. I just maybe don\u2019t unleash on my peers on super public platforms lol. Eventually, I realized that once the relatable \u201csnarky girl who didn\u2019t care\u201d became a pretty successful cookbook author and had more power in the industry, I couldn\u2019t just say whatever the fuck I wanted.  The more we grow, the more we get those wakeup calls. I think we are alike in so many ways. I remember the exact time I realized I wasn\u2019t allowed to say whatever popped in my head-that I couldn\u2019t just say things in the way that so many of my friends were saying. Before, I never really knew where I stood in the industry, in the world I don\u2019t agree with the pile-on, ppl waiting with bated breath for apologies, deciding if that apology is good, the ppl who say u were right &amp; never needed to in the first place - there are so many different types in this kind of situation &amp; tbh, I just want it to be over thank u for this, @alisoneroman. To be clear, it never once crossed my mind for u to apologize for what you genuinely thought! The comments stung, but they moreso stung because they came from u! It wasn\u2019t my usual news break of some random person hating everything about me! I have too much to say and no room let's try again whoops haven't tweeted for so long This is what always happens. The first day, a ton of support, then the next, 1 million reasons as to why you deserved this. It never fails. I really hate what this drama has caused this week. Calling my kids Petri dish babies or making up flight manifests with my name on them to \u201cEpstein island\u201d, to justify someone else\u2019s disdain with me seems gross to me so I\u2019m gonna take a little break. well done on both the bread and the butter! https://t.co/8mIQdkoAu0 me, John and luna will be on the @baby2baby instagram account icing cookies in a bit to talk to @nicolerichie and hopefully raise a little bit of money for their incredible organization! she is getting pretty good with hair! Wants to own a salon. Nails and hair twisting only. No cuts or color! https://t.co/d5uLbi8x3L Well it happened again.

Thank you!! @amandafreitag \ud83d\ude2d @AdamRichman real tears! @STFUParents Obsessed with her still and was obsessed with your site still!! Would give anything for it to come back!! @eunowhat I\u2019m gonna cry (really) @STFUParents \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude2d thank you I really appreciate that and you remembering that! @I_archer It helped me through mine as well! That\u2019s why all of this started. And prob why it hurts so much. I do this because it makes you annnnd me happy. @andyroddick I tried to read this to john and had to stop to cry one sentence in anyhow. now that that's out there, I guess we should probably unfollow each other @alisoneroman there are many days I cry very hard because cravings, the site, is our baby we love to pump content onto. we do this work ourselves, and there is NO monetary gain yet. it is just work work work and the reward is you liking it. so to be called a sellout....hooooo it hurts It has been crappy to deal with this all day but I couldn't not say something. I know the actual tears I put into the work I do and it's really hard to see someone try to completely invalidate it. Someone I really liked. I don't think I've ever been so bummed out by the words of a fellow food-lover. I just had no idea I was perceived that way, by her especially. And Marie, too. Marie is awesome. I genuinely loved everything about Alison. Was jealous she got to have a book with food on the cover instead of a face!! I've made countless NYT recipes she's created, posting along the way. to see that thing in my hand being used by people around the world makes me so happy. Watching a company grow makes me happy. I get joy from it and lots of people do. I didn't \"sell out\" by making my dreams come true. To have a cookware line, to get to be a part of that process start to finish, to see something go from sketch to in my hands, I love that. I started cravings because I wanted something for myself. I wanted something John didn't buy, I wanted something to do that calmed me, made me happy and made others happy, too. Cravings isn't a \"machine\" or \"farmed content\" - it's me and 2 other women. this is a huge bummer and hit me hard. I have made her recipes for years now, bought the cookbooks, supported her on social and praised her in interviews. I even signed on to executive produce the very show she talks about doing in this article. https://t.co/9xrvQBInAp I dunno who sent me this sourdough kit with sourdough starter already done but THANK U!

Guys. There are different ways to skin a cat (not cat) @NykyBailey @prosediva @jeditigger It\u2019s got nothing to do with the dumplings. It\u2019s a 3 hour recipe, the chicken is browned first. I could add heavy cream to make it lighter, but I don\u2019t want to as I just had pot pie. Why is your way the only way lol @NykyBailey @TheKalenAllen @johnlegend sigh. gumbo is a completely different recipe with. soup color is not the difference between gumbo and chicken n dumplings @runawaytonight @TheKalenAllen some have a cream base and some don\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t chicken and dumplings @huawkward that is such a weird gift I would die for @DonJuan_805 I know.

I don't do what everyone loves - creating mazes to trap village or thinking about city layout or island hopping etc. I purely just fish, hunt bugs, make and spend money and change my outfits. @Schtickzinger @gordonsjones1 @JordanUhl chad is too young.
