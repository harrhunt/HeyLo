And that\u2019s still the truth, no matter what some folks want you to believe. If you live in Georgia, make sure you vote for @ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff in tomorrow\u2019s U.S. Senate runoffs\u2014and make sure everybody you know does the same. If you\u2019ve already received a mail-in ballot, take it to a drop-box or vote in person at your polling place tomorrow. So if Georgians elect @ReverendWarnock and @Ossoff, we\u2019ll take another step toward cleaning up the mess of the past four years. And we\u2019ll send a message to any politician who puts themselves and their ambition above our system of self-government. These runoffs will decide whether President-Elect Biden has a Senate that will work with him rather than just obstruct him at every turn. Tomorrow\u2019s runoffs in Georgia will decide whether the U.S. Senate is run by those who\u2019ve shown their willingness to tear down our democracy\u2014or whether it\u2019ll be run by those who will actually get to work on the monumental challenges before us. This is why we can\u2019t just vote for President and think that our job is done. And this is just unconscionable at a time when a staggering number of Americans are dying every day from a virus that was downplayed for far too long. It\u2019s unconscionable to focus on overturning an election rather than helping struggling families or distributing a vaccine. Your vote is your voice. It\u2019s your power. And right now, from the President of the United States on down, we\u2019re seeing and hearing just how desperate some are to take that power away. They want us to believe that their pride is more important than our democracy.

We\u2019ve got to promise each other that our focus in this election won\u2019t be an anomaly, but the rule. That\u2019s how we can not only feel this way right now, but in the months and years ahead. It\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll build a nation worthy of our children. So it\u2019s up to us to stay engaged and informed, to keep speaking out and marching on. We\u2019ve got to vote in even greater numbers in the upcoming Senate runoffs in Georgia\u2014and every state and local election going forward. We see now the reality that we can\u2019t take even the tiniest part of our democracy for granted. Every single vote must count \u2014 and every single one of us must vote. And as a country, we should be making it easier, not harder to cast a ballot. But we\u2019ve also got to recognize that the path to progress will always be uphill. We\u2019ll always have to scrape and crawl up toward that mountaintop. And two years from now, four years from now, there will once again be no margin for error. Let\u2019s remember that tens of millions of people voted for the status quo, even when it meant supporting lies, hate, chaos, and division. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do to reach out to these folks in the years ahead and connect with them on what unites us. And after we celebrate \u2014 and we should all take a moment to exhale after everything we\u2019ve been through \u2014 let\u2019s remember that this is just a beginning. It\u2019s a first step. Voting in one election isn\u2019t a magic wand, and neither is winning one. Thank you to all of you who poured every ounce of your hope and determination into this democracy over these past four years, registering voters, getting them to the polls, keeping folks informed. More votes were cast in this election than ever before. It\u2019s because of you. I\u2019m beyond thrilled that my friend @JoeBiden and our first Black and Indian-American woman Vice President, @KamalaHarris, are headed to restore some dignity, competence, and heart at the White House.

So I hope you\u2019ll watch, and I hope you\u2019ll share this with everyone you know who might still be deciding how or if they\u2019re going to vote. There\u2019s only one way we can pull ourselves out\u2014by voting for my friend @JoeBiden, who\u2019s got the heart, the experience, and the character to lead us to better days. Because the drama of the past few days has only emphasized what\u2019s at stake in this election, from the coronavirus to a constant drumbeat of fear, division, and chaos that\u2019s threatening to spiral out of control. And I\u2019ll be very honest: This is a message I\u2019d planned to release earlier, and after everything that\u2019s happened, I weighed whether or not to go public at all. But I wanted you all to hear what\u2019s been on my mind. The truth is, the events of the past few days are a bracing reminder of the tragedy that has been this administration\u2019s response to this crisis. My heart goes out to everyone touched by this virus, from those at the White House, especially the Secret Service and residence staff whose service ought never be taken for granted, to all those names and stories most of us will unfortunately never know. https://t.co/dtEUrcjPAy RT @Malala: \u201cI learned a lot at school\u2014how to do my multiplication tables and write an essay... but also how to push myself, dust myself of\u2026 There are remarkable organizations all over the world working to ensure girls keep learning safely during the pandemic.

The choice couldn\u2019t be clearer\u2013\u2013we've got to vote for @JoeBiden like our lives depend on it. https://t.co/y0qYHE0iAV Look, I understand why people are cynical right now. I talked with Conan about what it feels like to be a mother and a person of color in this moment\u2014and how if we want to hope for some change on any of the issues we care about, then we've got to vote for @JoeBiden. https://t.co/A6WTNqH038 Make sure they know how and when they\u2019re going to vote. And then follow up with them, every day, to make sure they cast their ballot. Because in this election, we\u2019ve got to vote for Joe in numbers that cannot be denied. https://t.co/vS12U5kabm It\u2019s the only way we can get out of this chaos and restore some stability to this country. You can start by reaching out to everyone you know. Make sure they\u2019re registered. If you were turned off by the President\u2019s behavior last night, I feel you. Believe me, I do. But we can\u2019t let him win by tuning out altogether. That\u2019s what he wants. So turn those feelings into action\u2014turn them into votes for my friend, @JoeBiden. https://t.co/cMKoxiNWVZ I\u2019m feeling so grateful for each of the conversations I had on the first season of the #MichelleObamaPodcast.

Go further. And if you hold strong with the same faith that carried all those giants before you toward real, measurable progress\u2014you will change the course of history. Dr. King was angry. Sojourner Truth was angry. Lucretia Mott, Cesar Chavez, the folks at Stonewall\u2014they were all angry.\n\nBut they were also driven by compassion, by principle\u2014by hope. To anyone who\u2019s feeling invisible: Know that your story matters. Your ideas, your experiences, your vision for our world all matter.\n\nYour anger\u2014that matters too. But left on its own, it will only corrode, destroy, and sow chaos\u2014on the inside and out. So much has changed so quickly. And if any of you are confused or scared or angry\u2014or just plain overwhelmed\u2014I just want you to know that you aren\u2019t alone. I am feeling all that, too.

I tried to put words to what I\u2019m feeling about this moment, how we got here, and where we\u2019re headed. I hope you\u2019ll join us: https://t.co/k9OQq2Gfiz https://t.co/lByCWNgWDW RT @BarackObama: I wrote out some thoughts on how to make this moment a real turning point to bring about real change\u2013\u2013and pulled together\u2026 It ends with justice, compassion, and empathy that manifests in our lives and on our streets. I pray we all have the strength for that journey, just as I pray for the souls and the families of those who were taken from us. It\u2019s up to all of us\u2014Black, white, everyone\u2014no matter how well-meaning we think we might be, to do the honest, uncomfortable work of rooting it out. It starts with self-examination and listening to those whose lives are different from our own. Race and racism is a reality that so many of us grow up learning to just deal with. But if we ever hope to move past it, it can\u2019t just be on people of color to deal with it. Like so many of you, I\u2019m pained by these recent tragedies. And I\u2019m exhausted by a heartbreak that never seems to stop. Right now it\u2019s George, Breonna, and Ahmaud. Before that it was Eric, Sandra, and Michael. It just goes on, and on, and on. https://t.co/lFWEtTzVT8 Last year, I celebrated 50 years of Sesame Street with Big Bird, Grover, and the whole gang.
