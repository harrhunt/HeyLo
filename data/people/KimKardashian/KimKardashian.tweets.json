Me for @TeleFashion\u2026 I am so excited to announce our @SKIMS International retail debut with @Selfridges, launching in London, Birmingham, and Manchester and online at https://t.co/Uj03fhKQ5b on October 5. https://t.co/V2jb73FLwo \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/MBYHsHOZUI Based on the majority of positive feedback we have received so far from pregnant women around the world, I am incredibly proud to provide a solution that will provide comfort and support during the times that we all need it most, during pregnancy and after. We launched this category in response to the tens of thousands of pregnant women who wrote us requesting it and because it was something I personally needed when I was pregnant myself. and the compression on the leggings helps with pain relief caused by swelling. It is also worn after you have given birth and provides the comfort and support that most women need after delivery especially if you are recovering from a cesarean. The belly part doesn\u2019t slim your belly, it\u2019s actually sheer and a thinner layered material compared to the rest of the garment. It provides support to help with the uncomfortable weight being carried in your stomach which affects your lower back - To anyone who has an issue with maternity solutionwear, and if you haven\u2019t been pregnant before you may not know the struggle of what it\u2019s like carrying all of this weight the way I did along with millions of strong women, @skims maternity line is not to slim but to support.

I can only imagine how hard this is and my intention is never to open up this painful wound but to help find the truth behind this tragedy. Today I\u2019m teaming up with @MonicaDenise, @JessicaJackson and @EdyHaney to #FreeCoreyMiller True justice for the young man requires that the person who actually killed him be held responsible and that Corey Miller he returned home to his kids. Since his trial, witnesses have recanted, new evidence of his potential innocence has come to light, and there are claims of jurors being pressured into voting to convict. The jury convicted Corey 10-2 and he was sentenced him to life in prison. If his trial was today, the jury would have had to be unanimous for him to be convicted. #FreeCoreyMiller\n\nOn January 18, 2002 a tragedy occurred when a young man was killed. The next day Corey Miller was arrested for the murder. RT @KKWFRAGRANCE: LAST DAY to enter the @KylieJenner by KKW Fragrance giveaway!

I am exhausted by the heartbreak I feel seeing mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers and children suffering because their loved one was murdered or locked away unjustly for being black. But the privilege I am afforded by the color of my skin has often left me feeling like this is not a fight that I can truly take on as my own. Not today, not anymore. Like so many of you, I am angry. I am more than angry. I am infuriated and I am disgusted.

I know you are all dealing with more serious and important matters. Kanye has documented the making of all of his albums for his personal archive, however has never released any of it for public consumption &amp; the call between the two of them would have remained private or would have gone in the trash had she not lied &amp; forced me to defend him. To add, Kanye as an artist has every right to document his musical journey and process, just like she recently did through her documentary. I never edited the footage (another lie) - I only posted a few clips on Snapchat to make my point and the full video that recently leaked doesn\u2019t change the narrative. \u201cdeclined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message.\u201d\n\nThe lie was never about the word bitch, It was always whether there was a call or not and the tone of the conversation. At the time when they spoke the song had not been fully written yet, but as everyone can see in the video, she manipulated the truth of their actual conversation in her statement when her team said she To be clear, the only issue I ever had around the situation was that Taylor lied through her publicist who stated that \u201cKanye never called to ask for permission...\u201d They clearly spoke so I let you all see that. Nobody ever denied the word \u201cbitch\u201d was used without her permission. I didn\u2019t feel the need to comment a few days ago, and I\u2019m actually really embarrassed and mortified to be doing it right now, but because she continues to speak on it, I feel I\u2019m left without a choice but to respond because she is actually lying. .@taylorswift13 has chosen to reignite an old exchange - that at this point in time feels very self-serving given the suffering millions of real victims are facing right now.

Tynice rehabilitated herself and prepared for a future outside of prison by completing numerous classes and becoming certified in various trades.

A mother, she left behind two young sons. This was Judith\u2019s first ever offense. https://t.co/4dQHJikOjp Crystal case was highlighted in the First Step Act which banned the degrading and inhumane treatment of shackling female prisoners during childbirth.

We have heard people all around the globe speak up. And all because of a deep belief that every man or woman accused of a crime - especially one punishable by death - deserves the chance to have all available evidence considered. Words cannot describe the relief and hope that swept over the room in that moment. That hope had been building over the last few weeks around Rodney\u2019s case. We have seen Democrats and Republicans come together. We have seen grassroots activists and lawmakers link arms. Today, I had the honor of meeting #RodneyReed in person and the privilege of sitting with him when he got the news that the highest court in Texas had issued a stay of execution and remanded the case back to the trial court for further consideration. Be sure to join the waitlist at https://t.co/Qsy51S3rtD to be the first to shop when the collection drops!

After the name change, we wanted to make sure we didn\u2019t waste any of the original @skims product, so we tried and tested hundreds of different approaches to remove the old branding to ensure we saved it all.

But at the end I went into my old bathroom, closed the door &amp; cried so hard. https://t.co/0JLNtBItzR I even remade the exact license plates. (Yes my mom had a 2 DIE 4 license plate!) We drove to the home in these cars and relived our childhood! This was the best day ever. I am so proud I was able to keep such a meaningful surprise a secret from my mom and sisters for weeks! I had some waiting outside so we could drive them to the house and the rest were lined up in the driveway of the house exactly how my parents used to have them parked. We had lunch at the home as if it hadn\u2019t changed and we cried the entire time. When we walked out to get our cars to drive there, I had another surprise! I had rented every car my parents ever owned. All of our memories live here especially with our dad. It\u2019s where each Kardashian child was born &amp; made us who we are. Growing up, the home had the most ridiculous wallpaper &amp; kitchen set! I remade all of our table settings out of the same fabric &amp; print as the wallpaper. I then gave everyone the REAL invitation and once everyone saw the address for where we would be going tears filled the room. I rented our childhood home. https://t.co/RL6QTP5l8d For her birthday I planned a small lunch, with just her kids and her closest friends of 40 + years. I sent out invites with a location where we all met. When everyone arrived, I told them I had a surprise and this wasn\u2019t where we would be eating. Today we celebrate my mom.

Launching TOMORROW on Friday, 09\u2026 I am a strong believer that in order for change to happen, you must be willing to work with all people, even when you have differences in political opinions. @ANCA_DC I will be visiting Armenia in the next 2 weeks and hope to seek ways I can help increase trade and hopefully create jobs for Armenians which includes @skims production there in the future. @ANCA_DC As a brand, we believe in embracing all people and as an individual I have been working towards broader goals in hopes of bringing forward the recognition of the Armenian genocide which I remain very passionate about. @ANCA_DC We consulted with experts and searched globally for the best in class options, some which was found in Turkey. We believe strongly against discrimination of any kind; against anyone or any nation based on the past. @ANCA_DC Thank you @anca_dc for your concerns &amp; support. When I first began dreaming of owning my own shapewear company, I knew I wanted every piece to be made the best way possible; from the finest materials; starting from design stage through to creation, testing, innovation &amp; fit. https://t.co/Xzbzncnolh Listen to the @foodgod\u2019s podcast yet?!
