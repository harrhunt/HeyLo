I do know he left this earth feeling supported and loved and at peace. \ud83d\udd4a \nThis just has to change: our system is so fucked up We would talk about music a lot and how he\u2019s gotten into classical music lately to soothe his soul. He\u2019s a master at crochet amd would laugh that if someone just saw his cell they would think it was a grandmas cell. With the public support he felt the shame could go away and it validated him to his family that the world also knew he was better then his teenage self. The most important thing to him that he said was a gift to his mom, sister, daughters and family was the validation the public support gave to his family. His family knew him inside and knew he wasn\u2019t his mistake he made as a teenager but he was sad his family felt shame. His main message that he learned in his life was to not hang out with the wrong crowd. That was so important to him that he shared that with the youth. It got him caught up and he made poor choices. Brandon wanted me to tell every single person who worked on his behalf supporting him in any way a huge thank you. He was certain he was gonna have the chance to tell you all himself and write you all letters but he told me to tell you all how grateful he is for you! As he was in the chair his attorney called me and they just had their last call and said this...\nBrandon said he loves you and wants to say thank you again\nHe said he doesn\u2019t feel too claustrophobic in the chair. \ud83d\udc94 \ud83d\udd4a\ud83d\udd4a\ud83d\udd4a     \n\ud83d\udd4a\ud83d\udd4a\ud83d\udd4a\n\nI\u2019m so messed up right now. \nThey killed Brandon. \nHe was such a reformed person. So hopeful and positive until the end. More importantly he is sorry, so sorry for the hurt and pain he has caused others. We didn\u2019t say goodbye bc we wanted to be hopeful that we would talk again, we said talk to you soon! \ud83d\udc94 When he told me he\u2019s claustrophobic and they offered to give him a shot of Sedative to calm him down before they put him in the chair and he just didn\u2019t want to panic, I literally lost it. I had to mute my phone so he wouldn\u2019t hear me cry like that \ud83d\ude2d Just spoke to Brandon for what will likely be the last time. Hardest call I\u2019ve ever had. Brandon, selfless as always, was focused on his family and making sure they are ok. He told me not to cry because our fight isn\u2019t over. \ud83d\ude22 They are premeditating his murder and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it!!! 1 hour until Brandon Bernard will be executed. It\u2019s #HumanRightsDay and here in the United States we are executing someone who was 18 at the time of the crime, was not the shooter and has rehabilitated himself. So shameful. \ud83d\udc94 I stand by what I have always said, I can empathize and feel pain for the victims and their families.  Killing Brandon will not bring them back and I believe in my heart of hearts killing him isn\u2019t right. What Brandon did was wrong, but killing him won\u2019t make things right. 2 hours until Brandon Bernard is executed. My heart breaks for everyone involved, including the victims families and in no way am I diminishing the loss their family has been through. Terrible news from the 7th circuit: \n\nIT IS ORDERED that the Emergency Motion for Stay of Execution Pending Appeal is\nDENIED.\n\nThis is why judges matter. #SaveBrandonBernard Brandon Bernard will be executed in 3 hours. \ud83d\udc94 4 hours until Brandon Bernard will be executed \ud83d\udc94 Something special I learned about #BrandonBernard is that in addition to his work with youth, he also really likes to crochet. He told me this week he wishes he had more time before his execution so he could crochet me a blanket. Brandon Bernard will be executed in 5 hours and all I can think about is his family and children and how they will feel when their loved one is gone. \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\udc94 Been crying all morning. Brandon Bernard will be executed in 6 hours. For #HumanRightsDay let\u2019s take a moment to recognize the humanity of the men and women living behind bars here in the United States. I\u2019ve met a lot of incredible people inside prisons and jails. What\u2019s something special about someone you know who is or has been incarcerated? Learn about Brandon Bernard https://t.co/YWMD6sZXs6 If executed tomorrow, Brandon will die having never been able to touch his children.\u00a0\u00a0All his visits with them have been behind glass, though this has not deterred him from being the best father he can be from prison. https://t.co/aMPBr1As1w How can you help save Brandon\u2019s life?\u00a0\u00a0You can tweet @realDonaldTrump and ask him to #SaveBrandonBernard. https://t.co/kAfoi4oFxP #BrandonBernard should not be executed:\n1. He was 18 at the time.\n2. He was not the shooter.\n3. The prosecutor and 5 of the jurors now support clemency.\n4. He\u2019s spent decades in prison w/out a write up, helping at risk youth.\n5. There\u2019s bipartisan support for his commutation. https://t.co/18GugdtuOs 24 hours until Brandon Bernard is executed. Please keep calling and asking @realDonaldTrump to commute his sentence!\n\n(202) 456-1414\n\nhttps://t.co/EuUlsrjF7v conservatives agree- Brandon Bernard should not be executed. https://t.co/54o1bpNRHc Most of the time executions happen, in our names, without a lot of attention given to them.\u00a0\u00a0This is unacceptable.\u00a0\u00a0For the next 24 hours I will be tweeting about Brandon and his case and why his life should be spared by @realDonaldTrump.

I now think he should live. https://t.co/kaXhVpke8a HOW YOU CAN HELP\nFor more info about the case &amp; to let President Trump know that you think Brandon's death sentence is unjust, please visit https://t.co/fhZYqGv11I &amp; add your name to the letter asking that Brandon's death sentence is commuted to life imprisonment #HelpSaveBrandon He has now been on death row for 20+ years with zero disciplinary write ups. He uses his time to reach out to at-risk youth, advising them to not stray from the Lord's path (or not follow in his teenage footsteps). Although all five teens were black, 11 of the 12 jurors were white.\u00a0 This, coupled with the misleading and incomplete information the jury was given, deprived the boys of a fair trial.\n\nInstead of being executed, Brandon could live out\u00a0his sentence in prison. Recently the prosecutor herself- the person who helped put Brandon on death row- has also come forward and\nasked that his life be spared since he was the least culpable of the five teens involved. In fact, two jurors who \u00a0have since stated that had they learned about Brandon's background or how at just a few months past 18 his brain was still developing, they would NOT have voted for the death penalty. or how his homeless father had left him searching for protection in the streets.\n\nHis trial attorney also failed to tell the jury how remorseful\u00a0he was or anything\u00a0about his background.\u00a0 We now know this testimony would have spared his life. At trial Brandon's attorney fell short by not\u00a0hiring any experts who could have explained to the jury why Brandon decided\u00a0to leave the video game store that night or how he had grown up in an abusive home, The gunman then turned to Brandon, gun still in hand, and told him to light the car Todd and Stacie lay in on fire to destroy the evidence.\u00a0 Brandon believed both were dead, though Stacie was not, and was fearful for his own life, so he made the terrible decision to comply. In fact, Brandon was not a part of the initial carjacking that took place and was stunned when the robbery turned into a homicide with one of the other teens shooting both Todd and Stacie in the head. While Brandon did participate in this crime, his role was minor compared to that of the other teens involved,\u00a0two of whom are home from prison now. First, I want to say that a terrible crime was committed\u00a0and me fighting for a stay of execution does not take away from the sympathy I have for the victim's Todd and Stacie Bagley, and their families.\u00a0 My heart breaks for everyone involved. A terrible case has been brought to my attention and I need your help.\u00a0 Without it, on December 12th Brandon Bernard is going to be executed for a crime he participated in as a teenager. https://t.co/PkbpAprMbv 2020 as a photo \ud83d\ude02 https://t.co/3clULyFtoW Pack a backpack with toys, school and art supplies, personal care items, clothing and accessories, a personal note, and more, and gift it to a child displaced by the war in Artsakh.

I can only imagine how hard this is and my intention is never to open up this painful wound but to help find the truth behind this tragedy. Today I\u2019m teaming up with @MonicaDenise, @JessicaJackson and @EdyHaney to #FreeCoreyMiller True justice for the young man requires that the person who actually killed him be held responsible and that Corey Miller he returned home to his kids. Since his trial, witnesses have recanted, new evidence of his potential innocence has come to light, and there are claims of jurors being pressured into voting to convict. The jury convicted Corey 10-2 and he was sentenced him to life in prison. If his trial was today, the jury would have had to be unanimous for him to be convicted. #FreeCoreyMiller\n\nOn January 18, 2002 a tragedy occurred when a young man was killed. The next day Corey Miller was arrested for the murder. RT @KKWFRAGRANCE: LAST DAY to enter the @KylieJenner by KKW Fragrance giveaway!
