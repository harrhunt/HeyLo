Head to https://t.co/Z1ZSzQNxNn to get covered. Overall, the American Rescue Plan is expanding coverage and lowering costs for countless Americans \u2014 giving people the peace of mind that comes with access to quality, affordable care. It gives states the opportunity to extend coverage for a year to low-income women who have recently given birth, as well as cover community-based crisis intervention services for people experiencing a behavioral health crisis with additional Medicaid funding. The bill incentivizes states to expand coverage to an additional 4 million people with low incomes. It provides additional Medicaid funding to states to help strengthen their home and community-based services programs, which will help older adults and people with disabilities get the care they need in their homes during this critical time. The bill establishes more generous tax credits to the nearly 9 million Americans receiving financial assistance to purchase Marketplace coverage. The American Rescue Plan ensures no one will pay more than 8.5% of their income on their premium. For example, a family of four making $90,000 will see their premiums decrease by $200/ month. President Biden believes every single American deserves access to quality, affordable health care.
