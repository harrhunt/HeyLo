Timmy D the legend https://t.co/tVjnZFHi48 Can't stand for it anymore because of I \u2764\ufe0f and will die right now for my Sport and for SPORTS in general. #JustMyOpinion are out there please stop worrying about u and if u really care for the kid give them the guidance as my Coaches, mentors did for me!..... We need to be pushed, kicked, loved, then pushed and kicked again cause that's what brings and breads the hunger inside of us! Whoever u.... on how much they can benefit in the long run from the kid not realizing they're cheating the shit out of the kid. We as kids don't know..... won't get on them because their afraid of losing the kid, or losing the sponsorship that comes with the kids, or have their own agenda...... Reason I'm saying this is I believe this is a major part of the reason why kids don't succeed as much because the leaders, coaches, etc..... they showed toughness and stayed on me every single day! Never sugar coded nothing, told me to real and lit me up when I wasn't applying.... Man if it wasn't for Big Frank, Bruce Kelker, Willie Earl, @CoachDambrot @CoachDruJoyce I wouldn't be the player/man I am today! As a kid... Humbled, but this goes to the parents raising, teachers educating &amp; partners supporting my kids.
