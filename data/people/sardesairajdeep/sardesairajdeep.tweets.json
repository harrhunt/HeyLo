So, no debate!\ud83d\ude4f The best thing about New Education Policy: it says education will get 6% of GDP as against the present 1.7 per cent (quality needs to be focus now). overall, a policy that should be welcomed for its intent to at least take a serious look at a sector needing urgent reform.. \ud83d\udc4d RT @IndiaToday: Will choked credit flow trigger banking crisis in India's post-Covid economy?

Tough call.. don\u2019t also forget Prasanna has best record of any Indian offie in Australia, so maybe he would come into reckoning too. Not to forget Chandra! My team: Gavaskar, Sehwag, Dravid,Sachin,Virat, Dhoni, Kapil, Ashwin, Kumble, Zaheer, Bedi. If Match played abroad, Srinath replaces Ashwin, and Vishwanath/Laxman for Bedi if it\u2019s a tough wicket at Joburg/Perth.

Good to see @abpmajhatv journalist Rahul Kulkarni get bail. I have been critical of the way story was pitched but there is no way he committed a \u2018crime\u2019 he is being accused of. This is moment to show solidarity. Focus should be on media who commits \u2018real\u2019 crime: hate speech! @ShashiTharoor @RahulGandhi @INCIndia Yes. I think he got the broad template right. Which is also why states with the better district health centres will be more effective. @ShashiTharoor @RahulGandhi @INCIndia I can only speak for myself. I genuinely feel fighting Covid is about TEAM India  with some of the best suggestions and models coming well beyond Delhi, in state capitals! The problem with any analysis of @RahulGandhi is that whatever he says, BJP IT cell will ridicule him as \u2018Pappu\u2019 and the Cong IT cell will dub him their \u2018Future\u2019. Very difficult to have a dispassionate analysis in polarised times: atleast war on corona must be bipartisan! Agree? A quick take of @RahulGandhi presser a) spoke in right tone without stridency b) focussed on right issues: testing, fin package,migrants,SMEs, empowering CMs, PPEs c) took qs in PC. BUT d)needs to be more bilingual; e) unclear if he is speaking as de facto Cong Prez or an MP? @BoriaMajumdar My Qs for @MirzaSania .

It was a proposal, yes reporter needed to exercise caution before going with news. But was he \u2018sole\u2019 reason for the trouble and was there any mala fide intent? Maha govt/mumbai police must do a swift inquiry. Troubled by arrest of @abpmajhatv journalist in Mumbai migrant case.

No Olympics medals for corona testing but it\u2019s time to ensure much more testing right across India: centre needs to ensure more rapid testing kits for ALL states! Walk the talk! https://t.co/L0octAEUwR @shahid_siddiqui Sir, neither does the virus know a religion nor does the healer. A constant theme of @PMOIndia addresses to the nation: ask not what state can do for you.. ask what you can do for the state..#Lockdown2 PM @narendramodi has shifted onus to fighting corona well and truly onto the states right down to the district admin, whether it\u2019s on social distancing or testing. Centre needs to now provide massive financial resources/cut bureaucracy, encourage better coordination. #Lockdown2 Extending #Lockdown2 was inevitable. What is needed is a concrete plan of action to isolate \u2018hotspots\u2019 while creating spaces for movement of goods and people in other parts. That seems to be strategy: challenge is for state govts to execute. Battle will not be won at the centre. PM makes relaxation of lockdown 2.0 conditional. Carrot and stick policy: will have to await what carrot really is when the guidelines are made public tomw. Till then, jury is out on how to balance lives and livelihood. Gareeb/kisan need more than fine words, nuts/bolts needed. Perhaps no Indian has had the impact on post independence Indian polity quite like him:on Ambedkar Jayanti, remembering the remarkable social and political visionary, and an intellect and revolutionary who saw the future.. Jai Bhimrao: May his legacy ensure a more equal India.\ud83d\ude4f Have to appreciate that the Delhi govt is being transparent with its Covid numbers.. a few other states need to follow suit.. test more, report more. @ArvindKejriwal @msisodia @SatyendarJain https://t.co/GV5bi8sTCx @saxenafida Happy birthday.

Maha health min joins me. @IndiaToday News without the noise @D_Roopa_IPS Great to use it for corona ma\u2019am. But who  is to say the mighty Indian state won\u2019t use it to build a post corona surveillance society? You are the powerful state: your job is to maintain law and order, my job will remain to ask Qs of those in power. From March 13 to 21, Delhi govt issued a series of orders restricting social/ religious gatherings. Markaz was in violation of each and every one of them. They must be held accountable. My other Qs: why did the local police not act on March 13 itself and disperse the gathering? Not at all. I have praised efforts of health ministry under @drharshvardhan leadership.We can endlessly debate whether more could have been done earlier: battling corona not easy. Fact is,when @RahulGandhi raised issue in Feb, he was mocked by govt supporters for being alarmist. https://t.co/Ht0cWbbcyg Well done Karnataka in these corona times! Although I hope it doesn\u2019t lead to an even greater surveillance society in the future! \ud83d\ude4f https://t.co/mRojdPBIjC Have gone through Markaz response  to corona crisis: Reveals complete lack of civic responsibility by Tableegi to have held large meet on March 13.And admin failed to stop it.Then again, top netas were holding large weddings, VIP holi celebs, even parliament was on at same time! I know this will be seen as troll bait but @RahulGandhi was probably the first national politician to warn of an impending corona crisis on Feb 12. Then he was typically mocked at. Had we acted swiftly then on visas and travel restrictions, things might have been better?Agree?

All Goenkars need to stand up. Please see below https://t.co/dLHvUEZu7t We need to question both Markaz and law enforcement authorities. The gathering was BEFORE lockdown. Why was it not dispersed by SDM/police? Why did clerics not ensure crowds were asked to leave right away? What were checks in place? How do you deal with congested localities? https://t.co/Swj50J4vjk I was waiting for RW to link corona to religion. The tragic deaths of people after a Tableegi Jamaat congregation has provided that chance. To link corona to religion when thousands across the world ACROSS religions are dying is INHUMAN. Let\u2019s for once keep religion out of this. \u2018The virus decides the timeline of a lockdown, not the govt\u2019: top doctors tell us why no timeline can be given for corona https://t.co/10LeDeZpix It was a meeting of the Tableeghi Jamaat: now if you think religion had anything to do with the virus spread , then god save you and people like you. I will show a spine, will you show a heart?? https://t.co/tABzB0rE5H As @KTRTRS admitted today the corona virus knows no geographical, caste, religious boundaries.

Tragic and extremely worrying.. several hundred others who attended will be tracked/quarantined.. FIR being filed in case.. area sealed.

Utterly shameful of local officials in Bareilly: \u2018chemical bath\u2019 by spraying disinfectants on returning migrant workers instead of on the bus. Officials have been suspended now after video went viral: exposes the mindset of authorities when dealing with the poor. https://t.co/fuenv5z5DU So 2 Delhi senior officers suspended, 2 more served notice by Centre without even informing the AAP state govt!

So within minutes of PM speech, long queues outside grocery stores making nonsense of \u2018social distancing\u2019. The panic is natural.

But the scale of the challenge needs pro active state intervention like Kerala is doing at the moment. The affluent are worried about no summer holiday in Europe and no IPL; the middle class are worried about salary cuts, no eating out, no cinema and yes, no IPL. The poor have the real problem: no livelihood. They need ACTION and SUPPORT, not FINE WORDS: state must act NOW!

Suprabhatam.. we've worked very hard to bring you a ground report from across riot scarred North East Delhi, a riot that has left BOTH communities wounded. And the police under fire. Do watch! https://t.co/v6CbqeF3Vx @shashj @MannkibaatRajiv It is heart breaking which is why the only solution is to discover the human touch in a deeply polarised society. And that will come from empathy not hate. Netaon ne zahar bhar diya hai.:  never was a truer word spoken.. listen to this man who has lost his all and ask/ what will it take to stop the madness? #GroundZero https://t.co/YdqqNsAYWP @srivatsayb Don\u2019t have guts to say it? Sorry, then you are clueless about my journalism over 30 years: from Mumbai 92-93 to Gujarat 2002 and more, have called a spade a spade. But neither am I going to be a prisoner of political correctness: I will report what I see. Now, good night @srivatsayb So here is the truth. 'Peaceful' protestors armed with guns and petrol bombs attacked from one side, and well organised groups with state machinery support attacked from the other. What you call 'balancing' is hard reality: get used to it. Ground Zero north east Delhi.. travels through an area scarred by communal riots. https://t.co/v6CbqeF3Vx @angadthakur That\u2019s very kind of you to say this. Thank you RT @angadthakur: Tonight's report on the #DelhiRiots by @sardesairajdeep was some of the finest, most responsible journalism I've seen on I\u2026 Thank you. But truthfully, our propaganda noise channels have long \u2018killed\u2019 tv news. https://t.co/saJTipe30i I wish. Sadly the future is more studio crap I fear. https://t.co/caJ3Lcp28y Mr Pai.. I normally have stopped responding to you. But this time after a day on the street I will: a) suggest you watch our ground reports b) suggest you actually help people of BOTH communities instead of your one sided crap c) stop giving gyaan on twitter and come on ground. https://t.co/g5IGKvyvdv Final point: no riot of this kind takes place without the complicity or incompetence of the state machine. On ground zero, there is evidence of both which is most disturbing. A SC led inquiry needed to name and shame the culprits, howsoever powerful. Criminal elements in certain pockets took over the streets on Monday.. the easy access to guns, petrol bombs became a lethal weapon to spread fear and violence. The violence was targeted with a fair amount of preparation. Local politicians like Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur added fuel to the fire with their hate speeches. A Waris Pathan speech too was seen to have incited violence. No one on ground to counter the hate speech/toxic propaganda. Communities badly divided across neighbourhoods. The police role needs to be investigated. Cops were outnumbered on Monday, ill prepared with no clear directive to act firmly. By Tuesday, cops accused of siding with one community as the retaliatory cycle got worse. After spending a day on streets of NE Delhi,my takeaways 1) this is a Hindu Muslim riot in which BOTH communities have been involved in terrible acts of violence. Street Protests, provocation, attack, retaliation, a cycle of violence was unleashed.Tough to say who \u2018started\u2019 it. @nishantshekhar1 \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Thank you dost.

Hope the book is republished one day for today\u2019s India @tajmahalfoxtrot https://t.co/YEOJKzEOTD Suprabhatam! Life is too short to worry about haters. They don't deserve to be an issue in your life. Think about the people who love and support you. Have a good day friends. @digvijaya_28 2012 October sir. My take: Many more Nagaurs before we wake up to the reality of caste violence https://t.co/ygHJEz2TOm Don\u2019t recall ever having him on a show I have done.. https://t.co/QCJ4yn8sqY @rpsinghkhalsa Thanks for the certificate sir!\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb News Today: 9 pm Shocker in Nagaur: what will it take to stop atrocities against Dalits? Shaheen Bagh impasse; Trump\u2019s Ahmedabad extravaganza: whose footing the bill? Tragedy on KamalHaasan film set.. and more.. @IndiaToday tv In 2019 assembly polls, @warispathan lost by more than 50,000 votes. People rejected him, TV/social media will now prop him up for making inflammatory remarks. Reject all those who speak language of religious extremism. Deny them oxygen of publicity they so desperately crave! @MehekF Get your facts right sir. Incident happened on 16th. Efforts were on to hush up the matter. If video had not gone viral, culprits might have got away again.. time to wake up: forget BJP, Cong, AAP, a crime is a crime that needs swift action. Good to hear.. the punishment must be swift and exemplary.. https://t.co/Z2lq5iA3ey \u092f\u0939 video \u0926\u0947\u0916\u0915\u0930 shock \u0939\u094b\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948..

Qs is: when will we get new MPs?\ud83d\ude0a https://t.co/D8NEq1FKGn @Kishan561 You are too kind!\ud83d\ude4f Last night,as we debated state of economy at Montek Singh book event, I raised qs about failings of UPA 2 on banks, handling coalition pressures etc. Manmohan Singh sat in front  row, listened intently.End of debate told me: that was a good debate.Didn\u2019t call me anti national!\ud83d\ude0a https://t.co/KB98G9mZ0M News Today: may wish to watch: the big economy debate with @PChidambaram_IN @bibekdebroy , Montek Singh Ahluwalia and YV Reddy. One of those days when you can listen without the noise of tv! https://t.co/50UfihyOlM @JatinGu23176901 Yes thanks! @ckknaturals @redwinsamuel @sagarikaghose Was great to meet!\ud83d\udc4d Honoured to write a chapter on @imVkohli for this collector\u2019s item book. Grab your copy of the book on the 40 sporting game changers! @sportstarweb https://t.co/ZQl4A8cLJK Don\u2019t miss 9 pm: the big economy debate: with Montek Singh, @PChidambaram_IN , @bibekdebroy and YV Reddy.. @IndiaToday tv https://t.co/IDvctNWPnB \u2018I am saving the BIG trade deal with India for later\u2019 says US Prez @realDonaldTrump  : that\u2019s like saying \u2018am coming to take a selfie at Taj, am going to this Ahmedabad place of yours, now be a good boy, agree to all our conditions and Uncle Sam will give you a back present!\u201d \ud83d\ude0a I love the way every public figure  pays homage to Shivaji Maharaj on his birth anniversary and then undermine his legacy in so many different ways almost every day! Let\u2019s embrace the great Chatrapati\u2019s values before we build more statues in his name! Jai Shivaji!\ud83d\ude4f Finally, watched the original Badshah song. My friend @PradeepGuptaAMI actually could give SRK a run for his money on dance moves! Have a look.. gnight shubhratri! https://t.co/mbiYdTCHMg News Today: news without the noise.. https://t.co/3XlHVoWEFx My take on Shaheen Bagh mediation: time for the 'beauty of compromise' https://t.co/VUS7fl9YDt Yeh kahan aa gaye hum... \ud83d\ude02 https://t.co/wBjSTcETGn Why doesn\u2019t the Delhi police open up the road near Shaheen Bagh and allow the protest to continue in a corner of the area? By putting up endless barricades, the police actually is making it even more difficult to find a workable solution.. or is the aim not to find a solution? RT @IndiaToday: British Labour Party MP @Debbie_abrahams, whose visa was revoked by Indian government, speaks exclusively to India Today.\u2026 Because true journalism demands that every side has a right to be heard; else we might as well all be embedded with the government. https://t.co/blTFgVnNKI This is good stuff guys! Take a look!! https://t.co/b7B0xgGJ0T Whatever former Mumbai cop Rakesh Maria has said about Kasab using a fake identity card is already in 26/11 chargesheet. Now if only we read the chargesheet we might educate ourselves about the plot! Today\u2019s good news story!!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a https://t.co/htXnykZKli @vimoh @TheLallantop @saurabhtop You obviously want us to live on love and fresh air with zero ads! Ha ha! Look forward to meeting! \ud83d\ude0a https://t.co/c2gGvKK5jI @ranjini_2 @airvistara @kunalkamra88 Thank you!\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Another reason to love @airvistara .. apart from the fact that the airline did not join the mindless rush to ban a @kunalkamra88 from flying on a minister\u2019s instructions https://t.co/s26raFVNEO @raghav355 That\u2019s a fair observation. With one caveat: striking difference between VS and LS elections suggest that voters now have limited loyalty to anyone . Our post poll survey shows 48 per cent of BJP voters in LS voted for AAP in VS. @TVMohandasPai Communal politics of AAP? Didn\u2019t hear AAP scream \u2018desh ke gaddar\u2019, biryani for Shaheen Bagh, India Vs Pakistan! Fact is, Kejriwal didn\u2019t fall into secular communal trap; fact is 60 pc women voted for AAP: yes, \u2018welfarism\u2019 was a huge factor (what you call freebies!). Reading Montek Singh Ahluwalia\u2019s book \u2018Backstage\u2019 2 things stand out: a) early 90s under PVNR saw the finest constellation of economic minds come together; b) despite his experience,Dr Singh as PM never hesitated to consult experts. Both valuable lessons for today\u2019s leadership."}
