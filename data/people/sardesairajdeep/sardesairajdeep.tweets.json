RIP Tragic news coming from Mumbai: one of the real personalities of cricket and commentary, the Aussie who played that unforgettable innings in Chennai in 1986, Dean Jones has passed away. Loved him on air and at the crease. Saw him last night on @StarSportsIndia RIP. The manner in which a party\u2019s IT cell works in tandem with a \u2018noise\u2019 channel says it all. We are now truly a banana republic where those who are not even journalists target the genuine beat reporters and then seek political support for their loutish behaviour. Sorry, not done!\ud83d\ude4f Glad that Rajasthan high court has stayed a bizarre arrest warrant issued against Arun Shourie in an 18 year old Laxmi Vilas hotel case by a CBI court.

What struck me is what the top criminal lawyer Rizwan Merchant said: NCB functions only in secrecy, here it is doing just the opposite, breaking every rule of a serious investigation. Caged parrot replaced by a publicity hungry, hit job  Rottweiler. @ShamikaRavi Whether these reforms are the right ones I don\u2019t know enough to make a comment. I leave it to experts like all of you: last week I had Prof Ashok Gulati, yday P Sainath. Alternate views. What I do feel though strongly is a bill like this must go thru parliamentary oversight. \ud83d\ude4f The former NCB chief BV Kumar has ripped the lid of the @narcoticsbureau invgn.
