For even more tips, visit: https://t.co/Vgco7yma5R To give you more control over who can contact you on Instagram, there\u2019s a new way to limit who can send you direct messages. The feature lets only the people you follow message you and add you to group threads. https://t.co/UyhOpcCAZG We also want to help stop bullying before it happens. If someone writes a potentially offensive comment or caption, they\u2019ll get a prompt saying it\u2019s similar to content that\u2019s been reported for bullying. We\u2019ve found this can encourage people to reconsider what they\u2019re posting. ICYMI, we\u2019ve also been rolling out more features to help prevent bullying. When you restrict an account, only they can see their comments on your posts. And they can\u2019t see when you\u2019ve read their direct messages or when you\u2019re active on Instagram. https://t.co/dOBhxFAITO If your account\u2019s been disabled, there\u2019s a new way to appeal in the app. When you try to log in, you\u2019ll see an option to \u201cRequest a Review.\u201d Tap it and we\u2019ll review your disabled account and potentially restore it. We'll roll out these features over the coming weeks. https://t.co/W9r6B7dpau You can also tap \u201cMore Options\u201d for suggested actions \u2013 like muting, blocking or unfollowing accounts you\u2019ve reported. And if you disagree with our decision on the content, you can request a review and we\u2019ll take a second look. Now when you report something that shouldn\u2019t be on Instagram (like bullying or offensive content), you can get updates through Support Requests. It\u2019s a new feature in the app that shows you the status of your reports.
