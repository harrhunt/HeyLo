If they do seek mental health care, we have to call the insurance company aft\u2026 @HighlyFavoredEv Yes, thats exactly what she\u2019s saying and I agree. I\u2019m just pointing out that the healthcare that they recieve has never been with the goal of healing them. They want cops to be unhinged and violent because a hardened cop does the job they want. It being free yet penalized is dumb @Charles99739222 Nah @TheColyerLolyer Thats not true but also, the point I\u2019m making is, there are mentally unwell people working a job where if they tell their employer that they\u2019re sick they will be penalized. So their means of surviving finacially is tied to them hiding trauma and going out to inflict trauma on us RT @justjade_here: Thinking about how CPD is receiving free mental health support but the trauma that they caused keeps me up consistently\u2026 Its also fucked up that they\u2019re penalized for seeking treatment. Officers that become in-patients or report traumatic events are placed on desk duty or have their FOID cards revoked (basically fired). This leaves it to the officers to hide their PTSD.

Flatts and I are all writers. We create our songs. Arnold didn\u2019t add anything to total recall and it could be argued that he lessened the role in lieu of Eddie who is a writer, improviser and director who would\u2019ve definitely killed it. @johnny_k_wuhhh Nah they have very different storylines lol, I mean they\u2019re both sort of about space @danielololol How do yall find all these opportunities to be racist @kylehakk It would make sense if he was a good actor... I guess @Khaki_Blerman @kristianngoma Yea the main point is the role of Quaid/Hauser is played by someone who\u2019s not a dynamic actor. I love Arnold, he kinda plays himself in every movie. Being that Eddie did films where he played a character with an alter ego, and had already done action comedy he woulda kilt it @Khaki_Blerman @kristianngoma Well dynamic actors are just actors that can play roles that differ from each other so I could list the difference in roles like Coming to America, Dream Girls and Bowfinger. Or remind you that he would play multiple characters in one film, or weekly on SNL. @Khaki_Blerman @kristianngoma Cap for the internet \u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f @kristianngoma Total Recall is more of a comedy than most scifi thrillers and Eddie in \u201890 was the man. He\u2019s a dynamic actor with range who can really create and fall into characters which is important when playing 2 sides of 1 character. He also just woulda just brought more \u201ccool\u201d to the role Please rewatch Total Recall (1990) and imagine Eddie Murphy playing Quaid and adlibbing his own jokes and beating people up. *chef\u2019s kiss* Replace Arnold Schwarzenegger with Eddie Murphy and Total Recall would of been top 10 Yes the 1990 one Total Recall is wacky but I like it RT @ThrowbackHoops: Derrick Rose 2015 ECSF Game 3 buzzer beater! https://t.co/QNF1RN6irf RT @ArtThatFeeds: Thank you to everyone who contributed to our last food delivery to Chicago\u2014especially to local community members Michael\u2026 RT @CiCiAdams_: Prisons work to make people disposable.

WS is built on works of the flesh, we can say that. @firstnmnlast What are some examples in this rainbow of supremacy?

I would think war would mean both sides are engaged in a fight. Genocide just denotes mass murder of a group of people @LinoInez Again thats genocide, not a war. @ChocoFIaco @Panterrible1 You\u2019re totally right. To me a war is between two militarized separate sides engaged in a series of battles equally. Most instances involving people of color versus non poc is a genocide and not an actual war @MOZZIEMUTANT @Panterrible1 I agree with you. I saw someone say its called a \u2018revolution\u2019 not a \u201crace war\u201d for a reason. @isaackingmusic @Stephen24745309 Well i should say it wasn\u2019t over the humanity of slaves, it was about cotton trade and political power for the states that wanted to retain their chattel. But it wasn\u2019t for the liberation of black slaves. Moreso just push back from the south against a republican president. I see alot of comments saying they don\u2019t know of any but want to prevent one from happening. Is it possible that maybe \u2018race war\u2019 is a made up thing in our minds to keep us from moving towards real progress. @Panterrible1 I think that may be the best example. Ok. @Stephen24745309 For some reason, I thought the race war meant one race per side. The civil war had slaves and freed blacks on both sides. Also the civil war wasn\u2019t really even about the slaves. Are there any examples of a \u201crace war\u201d in history? I see that word used alot on here. But I\u2019m trying to think of an exapmle in modern history or antiquity and can\u2019t. I can obviously remember the mass genocides based on race, but a \u2018war\u2019 to me signifies two equally engaged sides @90zbabieee @damnromulans @Pringzor I think you may mean \u201clibertarian\u201d @seshpdx I think they had selfish intentions, and apathetically compared the consistent violence black folk encounter with their newfound \u201coppression\u201d under trump.

That includes people who are unwilling to choose sides, or anyone who causes a delay in ending oppression because God is always one-sided, He is never color-blind and He always acts for the oppressed. The Gospel of Jesus Christ IS the liberation of all oppressed people from oppressive forces.. The enemy of the church of the body of Christ is White Supremacy. We must defeat it as a body and remove the spiritual wickedness and dark principalities of hierarchy in the culture. @ComeTogether Yea alot of Chicago purchased their food and clothes before they knew his views on race, sex and white evangelism.

The word \u201cChristian\u201d isn\u2019t used once in the bible. Please read, the body of Christ needs you. @Carl_Aly Just read. @_whos_bad @KANESHAVELI The bible twice says Jesus was hanged by a tree. Again, read. RT @chancetherapper: Twice in the book of Acts, the apostolic preachers say that Jesus was \u201changed on a tree,\u201d and Paul takes the old law t\u2026 @_whos_bad @KANESHAVELI Death doesn\u2019t come quickly in a lynching, I think you need to read more. These words are from an article in Block Island Times by Steve Hollaway and quotes the Black Theologist Dr. James Cone. Heres the full read: https://t.co/f11lWXfOvO Both Jesus and blacks were publicly humiliated, subjected to the utmost indignity and cruelty. They were stripped, in order to be deprived of dignity, then paraded, mocked and whipped, derided and spat upon, tortured for hours in the presence of crowds for popular entertainment. \u201cBoth the cross and the lynching tree were symbols of terror, instruments of torture and execution, reserved primarily for slaves, criminals, and insurrectionists\u2014the lowest of the low in society.\u201d Once you juxtapose those two images in your mind\u2014once you see the man hanging on the old rugged cross next to a man hanging from a regular tree for everyone to gawk at\u2014it\u2019s hard not to see lynchings as 19th and 20th century crucifixions. Twice in the book of Acts, the apostolic preachers say that Jesus was \u201changed on a tree,\u201d and Paul takes the old law that says anyone hanging on a tree is cursed to make the point that Jesus bore the curse for us. But it never crossed our minds that Jesus was like \u201cstrange fruit\u201d \u201cBut second, I think it is shocking to hear that Jesus was lynched because it makes you wonder why such an obvious way to describe what happened to Jesus has never been used in American churches.\u201d \u201cTo hear that word applied to Jesus is shocking, first because the cross has been sanitized in our imagination and turned into a religious symbol. We don\u2019t often think of it as an act of mob violence supported by government and religious authorities.\u201c RT @saintknives: Rioting works.
