Today, Michael Caputo accused the CDC of harboring a \u201cresistance unit\u201d to undermine President Trump. Meaning: let\u2019s lie to the American people about covid So to sum up: The West is burning; the Arctic is melting; the National Hurricane Center is tracking eight major systems; and the WHO reports the largest single-day increase of coronavirus cases globally.\u201d- Wapo. Trump supporters: is this all a hoax? Once again, men are trying to undermine a woman\u2019s authority. In Michigan, @realDonaldTrump\u2019s Republicans are trying to strip @GovWhitmer of her executive powers that have saved thousands of lives during the COVID pandemic. #DeclineToSign their petition called Unlock Michigan! Someone please just tell Republicans that climate change is a woman, so they try and control it. https://t.co/Y0sFm9t5iT Putin is getting everything he wants between Trump and Boris Johnson. Complete anarchy of the west. Destroy our institutions, cause mayhem, and no one does anything about it. Trump supporters seem to not care that Putin is playing with Trump like a dreidel. That\u2019s a Jewish toy. The U.S. is number one in covid cases and #1 in deaths in the world, and Trump supporters want to vote for him again? Do you guys have any idea how preposterous it is that you want to vote for someone who has no regard for the country\u2019s well-being or for you dying?

Climate change- no plan. Women\u2019s rights- take them away. Brown, Black, indigenous people-let then die from covid and prevent them from voting. Trump signs are sickening. RT @TedraCobb: When intelligence reports said Russia was offering bounties to kill US troops in Afghanistan instead of outrage and action,\u2026 And furthermore, Mainers\u2014Maine was not even a part of the Confederacy. So, if you are in Maine, waiving a confederate flag off your porch or car\u2014you are rooting for the losers of the Civil Ear, and you are rooting for slavery. Happy Labor Day to all the people who choose love. As I spend time in Maine, I\u2019m noticing many confederate flags on properties and cars. To be clear, the confederacy was alive for 5 years, and their pursuit was to keep slavery legal in the US\u2014and they lost. It seems many people with confederate flags don\u2019t seem to know this. As long as Trump is president this will continue. Cases in the U.S. rose by 44,452 on Saturday, and the total death toll surpassed 188,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

And a car filled w/ Black Lives Matter protestors plows through the crowd. The\u2026 Trump supporters: this country and the CDC as well as your president had the capability of a targeted national strategy to deal with covid where everyone would be back to work and  back school. He simply has chosen not to.

He is harming Americans every day, and encouraging violence. This is not free speech. He is terrorizing the country he swore to serve. @sarahparkxo @jennythelabrat No, honey. You need to get educated and get information that is accurate. We are in the middle of a pandemic that trump is doing nothing about. People are dying and black people are being murdered by police. Get out of your echo chamber and look around. The discord in today\u2019s America is being caused by Trump. If you are scared and fearful, it is because of him and his supporters who own guns. If you are rich, and are thinking about your taxes, remember that a vote for Trump is a vote for white supremacy. https://t.co/lcHqNktAyo @flwrs2021 @cheesecake1003 @Sempermom91 So, he deserved to be paralyzed? You don\u2019t know where the knife was. More important, why are you so quick to defend the police when someone was paralyzed? No one deserves that. He did not open fire with a gun. Therefore, there was absolutely no reason for officers to shoot. @igloowarriorHM4 You also don\u2019t shoot someone 7 times in an attempt to arrest him. You don\u2019t paralyze suspects or criminals. @bdmaher10 Uhhhhh, nothing. You do not apprehend someone with 7 shots in the back. That is not what police are supposed to do. Period. You don\u2019t shoot people when you have 5 police officers and one person who turns their back. @emmyrossum Hi honey So, Trump supporters who own guns are allowed to walk around the streets and open fire when they see fit, yet an innocent black man who broke up a fight was shot 7 times by police, paralyzed by police, and then handcuffed to his hospital bed\u2014by police.

The Trump administration is planning to end federal support for local coronavirus testing sites across the nation at the end of the month \u2014 including seven in Texas, where confirmed cases of COVID are spiking.

That\u2019s the main objective. It\u2019s the decent and right thing to do. For Republicans who want to constantly bring up the flu: According to new CDC data, the US influenza death rate is .1%, while the Covid-19 death rate is 5.2%. This means that the average death rate for Covid is almost 50 times higher than that of the flu. Everyone who needs help getting to these polling places, Lyft is offering free rides.

It took all schools to be closed and everyone forced to be inside because of a pandemic, but we finally did it. So, to clarify\u2014Donald Trump takes no responsibility for all the states in the country he was elected to represent, yet the World Health Org is to blame. So, don\u2019t look to your president. Blame a global organization that is crucial to preventing the spread of covid-19.

He knew before we had one case and did nothing. @williemgreen I love you too On this Easter I have read and heard too many examples of anti Asian sentiment due to covid-19. What on earth is wrong with people to blame an entire race for a disease? Trump supporters: races don\u2019t cause disease. Your president does. @JoyAnnReid Yes.

It\u2019s the most sane we advice we get all day. Please let our real leaders talk and skip Trump\u2019s update every afternoon. He has proven himself untrustworthy is this crisis. Trump said African Americans are being hit hard by the coronavirus and he \u201cwants to find the reason for it.\u201d Here\u2019s the reason: poverty, access to healthcare, medical neglect because of bias, residential segregation. Because of racism reinforced by old white men like you. Enough of this pandemic-opportunitism abortion bans bullshit. Abortion is an essential service.

To all news organizations: if we are in pursuit of the truth during this extremely scary time, then you need to stop airing Trump\u2019s misinformation briefings each day. If you need content, just rerun Andrew Cuomo\u2019s morning briefings. They\u2019re factual, and I\u2019d watch that twice. I think an ethical and health safety question all news orgs have to ask themselves\u2014Is it responsible to air trump\u2019s briefings every day, when he repeatedly gives Americans false information. We are in a pandemic and you are helping spread his misinformation. You are not Fox. @bigmattson You\u2019re annoying. Trump just instructed the American people to take the HCQ and a zpack, but if you have a heart condition, maybe not the zpack. Isnt it illegal to give medical advice to the public without being a doctor? How is it legal to even air that without a retraction? @HippoCrite5 Do the opposite @agerson24 @mb134eva So stupid If you are living in a red state with no stay at home orders, if you are a Trump voter, and are listening to his advice on staying safe\u2014please don\u2019t.

Since the Republicans are arguing that nothing Trump does can be impeachable, can\u2019t we focus on the fact that he terrorizes gov\u2019t employees, lies every time he speaks, and is a giant fucking asshole? If you\u2019ve ever unsure how to take a stand for the right thing to do \u2014 just look at Susan Collins, then do the opposite.

It\u2019s so sad how evil and destructive he is. And that his supporters have no problem with his behavior and go he treats and disparages people who have devoted their lives to our country. Another day, another lifetime civilian leader discharged by Trump for disagreeing with him. Trump think it\u2019s nice for our naval officers to take pictures with dead bodies, just like he thinks it\u2019s ok to tear families apart and put babies in cages. This is your president. Hitler. Why is there not a legal issue with Rudy Giuliani negotiating on behalf of our country when he is not a cabinet member or even a Trump appointee? He\u2019s Trump\u2019s personal attorney.

I was invited by a friend to a dinner party. Hadn\u2019t met him before and never saw him again. What\u2019s your next question? @LiLfukinMonster Republicans don\u2019t have policies that protect women. Men should not be deciding what we do with our bodies. Republicans don\u2019t care about pay equality or sexual equality, so yeah, I would say, avoid Republicans on the ballot box until they get up to speed. @webberwit And when you think only about yourself and your family and your needs, you are not helping other people I  Thau world. It is not a zero sum game. Caring for others will teach your children to not only look out for themselves. As white women, we have a responsibility to look after all women who are even more marginalized than us. We have to show up for women of color and the LGBTQ community in ways that they have shown up.

Ask your Donald trump. They seem like they have a stronger connection. Trump said Melania actually asked him to help A$AP Rocky. Great, thanks Melania. Now ask him about the kids in cages next.

Babies in cages. Yes, impeach this asshole. Babies are in cages. Cages. What parent of any child would be ok with this? Can we just impeach this moron already? Are we waiting for him to shoot someone on 5th Avenue? Are we waiting for him to be caught with his pants down? His pants have been down for 3 years. We are dealing with a racist who is actively engaging his base in racism. No more.

We can do this! \ud83d\udc6f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc6f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Here are more great candidates I spent yesterday with who can flip their red seats blue! @MikeLevinCA @katieporteroc @KatieHill4CA https://t.co/8svImCGT7M @Tristanshouts @Guy4Progress @emilyslist Amen @FluffyMikeB @emilyslist Please stop saying voting for women because they are women is wrong. These are women who are qualified and endorsed by @emilyslist. You don\u2019t get that endorsement without being qualified. @dacohenz @emilyslist You can watch the last two years of my NETFLIX show on Netflix. It\u2019s called Chelsea! @ReadySetRock75 @emilyslist Thanks, buddy. I admire all of you guys right back. We all stick together and vote! Good news: YouTube, Facebook, Apple and Spotify are all banning Alex Jones and Infowars. Bad news: He\u2019ll either get a job offer from Fox News or Donald Trump. Here are all the \u2066@emilyslist\u2069 endorsed candidates that will be on the ballot tomorrow in the state of Washington. # https://t.co/cJ2FfpbRc8 RT @BlueWaveCS: Tuesday, August 7 is Primary Election Day for #KS, #MI, #MO, #WA and a Special Election in #OH12\n\n#CommitToVote\n\nIf you exp\u2026 This election is tomorrow and every vote matters.

We need to fight. Call our senators and if you can, show up. Roe v. Wade will set us back 50 years. https://t.co/XXi4W0OWv2 @Justinxv @cmclymer That\u2019s nice for you to apologize @yanks3202 Oh, sorry. I liked having a president who doesn\u2019t threaten random people, countries, and world leaders on twitter. I liked having a president who didn\u2019t fuck pornstars and lie about it. I liked having a president that could speak in complete sentences. This is our man for Ohio #12 this Tuesday. @dannyoconnor1 https://t.co/a8evBMCC4V @RepCummings You\u2019re an incredible representative. Thank you for fearless, indefatigable leadership.

Ohio- your election is 5 days away. @dannyoconnor1 is the guys for OHIO #12 we need new representative in Congress. People who aren\u2019t sponsored by the NRA or Russia. Let\u2019s clean house and start with some real American candidates. https://t.co/o0vf5WsHnP Trump claimed that Americans need photo ID to buy groceries. I guess that\u2019s the kind of logic you develop when the only thing you\u2019re used to buying is the silence of the women you had affairs with. Trump believes that people are voting illegally, but also wants to make sure that all American citizens of color who are legally voting should have their votes suppressed. That\u2019s quite a policy. These 7 @emilyslist endorsed candidates are running for seats in districts House Republicans won by 10 points or fewer in 2016. @AngieCraigMN @karaforcongress @Abby4Iowa @KatieHill4CA @GinaOrtizJones @DonnaShalala @JenniferWexton https://t.co/rwScJLd3cV RT @bengleib: Do u realize how INSANE this is?\n40% of Republicans are ok with 1 of our biggest adversaries interfering in our elections, de\u2026 Can this country please stand for anything other than Russia and guns? https://t.co/OpAFAsUQNf Republicans say yes to 3D GUNS. https://t.co/QOhbEIvlyU After looking at these photos of Melania and Donald Trump Jr., I feel most sorry for the photographer. https://t.co/ozK65xBGHE Instead of guns, can we print a 3D jail to put Donald Trump in now? https://t.co/OpmwB3rh2U RT @old_osc: We should have legislation that requires 3-D printer companies to take active measures to stop the printer from being able to\u2026 Please join me in Los Angeles this Sunday, August 5, to meet Southern California\u2019s Democratic nominees - @KatieHill4CA @katieporteroc @MikeLevinCA https://t.co/p7KwlNuXZQ Ohio- you have an election next Tuesday and this is the guy running in Ohio\u2019s 12th that we want to win.

Both of them can turn crucial red seats blue, bringing the total number of @emilyslist's red to blue House candidates up to 43. Remember, we only need 23 to take back the House. I love that Bob Mueller was in the airport at the same gate as Donald Duck Jr. It\u2019s like foreshadowing. And, on a Friday? Good Shabbos! Court documents reveal Paul Manafort reportedly spent $18,000 on karaoke equipment. So I think we all know who will be winning the prison talent show Can @Twitter just remove Trump\u2019s account, already? No leader of any country should be tweeting threats to people and other countries. That would actually force him to talk more and explain policies and answer questions on tape, and we all know how that goes. Here\u2019s another great candidate who is running in OHIO\u2019s 12th district on August 7th. Please check him out and vote! https://t.co/q2GGeSmgHa It\u2019s crazy to think that Betsy DeVos will be reunited with her $40 million yacht before the families at the border. RT @ememess: This administration seems a lot more interested in reuniting Trump and Putin  than in reuniting the families they tore apart.\u2026 Quick question: Is the man who vandalized Trump\u2019s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame single? @nicolenovak @emilyslist @gretchenwhitmer @AbdulElSayed Whitmer has a stronger chance of winning the general election. All branches of government are Republican in Michigan. If he wins, i will support him in the general, but she has a better shot at winning. @aubrey_kapcsos @emilyslist Thank you! @nicolenovak @emilyslist @gretchenwhitmer @AbdulElSayed I did check him out and Whitmer has a much better chance of winning the general election. She is running moderately because in Michigan, all 3 branches are Republican, and they are more likely to vote for moderate Democrats. Each state is deferent Here is a list of all the \u2066@emilyslist\u2069 endorsed candidates that have elections coming up on August 7th. And yes, they are all women because \u2066@emilyslist\u2069 works hard to find women who are pro-choice, pro gun-reform and who will vote to overturn Citizens United. \ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udfff https://t.co/oc4bGZhmS5 This is our guy in TX-32.

Pure evil. How is it not our right to know what happened when trump and Putin were alone? How do we not know they were planning on how to hack the midterms? Because trump said that he reprimanded Putin in private? That\u2019s about as believeable as me reprimanding @RoundaRousey in a ring. Trump supporters: are you okay with him considering offering up American diplomats to Russia? That is acting in the best interest of America?
