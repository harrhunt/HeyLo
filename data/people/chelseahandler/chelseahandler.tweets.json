Happy Labor Day to all the people who choose love. As I spend time in Maine, I\u2019m noticing many confederate flags on properties and cars. To be clear, the confederacy was alive for 5 years, and their pursuit was to keep slavery legal in the US\u2014and they lost. It seems many people with confederate flags don\u2019t seem to know this.

Please ask yourself this question: https://t.co/VcIWFjKbJA Today is #BlackOutDay2020. It's an economic protest against police brutality and racial injustice. Hit these billionaires where it matters most. If you need something today, buy it from a black-owned business. Then keep buying it from that black-owned business moving forward. Looking very much forward to reading this. @TiffanyDCross https://t.co/Tj6PrTFoN8 @TonyC_007 I can\u2019t take it. It\u2019s the worst The administration is looking for the leaker who told us that Russia is putting bounties on our military. They\u2019re not looking for ways to punish Russia. They\u2019re not looking at the team of people who knew and did nothing to protect our soldiers. They are looking for the leaker. @benshapiro No, he actually didn\u2019t say that. Yay!

For Republicans who want to constantly bring up the flu: According to new CDC data, the US influenza death rate is .1%, while the Covid-19 death rate is 5.2%.

It took all schools to be closed and everyone forced to be inside because of a pandemic, but we finally did it. So, to clarify\u2014Donald Trump takes no responsibility for all the states in the country he was elected to represent, yet the World Health Org is to blame. So, don\u2019t look to your president. Blame a global organization that is crucial to preventing the spread of covid-19.

He knew before we had one case and did nothing. @williemgreen I love you too On this Easter I have read and heard too many examples of anti Asian sentiment due to covid-19.

It\u2019s the most sane we advice we get all day. Please let our real leaders talk and skip Trump\u2019s update every afternoon. He has proven himself untrustworthy is this crisis. Trump said African Americans are being hit hard by the coronavirus and he \u201cwants to find the reason for it.\u201d Here\u2019s the reason: poverty, access to healthcare, medical neglect because of bias, residential segregation. Because of racism reinforced by old white men like you. Enough of this pandemic-opportunitism abortion bans bullshit. Abortion is an essential service.

To all news organizations: if we are in pursuit of the truth during this extremely scary time, then you need to stop airing Trump\u2019s misinformation briefings each day. If you need content, just rerun Andrew Cuomo\u2019s morning briefings. They\u2019re factual, and I\u2019d watch that twice. I think an ethical and health safety question all news orgs have to ask themselves\u2014Is it responsible to air trump\u2019s briefings every day, when he repeatedly gives Americans false information. We are in a pandemic and you are helping spread his misinformation. You are not Fox. @bigmattson You\u2019re annoying. Trump just instructed the American people to take the HCQ and a zpack, but if you have a heart condition, maybe not the zpack. Isnt it illegal to give medical advice to the public without being a doctor? How is it legal to even air that without a retraction? @HippoCrite5 Do the opposite @agerson24 @mb134eva So stupid If you are living in a red state with no stay at home orders, if you are a Trump voter, and are listening to his advice on staying safe\u2014please don\u2019t.

I\u2019m at the Wisdom 2.0 conf listening to speakers talk about healing through psychedelics for PTSD for veterans . Palestinians and Israelis are doing this to heal together and think about the \u201cus\u201d instead of the \u201cme.\u201d Pence and Trump might benefit from LSD, MDMA, and mushrooms. On a more serious note- Happy #InternationalWomenDay2020 to all you amazing women out there. Well, almost all of you. Most of you. Not Ivanka. Today is #InternationalWomenDay2020 \u2014 so take a little time to thank the women around you\u2014 and if you can\u2019t find a woman around you, it\u2019s probably because you work in Trump\u2019s administration.

The black people who were released from prison were never criminals to begin with. They had low level drug possessions.

Then he came make some legit cash instead of the bribes he\u2019s taking now. Everybody wins! While our president exonerates criminals and releases them from jail, notice what color they all are.

They have shown that they lie, cheat, and cover up.  They will cheat in 2020. We must vote them out and vote in the super majority. Activate. Get people voting. The theme of 2020 is Republican women disappointing other women. Please welcome newest member, Lisa Murkowski. The framers of the Constitution could come down from the sky, walk into Congress and tell everyone what a scumbag DONALD trump is, and that yes, he should be removed from office\u2014and Republicans would say the framers have never been credible, and they\u2019re mad because they died. Since the Republicans are arguing that nothing Trump does can be impeachable, can\u2019t we focus on the fact that he terrorizes gov\u2019t employees, lies every time he speaks, and is a giant fucking asshole? If you\u2019ve ever unsure how to take a stand for the right thing to do \u2014 just look at Susan Collins, then do the opposite. Republicans are fine with Trump tearing down the FBI, The DOJ, his daily lies, pushing out ambassadors, not having witnesses testify about his guilt. What kind of political party is this? Russian.
