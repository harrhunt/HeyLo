I received incredible guidance from Dr Stacy Smith and Dr Kate Pieper. \ud83d\ude4c @moorehn On subsequent films we hope that\u2018ll be the case but there\u2019s actually quite a lot of red tape involved - so this seemed like the simplest and quickest solution.

Personal protective gear (PPE) is essential. And healthcare workers simply don\u2019t have it. These are the days. These are the helpers. Let\u2019s help the helpers.

I\u2019m a musician, not a Grammy nominated mathematician. As a Grammy nominee, I always say I\u2019m a musician first. But I\u2019m beyond humbled this morning to receive two @CriticsChoice nominations. Dec. 12th. #RespectTheBack https://t.co/emfSkHpJvt @ComicBook @RealHughJackman It\u2019s not a competition.
