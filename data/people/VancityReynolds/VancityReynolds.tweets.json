So much. @gtgreg165 @StarrburyMike Nah, I think if you read the tweet without context of the thread, it would be easy to see it as earnest. All good. @StarrburyMike It was a joke. It seems a poorly executed one @derekmross @MMBakner @AviationGin @Mintmobile It\u2019s not like I can just move out of the crawl space underneath the floor of your bedroom. It was hard enough sneaking into the damn place to begin with. @CasuallyRelyt @AviationGin @koolaid I don\u2019t judge. @BeefGazebo Correct. @Oscarfinnmedia I\u2019m sure headlines have a different plan for us all. @tjredone @NickdeSemlyen No need. I watched it for you. Rest. Just... rest. @crc0427 @ZodWriter @GraceRandolph Watching it was not at all what I imagined. I\u2019m normally so hard on myself. But being a decade away from it, made the experience kinda, weirdly, lovely. @NickdeSemlyen If we\u2019re being honest, I started a little tipsy. @maddyeisenberg I do not. But I wear its memory every single day. Happy #StPatricksDay and good luck to the #SnyderCut on @HBOMax! https://t.co/ain5Y4ivPN Maybe it\u2019s the Aviation Gin talking, but #GreenLantern was nothing to fear! Hundreds of incredible crew and cast members did amazing work \u2014 and while it\u2019s not perfect, it ain\u2019t a tragedy. Next time I won\u2019t wait a decade to watch. @AviationGin I honestly don\u2019t know. There\u2019s a lot of heavy hitters in the movie. Not always used in the right way... but still... heavy hitters. Who elevates the movie the most? Wow. Hector just threw his father into a gigantic tornado of fire. That\u2019s exactly how my dad died. E True Hollywood Story should do a \u201cwhere are they now\u201d piece on Hector\u2019s mustache. I genuinely wonder what it\u2019s been up to. The Christian Bale superhero voice. Who wore it first? They spent 6 hrs each day turning Peter Sarsgaard\u2019s head into an over-inflated beach ball. But the GL suit is a onesie made from old Frogger pixels. So creeps @_PropMaster So creeps. We are all Hector. https://t.co/kntSxQxCrN Parrallax thought he was so bad. He had no clue 2020 would make him look like a fucking Beanie Baby. Go back to space, asshole. Goddamn I miss Michael Clarke Duncan. See if you can spot the CGI! https://t.co/aXUXA8kR2i Still have the ring https://t.co/eDezX6iTQc Beware my power. https://t.co/MNMXNDq1Ej https://t.co/UgzacFhCXI They should have sent a poet Do you have any idea how weird it is to act while being attacked by invisible space energy? Finally... a bar! Oath still works. I stand by my oath performance. Honestly, this cast is incredible. Angela Bassett is stunning. Period. Love Stanley Tucci. This was not bad foreshadowing for my life as a dad https://t.co/sj5jzWrWUt Hey @BlakeLively is in this movie!! Oh boy. Tragic childhood flashback sequence killing a beloved parent. Designed to instill a level of depth and hard fought empathy for our hero. Disney perfected this move. I swear I\u2019m drinking to Grammy winner and international ambassador of joy, @TaikaWaititi. Not to numb any pain I might be in. This protagonist seems reckless but likable I only ever read my parts of the script so this is genuinely exciting for me to watch I enjoyed The OA on @Netflix btw @millipeacecraft @AviationGin Yes Starting GL now. First time ever. Too early to ask for a #SnyderCut of this fucker? 3 min. #GinnerAndAMovie @AviationGin https://t.co/vmCqZCdddZ @ZackSnyder Yes! And we\u2019ll watch 300 and Justice League. I promise I\u2019ll raise my hand to ask questions instead of yelling, \u201chow\u2019d you do that?!\u201d Every ten seconds like last time. Make your own Lantern\u2019s Light green cocktail because @drizly delivers. Also get 5 dollars off here: https://t.co/FhlEQ9NGNV It\u2019s apparently the only fucking movie in existence that\u2019s not streaming anywhere so you\u2019re SOL if you want to watch along. But I\u2019m going deep. #GinnerAndAMovie #AviationGin https://t.co/HsHYofDkBg Excited to see the Snyder Cut. But ahead of its debut \u2013 and with the aid of a good amount of #AviationGin - tonight at 6pm EST I\u2019ll do something I\u2019ve never done: actually watch Green Lantern. Happy #StPatricksDay @DanReynolds Papa can you hear meeee? \ud83c\udfb6 Wrong dragons.

They\u2019re from @GarrettLeight @michaela_tim7 It was the best gin I\u2019d ever had before I invested and it continues to be the best gin in the galaxy.
