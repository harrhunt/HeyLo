{"tweets": "Now we need to keep it up. Because until every single American has access to quality, affordable health care, we have more work to do\u2014and I\u2019m grateful to President Biden for continuing to lead the fight. The American Rescue Plan lowers premiums for millions of families, makes health insurance more affordable for low-and middle-income Americans, and provides incentives for states to expand Medicaid and cover as many as four million additional Americans. And now, thanks to the hard work of President Biden, Senator Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, and Americans all across the country who have spent years fighting against repeal and pushing to improve the law, our starter home is starting to look pretty spacious. But I\u2019ve always said that the ACA is like a starter home\u2014it\u2019s our job to keep tinkering with it and improving it over time. The Affordable Care Act has helped 20 million Americans get coverage\u2014and up to 130 million Americans can no longer be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. It has been a lifeline for Americans who've lost their jobs and their health insurance during the pandemic. As part of the American Rescue Plan, @POTUS just signed the largest expansion of health care since the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s an example of how government is supposed to work, and exactly what I hoped would happen when I signed the ACA into law 11 years ago today. https://t.co/G7WUgYdxOp A once-in-a-century pandemic cannot be the only thing that slows mass shootings in this country. It\u2019s time for leaders everywhere to listen to the American people when they say enough is enough. https://t.co/7MEJ87Is3E Join me, @ProtectOurCare, and health care advocates from across the country to discuss 11 years of the Affordable Care Act and the work we still need to do to make sure all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care. Watch now: https://t.co/Rae2yr8EjZ Bruce @Springsteen and I both had complicated relationships with our fathers. In our latest conversation on Renegades: Born in the USA, we discuss our upbringing, masculinity, and the role our fathers played in helping us become the men we are today. https://t.co/FNriJIUw3r https://t.co/tqGXS6SzMj 11 years after the Affordable Care Act was passed, it\u2019s getting even better. I\u2019ll be having a conversation with @ProtectOurCare this Monday, March 22 at 1:15 PM ET and hope you\u2019ll join:\u00a0https://t.co/SpbyOP81Ky .@POTUS set a goal to deliver 100 million vaccine shots in 100 days. His administration hit the milestone in just 58. Let\u2019s keep it going: Please get the vaccine as soon as it\u2019s available to you. It\u2019s the only way to beat this pandemic. https://t.co/uYmwRMMmYw Like many of you, I\u2019m thrilled that #MarchMadness is finally back. You can check out my picks here: https://t.co/S5mlQofvAp https://t.co/xyePa9ux2y Michelle and I pray for the victims, their families, everyone grieving these needless and devastating killings\u2014and we urge meaningful action that will save lives. Yesterday's shootings are another tragic reminder that we have far more work to do to put in place commonsense gun safety laws and root out the pervasive patterns of hatred and violence in our society. Even as we\u2019ve battled the pandemic, we\u2019ve continued to neglect the longer-lasting epidemic of gun violence in America. Although the shooter\u2019s motive is not yet clear, the identity of the victims underscores an alarming rise in anti-Asian violence that must end. Congrats to directors @NicoleNewnham, @JimLeBrecht, and everyone with @CripCampFilm on the Oscar nomination! The heart, passion, and brilliance of those who led the disability rights movement is something to celebrate. Michelle and I hope you'll watch their story on Netflix. I could not be prouder of the @ChiPubSchools students I spoke with recently about A Promised Land. One of the reasons I wrote this book was for young people to be able to see themselves in my story\u2014and I hope our conversation left them as inspired as it left me. https://t.co/Aov53IvX6l For the latest episode of our podcast, I talk to Bruce @Springsteen about my time as a community organizer and the influences that led to me pursuing a career in public service. Take a listen on Spotify: https://t.co/pxARdCUpFO https://t.co/l67AZEFuC5 When @POTUS was elected, he said help was on the way\u2014and he delivered. The American Rescue Plan is landmark legislation that will ring through generations, lifting up families and beating back this pandemic.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHere's how it will help people like you:\u00a0https://t.co/EabnMBoXhy Michelle and I got vaccinated against COVID-19 because we know it\u2019s the best way to beat this pandemic, protect one another, and get the country back up and running again. So I hope you\u2019ll get the vaccine as soon as it\u2019s available to you. It could save your life. https://t.co/OJLwZbv0iz From my first cross-country road trip as a child to Bruce\u2019s experience coming of age toward the end of the Vietnam War, @Springsteen and I each continue to reflect on moments from our upbringing that helped shape our view of America. Listen here: https://t.co/3vQxU2zQub https://t.co/BPwubQuBcv Fifty-six years after Bloody Sunday, our march is not yet over. There are more steps to be taken, more bridges to be crossed. And that\u2019s why the Obama Presidential Center is designed to honor the giants who carried us and inspire the next generation to lead us forward. https://t.co/0ac3aWgCY0 This is the kind of progress that\u2019s possible when we elect leaders across government who are devoted to making people\u2019s lives better\u2014and a reminder of why it\u2019s so important to vote. This landmark legislation will help families pay rent and put food on the table, lift millions of children out of poverty, make health care more affordable, aid small businesses, fund broad-based vaccination efforts, and make it easier for states to reopen schools. Elections matter\u2014and we\u2019re seeing why. Congratulations to the Biden Administration and to the American people on a COVID relief bill that will improve the lives of families across the country. .@BillGates' new book is an exceptionally clear and accessible primer on climate change. He's unblinking in the difficulty of meeting this challenge but maintains a cautious optimism that it can be met\u2014and provides a framework for action that is both specific and workable. https://t.co/Ukms2M9iK5 And as we rightly celebrate what Democrats accomplished in the 2020 election, it\u2019s always worth analyzing those successes in depth\u2014and looking at where we came up short\u2014as we look toward future cycles. This interview includes some ideas worth considering: https://t.co/c75VpLwkgD The Biden administration\u2019s commitment to democratic values at home and abroad couldn\u2019t be more important\u2014because democracy remains at risk around the world: https://t.co/hjDcY6ZtOv If you haven\u2019t read Michelle\u2019s memoir yet, I hope you do\u2014especially if the young readers\u2019 edition might resonate with you or someone you know. Becoming isn\u2019t just a title\u2014it\u2019s a process we all go through, and Miche\u2019s story brings that to life with real honesty and beauty. https://t.co/bO8Y0Kkelz Like so many others, Michelle and I benefited from Vernon Jordan's wise counsel and warm friendship\u2014and deeply admired his tireless fight for civil rights. We hope the memory of his extraordinary presence and the legacy of his work bring comfort to Ann, Vickee, and his family. https://t.co/HBZfGUuyVl RT @springsteen: In Episode 3 of Renegades: Born in the USA, Bruce and @BarackObama talk about identity, grace, and some of the songs that\u2026 Music has always been an important part of my life, and I think it\u2019s safe to say that the same is true for @Springsteen. In this episode, we talked about the songs that\u2019ve made a difference for us\u2014and Bruce even brought out the guitar. Listen on @Spotify:\u00a0https://t.co/pUlY5kGQnZ https://t.co/vhMRZMgpnE To date, My Brother\u2019s Keeper has touched thousands of lives, and these are just a few stories of the inspiring young men we\u2019ve met. By joining the @MBK_Alliance, you can help us reach even more. https://t.co/ol1G5LLZ8n Today marks seven years since we launched My Brother\u2019s Keeper to reduce barriers and expand opportunity for boys and young men of color. And it remains true that the only way our country lives up to its ideals is if our young people can reach their fullest potential. https://t.co/dOoOGPxnNv I first picked up Toni Morrison\u2019s novels when I was entering college, and her voice fundamentally changed my perspective on the world. This Black History Month, I reflected on the impact that her writing has had on my life. https://t.co/zSLkfkHmET https://t.co/W6Yn1YYaSF It was\u00a0great\u00a0to hear from this impressive group\u00a0of young leaders. If there's\u00a0one thing we\u00a0can\u00a0bank\u00a0on, it\u2019s that young folks like\u00a0these\u00a0are our best hope for\u00a0a more sustainable and just world. https://t.co/r3hzsgwgg3 In each of us, there's a story to be shared\u2014a story that\u2019s sacred and can bring us together. I had such a good time talking with the @WellReadBlkGirl Book Club about A Promised Land because just as they learned about my story, I had a chance to learn from theirs. https://t.co/u6vAXUSK5s Even as we focus on fighting COVID-19, it\u2019s important to recognize that there\u2019s another pandemic raging right now\u2014one that\u2019s decades in the making and unique to the United States. We need to treat gun violence with the same urgency and resolve. https://t.co/3nD7uc194V Sending my prayers to @TigerWoods and his family tonight\u2014here\u2019s to a speedy recovery for the GOAT of golf. If we\u2019ve learned anything over the years, it\u2019s to never count Tiger out. Last year, I sat down with my good friend Bruce @Springsteen for a long and meaningful conversation that touched on so much of what we\u2019re all dealing with these days. I\u2019m excited to share it with you over the next few weeks: https://t.co/sQACD08AWx https://t.co/biMoxCLhAG For decades, John Lewis not only gave all of himself to the cause of freedom and justice, but inspired generations that followed to try to live up to his example. On his birthday, we honor his memory, and work toward continuing his legacy by creating change in our communities. I want to share this inspiring book about the events leading up to the 1960 election, from Dr. King's imprisonment to student activism in Atlanta to JFK's campaign. It's a story we can all learn from\u2014a story of overlooked heroes and the power each of us has to create change. https://t.co/yIaNJpRq7M Congrats to @NASAJPL on landing @MarsPersevere today! Looking forward to seeing what this mission uncovers\u2014and proud our administration invested in this effort eight years ago to help continue America\u2019s rich tradition of exploration and discovery. I felt inspired and hopeful after speaking with students in @TheTellingRoom\u2019s Young Writers &amp; Leaders program. I wrote #APromisedLand in part because I hoped to reach young people like those in this group\u2014the unique voices of a new generation, energized and unafraid to dream big. https://t.co/LP1Ri8Epva Michelle and I are thinking of everyone across the country braving the winter storms this week. Here\u2019s an overview of how you can help\u2014or, if you\u2019re in Texas, where you can go to stay warm or get support.\u00a0https://t.co/zDnLrjOZ5i Great news: Thanks to President Biden, starting today, you can go to https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod to sign up for health insurance.

Your dazzling light makes everything brighter. https://t.co/fMcdwf2j20 During our time in the White House, Michelle and I were proud to display artwork from artists like Alma Thomas and Charles Alston\u2014whose work provoked thought, challenged our assumptions, and shaped how we define our narrative as a country. https://t.co/eDd76kmlc1 There is a lot of disinformation out there, but here\u2019s the truth: You should get a COVID vaccine as soon as it's available to you. It could save your life\u2014or a loved one\u2019s.\nhttps://t.co/jfRr8es6gW Climate\u00a0change\u00a0is a real threat to us all\u2014but feeling helpless or overwhelmed isn\u2019t going to solve it.

Our hope is that the center will breathe new life into historic Jackson Park while delivering jobs, growth, and much more to the South Side.\n\nLet\u2019s get to work. https://t.co/cOqoPmaLkf Black-owned independent bookstores play a critical role in communities all across our country. I wanted to show my support, so I dropped in to surprise the folks from @MahoganyBooks &amp; the Very Smart Brothas Book Club. Take a look. https://t.co/sQdc8xY6xY When Jackie Robinson faced down slurs, spiked cleats, and pitches aimed at his head\u2014and stole home anyway\u2014he didn't only change baseball.

For me, the title of my book is about the work we need to do to realize the promise of becoming a more perfect union, even if we don\u2019t get there in our lifetimes. Glad to see your book club is reading it! https://t.co/aVRMxwt5JH https://t.co/Uz3LMAWD2z Here\u2019s an example of the incredible risks and burdens that our essential workers have been facing. And even as we move toward vaccinating our population, we all need to remain vigilant until we\u2019ve beaten this pandemic.\nhttps://t.co/SKhioxW0Mp Hank Aaron was one of the best baseball players we\u2019ve ever seen and one of the strongest people I\u2019ve ever met. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to the Aaron family and everyone who was inspired by this unassuming man and his towering example. https://t.co/2RZdc82Y18 This is a time for boldness and President Biden is already delivering.\n\nBy rejoining the Paris climate accords on day one, he declared loudly and clearly that the U.S. will once again lead the fight against climate change.\n\nAnd this is only the beginning. \nhttps://t.co/6cSS49lkyx Today was a good day.\n\nAnd it was only possible because of you. Because you made calls. Because you marched. Because you wore your masks and voted like never before.\n\nFor four years, you defended our democracy with everything you had\u2014and now, our country can enter a new day. https://t.co/JicHOQCIxt On a day for the history books, @TheAmandaGorman delivered a poem that more than met the moment.

Here are some ways you can get involved in your community: https://t.co/r9IGEW5dpD If anyone had a right to question whether our democracy was worth redeeming, it was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Because in the face of billy clubs and lynchings, poll taxes and literacy tests, he never gave in to violence, never waved a traitorous flag or gave up on our country. https://t.co/TCmbuiXkUa Happy birthday to my love, my partner, and my best friend.

We\u2019re seeing how far some will go to retain power and threaten the fundamental principles of our democracy. But our democracy isn\u2019t about any individual, even a president\u2014it\u2019s about you. Georgia, you voted in record numbers to send @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris to the White House.\n\nNow we need you to show up again to vote @ReverendWarnock and Jon @Ossoff to the U.S. Senate.

From my family to yours, Merry Christmas! https://t.co/rhKouyDrI9 It\u2019s unconscionable that there are families worried over the holidays that they\u2019ll be evicted next month. Extending the eviction moratorium was a start, but Congress has to do more to help folks who can\u2019t pay rent because of COVID-related unemployment. https://t.co/mW5HO9sNhc With COVID cases surging worse than ever, getting vaccinated is one of the most important things we can do. But until the vaccine is widely available, socially distancing and wearing masks will actually save even more lives, and alleviate the pressure on healthcare workers.

I hope you enjoy reading these as much as I did. https://t.co/UHk4RA9dow I had some fun answering questions about #APromisedLand for BookTube.

Most of all, I hope it inspires you to see yourself playing a role in shaping a better world. https://t.co/hdZysCpCN9 Music has always played an important role in my life\u2014and that was especially true during my presidency. In honor of my book hitting shelves tomorrow, I put together this playlist featuring some memorable songs from my administration.

And if all this takes eliminating the filibuster\u2014a Jim Crow relic\u2013\u2013then that\u2019s what we should do. We can do this by making sure every American is automatically registered to vote, including formerly incarcerated people. Let\u2019s also make sure to add more polling places, expand early voting, and make Election Day a national holiday. We've got to fight harder to protect the right to vote. It\u2019s one of the most powerful tools we have\u2013\u2013and we can start by passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Once we pass that, we should continue marching forward to make it even better. Today is the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act\u2013\u2013one of the crowning achievements of our democracy. But once the Supreme Court weakened it, some state legislatures unleashed a flood of laws designed specifically to make voting harder, especially in communities of color. I\u2019m proud to endorse this diverse and hopeful collection of thoughtful, empathetic, and highly qualified Democrats. If you\u2019re in one of their districts or states, make sure you vote for them this fall.

Here\u2019s my advice for the Class of 2020: https://t.co/XD2n7LEihk We\u2019ve seen the power that our voices have when we speak out about injustice\u2013\u2013but we also know the toll that it takes on our mental health. Today, I talked to @repjohnlewis, Bryan Stevenson, and @MBK_Alliance activists about ways to keep our mental health a priority at this time. https://t.co/PAsWb607EU On National Gun Violence Awareness Day, we #WearOrange to honor the victims and survivors of gun violence\u2013\u2013which continues to disproportionately harm Black communities. Then keep speaking up, voting, and changing laws across the country. Third, every city in this country should be a @MBK_Alliance community. We have 250 cities, counties, and tribal nations working to reduce barriers and expand opportunity for boys and young men of color. Join us: https://t.co/RZRwimA3SO Second, every mayor should review their use of force policies with members of their community and commit to report on planned reforms. We need mayors, county executives, and those in positions of power to make this a priority. Take the pledge: https://t.co/c8pAlhJsPJ First, there are specific evidence-based reforms that would build trust, save lives, and lead to a decrease in crime, too. You can find clear, actionable recommendations right here: https://t.co/V7b0mJoZiL Real change requires protest to highlight a problem, and politics to implement practical solutions and laws. As I mentioned yesterday in our @MBK_Alliance town hall, there are several steps our mayors and elected officials can take right now: In our @MBK_Alliance town hall yesterday, I mentioned James Baldwin's The Fire Next Time. From 1962, it remains a seminal meditation on race by one of our greatest writers and relevant for understanding the pain and anger behind the protests. Excerpt: https://t.co/50F9ZP3JhQ And third, an extraordinary essay by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces, Mike Mullen, explaining the values at risk when we start using our military to control domestic protests.\n\nhttps://t.co/ftmm5crbgg Second, a reminder of the difference politics and voting can make in changing who has the power to make real change in a community like Ferguson with a history of blatant discriminatory law enforcement practices.\n\nhttps://t.co/U0z9wMOx8z Here\u2019s a useful read\u2013\u2013a reminder of the importance of de-escalation by police in their interactions with protestors.\n\nhttps://t.co/Ondw85gQNL \"Let\u2019s do this another way. Let's stop thinking our voice don\u2019t matter and vote. Not just for the president...educate yourself and know who you\u2019re voting for. And that\u2019s how we're going to hit 'em.\" https://t.co/WX6oLNRtI2 Let\u2019s get to work. https://t.co/jEczrOeFdv I know the past few months have been hard and dispiriting. But watching the heightened activism of young people makes me hopeful. And if we can keep channeling our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, this can be the moment when real change starts. If you want to take concrete action, but you\u2019re not sure how, we\u2019ve created a site to connect you with useful resources and organizations who\u2019ve been fighting the good fight at the local and national levels for years. https://t.co/2KcB4T3b0I 5. The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away. 4. So if we want to bring about real change, the choice isn\u2019t between protest and politics\u2013\u2013we have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform. 3. To do that, we have to know which levels of government have the biggest impact. Changing the federal government is important. But the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels. 2. The point of protest is to raise public awareness, to put a spotlight on injustice, and to make the powers that be uncomfortable. But eventually, we have to translate those aspirations into specific laws and institutional practices. 1. The protests represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system. We should condemn the few who resort to violence\u2013\u2013not the overwhelming majority who deserve our respect and support. Ultimately, it\u2019s going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times. But I want to highlight some basic lessons from past efforts that are worth remembering: As millions of people across the country take to the streets and raise their voices in response to the killing of George Floyd and the ongoing problem of unequal justice, I\u2019ve heard many ask how we can sustain momentum to bring about real change. I wrote out some thoughts on how to make this moment a real turning point to bring about real change\u2013\u2013and pulled together some resources to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action. https://t.co/jEczrOeFdv My statement on the death of George Floyd: https://t.co/Hg1k9JHT6R If you believe in a more just, more generous, more democratic America, now is the time to fight for it. Here\u2019s a terrific way to register voters, organize communities, and ramp up turnout in the battleground states that will decide this election: https://t.co/FmN8RCJymg https://t.co/R5FZ6OBfxz On Memorial Day, we honor those who gave all for us.

Even if we can\u2019t get together in person this year, Michelle and I are excited to celebrate the nationwide Class of 2020 and recognize this milestone with you and your loved ones. https://t.co/ngR2ykx3A2 The folks of the Chicago @fooddepository\u2014and food banks in communities like yours\u2014are working overtime to feed the vulnerable and families who\u2019ve fallen on hard times. But even as demand has spiked, donations have slowed. Their incredible efforts are worth supporting if you can. https://t.co/kSdijlyHLH The pandemic has magnified the financial insecurity of too many American families, the deep and real racial disparities in our society \u2013 and the imbalanced burdens on working moms. We have to create something better for America on the other side of this. https://t.co/eyy3dC22Ze In moments of crisis, we look out for one other. And we need leaders with empathy who will bring people together rather than drive them apart. @JoeBiden has the character and experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery. https://t.co/JkaBWYejKh This pandemic has painfully brought to the surface many of the reasons I launched @MBK_Alliance\u2014structural racism robs too many of our kids of their futures. The leaders on today's call aren't just tackling this crisis; they\u2019re helping us build a more equitable future for all. https://t.co/9dsedZYt0E If we want life to approach anything like normal anytime soon, we need a comprehensive testing program. It\u2019s not going to be cheap, but it will ultimately pay off many times over in saved lives, saved businesses, and saved jobs. https://t.co/pnN9KVcvQR While we continue to wait for a coherent national plan to navigate this pandemic, states like Massachusetts are beginning to adopt their own public health plans to combat this virus\u2013\u2013before it's too late. https://t.co/Eb2Hz8H8vU We've all had to adapt to cope with a pandemic. Climate change will force far harsher changes on our kids. All of us should follow the young people who've led the efforts to protect our planet for generations, and demand more of our leaders at every level. https://t.co/uNueQl5bNX Parents, you deserve a break \u2013 Michelle\u2019s got storytime handled every Monday. She\u2019s one of the best, I promise. (And I confess it makes me a little nostalgic.) https://t.co/Pmz8kRNMBC Proud of the leaders in my hometown of Chicago who are showing us what it means to be there for each other\u2013\u2013as neighbors and as citizens. https://t.co/DjnC1F9ph7 When I think of people I\u2019ve counted on over the years, Sarah Hurwitz comes to mind. She's the talented author of @HereAllAlong, and a longtime member of my team. Here she shares her experience with faith, traditions, and staying connected during this time. https://t.co/pftk4JkhKQ Democracy depends on an informed citizenry and social cohesion. Here\u2019s a look at how misinformation can spread through social media, and why it can hurt our ability to respond to crises. https://t.co/qnLcR3mh8A For all of us who love this country and are willing to do our part to make sure it lives up to its highest ideals \u2013 now\u2019s the time to fight for what we believe in. Join us at https://t.co/Kboaxi3MVL. And I\u2019ll see you on the campaign trail as soon as I can. I\u2019m proud to endorse my friend @JoeBiden for President of the United States. Let's go: https://t.co/maHVGRozkX Dreamers have contributed so much to our country, and they are risking their lives fighting on the frontlines of this pandemic. They deserve permanent immigration status and a pathway to citizenship\u2014as they are Americans in every way but on paper. https://t.co/e4IYqX3WIy We can't deny that racial and socioeconomic factors are playing a role in who is being hit the hardest by the virus. It's a reminder for our policymakers to keep our most vulnerable communities at the forefront when making decisions.\nhttps://t.co/aipc8p7Hwh Although our celebrations may look different this year, our unwavering faith remains the same. For me, Easter is a time of hope\u2013\u2013a reminder of rebirth and renewal\u2013\u2013and a belief in a better day to come. From my family to yours, we wish you all a blessed and joyful Easter. https://t.co/xEsgxOarQ5 Let\u2019s not use the tragedy of a pandemic to compromise our democracy. Check the facts of vote by mail. https://t.co/aTNxRV4Ws3 Everyone should have the right to vote safely, and we have the power to make that happen. This shouldn't be a partisan issue. https://t.co/gL38DpYEmu No one should be forced to choose between their right to vote and their right to stay healthy like the debacle in Wisconsin this week. https://t.co/fbDCbOb9qN Some good news: states that started social distancing early and aggressively, like California, have avoided overwhelmed health care systems. It\u2019s critical that we continue to listen to the evidence and experts and practice social distancing. https://t.co/56RgGeAfr7 Mayors have been working hard to help us get through this pandemic, and they\u2019ll have just as big a task to help people through hard times ahead. I spent some time with many of them today to thank them for their efforts, and asked them to keep up the good work. https://t.co/YzqPMPo8m2 Through centuries of persecution, exile and struggle, the story of Passover has reminded the Jewish people\u2013\u2013and all of humanity\u2013\u2013of the power to overcome even the greatest of odds. Michelle and I send our warmest wishes to those celebrating with loved ones at home or virtually. Social distancing bends the curve and relieves some pressure on our heroic medical professionals. But in order to shift off current policies, the key will be a robust system of testing and monitoring \u2013 something we have yet to put in place nationwide. https://t.co/evkTSrzReB My advisor and friend @cecmunoz has been someone I\u2019ve turned to for years. In her new book, More Than Ready, she shares her story and an empowering message to women, especially women of color, that they are the leaders we need to make a change in our world. https://t.co/6bQski6N23 It\u2019s World Health Day, and we owe a profound debt of gratitude to all our medical professionals. They\u2019re still giving their all for us every day, at great risk to themselves, and we can\u2019t thank them enough for their bravery and their service. Bill Withers was a true American master. His music, rooted in the everyday joys and sorrows of working people, was soulful, wise and life-affirming\u2013\u2013a perfect tonic for hard times. https://t.co/P8cusIny4k As she often does, @SenWarren provides a cogent summary of how federal policymakers should be thinking about the pandemic in the coming months. https://t.co/zkX0E7ncK5 It's Census Day and we all have a crucial role to play. Filling out the 2020 Census determines what the next decade will look like for your community: your roads, health care, schools, representation and more. Takes a few minutes by mail, phone or online. https://t.co/KzxFJKavmM We've seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic. We can't afford any more consequences of climate denial. All of us, especially young people, have to demand better of our government at every level and vote this fall. https://t.co/K8Ucu7iVDK So many Americans right now are stepping up to help their communities. Zohaib Begg, a 7-year-old from VA, is one of them. This inspiring kid has been gathering supplies from hotels to donate to the medical professionals at his local hospital. https://t.co/K8Pvp9Cyaq We are grateful for what he did for this country. He carried the baton longer and surer than almost anybody. It falls to the rest of us now to pick it up and never stop moving forward until we finish what he started\u2014that journey to justice. What a joy it was to watch him pray and preach. I took heart in him saying, \u201cWe ain\u2019t going back. We\u2019ve come too far, marched too long, prayed too hard, wept too bitterly, bled too profusely, and died too young to let anybody turn back the clock on our journey to justice.\u201d Rev. Joseph Lowery was a giant who let so many of us stand on his shoulders. With boundless generosity, patience, and moral courage, he encouraged a new generation of activists and leaders. Michelle and I remember him fondly today, and our love and prayers are with his family. https://t.co/xxjY2habOm During this crisis, our grocery store clerks, delivery drivers, transit and utility workers\u2014along with so many others\u2014have been selflessly getting up every day to make sure we have the things we need. And for that, we say thank you.\nhttps://t.co/Fq5qIRXt03 And this article provides a great example of the kind of community spirit that we need to get through this\u2014a spirit that we can hopefully learn to instill more of into our lives, workplaces, civic institutions, and government once the crisis has passed. https://t.co/xYZvspW4Ug Here\u2019s a useful overview of the likely scenarios that the world will be facing in the coming months while managing this pandemic. So much depends on our ability to make good decisions going forward along with our ability to remain resilient. https://t.co/uYpP1KfOUs These are the burdens our medical heroes already face in NYC. It's only going to get harder across the country. Another reason to maintain social distancing policies at least until we have comprehensive testing in place. Not just for our sake\u2014for theirs. https://t.co/bwNXhOPMYs Our medical professionals are heroes putting their lives on the line to keep our country going. Here's a look at how an ER doctor who already fought on the front lines of one crisis makes it through a day in this one. A good reminder for us to help them out by staying home. https://t.co/ah7vva9776 Here\u2019s a useful summary of the current best thinking among public health experts on how we need to approach the fight against COVID-19 in the coming weeks. https://t.co/7cy71sKLVG Ten years ago today, I signed the Affordable Care Act into law. It protected preexisting conditions, cut the uninsured rate in half, and lots more. But it's still under political attack right when we need care the most. We have to protect it, build on it, until we cover everyone. https://t.co/zz2v3DzMgq Sometimes it takes the wisdom and resilience of those who have been marginalized for all of us to remember the importance of community and mutual aid. And @cripchick, a disabled activist, understands what it\u2019s like for people with particular vulnerabilities to come together for support:\nhttps://t.co/aBAuBoMYFm .@sullydish witnessed the impact of HIV-AIDS on the LGBT community in the early stages of that devastating disease: https://t.co/j0ipIrzoDC Here are a few stories that have less to do with the very real medical or economic aspects of this crisis, and more with how we take care of each other as a human family during all crises: The best part of my job was meeting people like this\u2014ready to make a selfless act in a time of need. Many Americans are already making deep sacrifices to keep our communities healthy, but if you\u2019re able to, consider helping those hit the hardest. https://t.co/CdrMsC6VXF .@rgay and @SheaSerrano are using their feeds to directly support people in need\u2014and helping shift our ideas about how to approach giving.\nhttps://t.co/1JHPUYEiKV In my old neighborhood, the @BSAllianceChi established a crisis pantry to provide food and essential items for particularly vulnerable queer and trans residents on the South and West sides of Chicago.\nhttps://t.co/ilyDlj3ago .@ObamaFoundation Fellow @alexsmith1982 is helping seniors fight loneliness in the UK through a mix of new and old technology: online chats through Zoom and Skype, and postcards and poems shared by younger neighbors.\nhttps://t.co/GdnqDR8JJ4 Some great stories of big-hearted people coming up with new ways to come together\u2014even while remaining apart\u2014to help the vulnerable who face some very tough times ahead.\nhttps://t.co/kcBQK915jo In the meantime, remember to check up by phone on elderly or vulnerable friends and neighbors who may need our help. As communities have begun to recognize the importance of social distancing measures to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d on COVID-19 transmission, here\u2019s a sober but useful primer on what we should expect in the coming months: https://t.co/9oqdRF5J0Q We owe a profound debt of gratitude to all our health professionals and everybody who\u2019ll be on the front lines of this pandemic for a long while. They\u2019re giving everything. May we all model our own behavior on their selflessness and sacrifice as we help each other through this. https://t.co/F3tsJTqd4c Not everybody can stay home, and we owe a big debt of gratitude to health professionals, transit and airport workers, first responders, and everyone keeping our communities going. Leaders have to step up to support people whose lives and livelihoods take a hit in the weeks ahead. Watch this. It shows why we should all do the right thing and stay home to the fullest extent possible. All of us can help slow the spread of the virus, protecting the elderly, the vulnerable, and each other. https://t.co/FgffQrMVB7 A shout out to Kevin, Giannis, Zion, Blake, Steph and all the players, owners and organizations who are setting a good example during a challenging time. A reminder that we\u2019re a community, and that each of us has an obligation to look out for each other. https://t.co/cv1RZi9GGL If you\u2019re wondering whether it\u2019s an overreaction to cancel large gatherings and public events (and I love basketball), here\u2019s a useful primer as to why these measures can slow the spread of the virus and save lives. We have to look out for each other. https://t.co/Ld7Uc8sPTQ In the midst of campaign season, it\u2019s important to look squarely at what\u2019s at stake. This article speaks to one of the disturbing long term trends that we as voters and citizens need to expect our government to address. https://t.co/m49rbES0i6 RT @repjohnlewis: 55 years ago today, we were beaten, tear gassed, and trampled by horses. I thought I saw death. I thought I was going to\u2026 55 years ago, when a group of civil rights organizers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they carried America with them.

Save the masks for health care workers. Let\u2019s stay calm, listen to the experts, and follow the science. Michelle and I are sending our prayers to those affected by the severe storms in Tennessee, especially to those who lost loved ones. Our hearts are with you and the first responders working so diligently to protect the vibrant communities of Nashville. America needs you as states prepare for the next round of redistricting. It's up to all of us to make sure we have a fair democracy. Join me in the fight for fair maps.\n  \nJoin me and @allontheline today: https://t.co/bTF7myfK5s Shirley Chisholm said \"You don't make progress by standing on the sidelines, whimpering and complaining.

Thanks for making good trouble for 80 years, @repjohnlewis. https://t.co/LqMuvmpbLp https://t.co/AQJsfBf0ri Here are a couple of articles that are worth reading \u2014 from housing to health, these stories use data to explore challenges we face and demonstrate how policy solutions along with civic engagement can make a real difference in people\u2019s lives.\nhttps://t.co/G6EIUwuMqV Eleven years ago today, near the bottom of the worst recession in generations, I signed the Recovery Act, paving the way for more than a decade of economic growth and the longest streak of job creation in American history. https://t.co/BmdXrxUAUf RT @ObamaFoundation: It\u2019s a big day in Chicago as @NBAAllStar returns to our city for the first time since 1988.

The antidote is citizenship: to get engaged, organized, mobilized, and to vote - on every level, in every election. https://t.co/yOvaCZYtrW Thirty years on, I remember the hope we all felt watching Mandela\u2019s release from prison. The gift of a new way of seeing. The chance to participate in the work of building a better world. The ultimate example of perseverance and faith for each new generation to follow. Congrats to Julia and Steven, the filmmakers behind American Factory, for telling such a complex, moving story about the very human consequences of wrenching economic change. Glad to see two talented and downright good people take home the Oscar for Higher Ground\u2019s first release. https://t.co/W4AZ68iWoY Sixty years ago today, the Greensboro Four stood up to injustice by sitting down at a lunch counter. Our journey is full of such stories; of acts of patriotic protest that challenge this country we love to live up to our highest ideals, however long it takes. #BlackHistoryMonth Kobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act. To lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day. Every so often, I re-read Dr. King\u2019s Letter from a Birmingham Jail. While some of the injustices may have changed, his poetic brilliance, moral clarity, and tests of conscience still reverberate today. Take a moment to reflect on his righteous call: https://t.co/oBdqFqdWA6 In every scene, you are my star, @MichelleObama! Happy birthday, baby! https://t.co/hgMBhHasBj Glad to see American Factory\u2019s Oscar nod for Best Documentary. It\u2019s the kind of story we don\u2019t see often enough and it\u2019s exactly what Michelle and I hope to achieve with Higher Ground. Congrats to the incredible filmmakers and entire team! Our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico can use our support after this week\u2019s earthquakes. They\u2019ve shown their enduring spirit over the past couple years, and it\u2019s up to us to pull together for one another once again. I hope you\u2019ll support their recovery: https://t.co/rYhSb8uVXK Here\u2019s the thing: Even with problems of this magnitude, each of us can still find a way to make change. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud of young people like Alice Mahar, a environmental activist in Melbourne. Read about her and find ways you can help, too: https://t.co/qAHFiBgw6b The catastrophic fires in Australia are the latest example of the very real and very urgent consequences of climate change.

I\u2019m excited to share that in December, I\u2019ll be visiting Vietnam to meet some of the inspiring girls\u2026 Congrats to the @WashMystics on a gutsy, first-ever championship! A great team performance when it counted. If folks aren\u2019t careful, this title thing might become a habit in DC. Here\u2019s an interesting read\u2014a reminder that behind every opinion lies a human being with real experiences and a story to tell. Sometimes we\u2019ll agree and sometimes we won\u2019t, but if we want our democracy work, listening to each other isn\u2019t optional. https://t.co/8d4fPUprlu As President, I leaned on @AmbassadorRice\u2019s experience, expertise, and willingness to tell me what I needed to hear. In her memoir, Tough Love, you\u2019ll see why. It\u2019s a tribute to American leadership\u2014and a unifying call for us to do our part to protect it. I hope you\u2019ll read it. https://t.co/7iUWt76xUw Like the Beatles said: It\u2019s getting better all the time. Thanks, babe, for 27 amazing years! https://t.co/mImRqIYn1R On National Voter Registration Day, it\u2019s up to us as citizens to make sure everyone we know can make their voices heard at the ballot box. Check and update your registration at https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX \u2014 and tell your friends, too. One challenge will define the future for today\u2019s young generation more dramatically than any other: Climate change. The millions of young people worldwide who\u2019ve organized and joined today\u2019s #ClimateStrike demand action to protect our planet, and they deserve it. Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet\u2019s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she\u2019s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her. https://t.co/VgCPAaDp3C That\u2019s what Americans do when others are in need \u2013 we help. We give. We inspire. Want to make a difference? There are a number of ways you can help right here: https://t.co/cnRcAfNIk2 Jermaine Bell is just six years old, but when he saw people in need, he took the money he\u2019d been saving for a trip to Disney World and spent it on food and water for South Carolina evacuees.\nhttps://t.co/H6xBIW4Ka0 Bahamian families and communities face a long recovery from Hurricane Dorian. And Americans are reaching out to help. Brittany Garvin is helping people reunite and evacuate. https://t.co/k5hXu68RPH As we remember those we lost on 9/11, we also remember the spirit of unity and togetherness that defined the weeks and months after. On this day of service, I\u2019m reflecting on all those still working to embrace that spirit, today and every day. https://t.co/y8x9PVcwDl Marca had a remarkable way of bringing out the best within us. For me, she was a trusted voice and a persistent, buoyant spirit\u2014an example that progress can be slow, but it\u2019s always possible. We\u2019ll miss her, but we\u2019re far better off because of her fight. https://t.co/gVkQvENtIs Yesterday\u2019s ruling is a big win for North Carolina\u2014and for all of us. Voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around. This win is proof that change is always within our reach, on gerrymandering, voting rights, and much more. https://t.co/sVlKm1JaIt Saw this story of a young person doing great work and wanted to share it\u2014keep it up, David! That\u2019s some creative organizing.\nhttps://t.co/bbkbf7vygr Training is at the heart of organizing. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve always made it a priority \u2013 from my 2008 campaign until now. And it\u2019s why I\u2019m proud to announce @allontheline\u2019s in-person training initiative, Redistricting U.

Hope you enjoy. https://t.co/BS5ri1lvxz A good story gives you the chance to better understand someone else\u2019s life. It can help you find common ground. And it\u2019s why Michelle and I were drawn to Higher Ground\u2019s first film, American Factory. Take a look at our conversation with the directors, and check it out on Netflix. https://t.co/KzkYFqjrFV Toni Morrison was a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. Her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination. What a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while. https://t.co/JG7Jgu4p9t Until all of us stand up and insist on holding public officials accountable for changing our gun laws, these tragedies will keep happening: https://t.co/reTnmcg3xo https://t.co/nNOVtQ50O4 The families of our wounded warriors don't often get a lot of fanfare, but they're serving and sacrificing right alongside their loved ones. We all owe a debt to them, too, and Fisher House is always making sure we're serving those who serve us. https://t.co/dqnvNk9cQR Recent court decisions make it clear that the change we need to restore our democracy has to come from the ground up. @Allontheline\u2019s work to ensure an accurate census count and achieve fair maps in 2021 has never been more important.

But more than what we did, I\u2019m proud of how they\u2019re continuing to fight for an America that\u2019s better. https://t.co/0cfDltjueP RT @ObamaFoundation: Leaders: Africa may have ended, but 200 inspiring #ObamaLeaders returned to their homes with the new connections and f\u2026 Economist Raj Chetty is not only identifying the decline in opportunity we\u2019ve seen in recent decades\u2014but trying to reverse it. Inequality, like many problems we face, is as vast as it is complex. But this article left me a little more hopeful: https://t.co/CcsXpVVfkP Here are a couple of articles backed by new research that are worth taking a look at: A new study on the Medicaid expansion my administration fought for under the Affordable Care Act\u2014and how these policy decisions affect lives in real terms: https://t.co/Lj4g7lGFnq In America, we don\u2019t fear the future, we embrace it. 50 years ago, that spirit took us to the moon. Today, it\u2019s embodied by people like Tiffany Davis. She\u2019s a young rocket scientist who is helping us explore the next frontier, wherever that might take us. https://t.co/a573n8hqtG RT @MichelleObama: What truly makes our country great is its diversity.

Thanks for letting me spend yesterday afternoon with you\u2014you\u2019re going to go on to do incredible things and make many people proud.

A great performance from a great team\u2014looking forward to Sunday. #OneNationOneTeam No one changes the world alone.

Read my reflection on our second year: https://t.co/ly3en2Neu4 The most important job in our democracy is citizen.

On Juneteenth, we celebrate the anniversary of that news - freedom - reaching slaves in Texas. And something more: https://t.co/kSkLHbfnc3 This is worth a read: a thought-provoking reminder that education reform isn\u2019t a cure-all. As a supporter of education reform, I agree that fixing educational inequality requires doing more to address the broader, systemic sources of economic inequality. https://t.co/96B7fkBM4u Yes we can, Greta. I\u2019m hopeful because of you and all the young people who are fighting to protect the planet. Keep at it. https://t.co/sUBwC0uNW8 Happy Father\u2019s Day to Charles, one of our @ObamaFoundation Fellows, and all the dads at Fathers\u2019 Uplift.

Through the #CommunityLeadership Corps in Chicago and Hartfo\u2026 The @USWNT is something to smile about.

Best of luck to these champions for equality, on and off the field. #OneNationOneTeam https://t.co/AHcHGATy5S Six years ago, David Ortiz's spirit and resolve helped us all begin to heal from the Boston Marathon bombing.

His seminal work, Boyz n the Hood, remains one of the most searing, loving portrayals of the challenges facing inner-city youth. He opened doors for filmmakers of color to tell powerful stories that have been too often ignored. Congratulations to the new class of @ObamaFoundation Fellows! Their work in every region of the globe is already making the world better, and I hope this experience helps them make an even bigger impact. https://t.co/azK2Y9Iw5c https://t.co/tuKO1SFhSK For thirty-six years, Richard Lugar proved that pragmatism and decency work\u2014not only in Washington but all over the world.

I\u2019m proud of her and all students striving for a better future. https://t.co/eD95oWrOk4 This generation of climate activists is tired of inaction, and they've caught the attention of leaders all over the world. So while this challenge is only getting more urgent, they show us the kind of action it'll take to meet this moment. And in the U.S., 13-year old @AlexandriaV2005 of New York, 13-year old @havenruthie of Denver, and 16-year old @israhirsi of Minneapolis are some of the young people leading the fight at home. I hope more of us will follow their example. https://t.co/qe08CGHBEI I met 23-year-old @luisamneubauer in Berlin earlier this month.

Have a great day, everybody. https://t.co/BtMyWebGLw The attacks on tourists and Easter worshippers in Sri Lanka are an attack on humanity. On a day devoted to love, redemption, and renewal, we pray for the victims and stand with the people of Sri Lanka. Notre Dame is one of the world\u2019s great treasures, and we\u2019re thinking of the people of France in your time of grief. It\u2019s in our nature to mourn when we see history lost \u2013 but it\u2019s also in our nature to rebuild for tomorrow, as strong as we can. https://t.co/SpMEvv1BzB Congratulations, Tiger!

Valerie is one of my oldest friends and advisors \u2013 she was by my side when I first decided to run for office and for every major moment of the presidency. @ValerieJarrett's voice has often inspired me and I know \u201cFinding My Voice\u201d will inspire others to lift their voices, too. https://t.co/nWTBDByMoz Last night I had the chance to meet with first-term Democrats in Congress\u2014it's a young, diverse class, stocked with a bunch of my campaign and administration alums who\u2019ve taken the torch.

And @SeforaKodjo is helping the next generation of women leaders in Africa rise up. Her organization is training and mentoring young women across the continent to adopt a new model of leadership, one that puts gender equality at the heart of economic development. https://t.co/cRb4EKcrvv .@BarbeAlice is helping refugees resettle into welcoming communities in France, offering them job training and language immersion, as well as a place to stay.

Happy New Year, everybody! I hope you find inspiration in the stories of Dejah, Moussa, Sandor, Hong and Jonny. Their journeys began with a decision to build the better future they wanted to see. The same is true for you. What matters isn\u2019t the size of the step you take; what matters is that you take it. Leaders like Jonny Boucher, a Chicago native who, after losing too many friends and family to suicide, started a coffee shop to offer emotional support and guidance to those who might be in need of a little more than a strong cup of coffee to get through their day. https://t.co/H6XPceR6d9 Leaders like Hong Hoang, who mobilized a youth-led movement to create a greener world after becoming the first Vietnamese person to visit Antarctica.\u00a0https://t.co/K8xPNC1OCQ Leaders like Moussa Kondo and Sandor Lederer, who are each doing their part to fight corruption in their native countries of Mali and Hungary.

If you need some inspiration, take a look at some of the young leaders who inspired me this year. As 2018 draws to a close, I\u2019m continuing the tradition of sharing my year-end lists. It gives me a moment to reflect on the year through the books, movies, and music that I found most thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved.

Over these eight nights, we draw inspiration from light that can overpower any darkness, and recommit ourselves to building a brighter future for our families, our communities, and our world. Chag Sameach from the Obama family to yours. America has lost a patriot and humble servant in George Herbert Walker Bush. While our hearts are heavy today, they are also filled with gratitude. Our thoughts are with the entire Bush family tonight \u2013 and all who were inspired by George and Barbara\u2019s example. https://t.co/g9OUPu2pjY I am grateful for the next generation of leaders -- the young people who are tolerant, creative, idealistic and doing the work to create the world as it should be.

Get inspired: https://t.co/dKLWPvrFPC Of course, @MichelleObama\u2019s my wife, so I\u2019m a little biased here. But she also happens to be brilliant, funny, wise \u2013 one of a kind. This book tells her quintessentially American story. I love it because it faithfully reflects the woman I have loved for so long. https://t.co/X0i9jja4TE Michelle and I are heartbroken for everybody who\u2019s lost so much in California, and grateful for the heroism of the firefighters who\u2019ve been risking their lives around the clock to save others. Please do what you can to help our fellow Americans in need: https://t.co/13rm1D6Rwk To all our veterans and your families: thank you. There's no tribute that can truly match the magnitude of your service and sacrifice. But all of us can do our best to live up to the American values of service, responsibility, generosity, and citizenship that you helped defend. Congratulations to everybody who showed up and participated in our democracy in record numbers yesterday. The change we need won\u2019t come from one election alone \u2013 but it is a start. Last night, voters across the country started it. https://t.co/gNk4WkeJUn Today is the day. Today, it\u2019s your turn to raise your voice to change the course of this country for the better.

When you vote, you have the power to make sure a family keeps its health insurance. When you vote, you have the power to protect voting rights. To make sure our criminal justice system treats everyone equally under the law. To strengthen laws that protect women in the workplace from harassment \u2013 and make sure they\u2019re paid equally. When we've been at such crossroads before, Americans have made the right choice. Not because we sat back and waited for history to happen -- but because we marched, and mobilized, and voted. We made history happen. Tomorrow\u2019s elections might be the most important of our lifetimes. The health care of millions is on the ballot. Making sure working families get a fair shake is on the ballot. The character of our country is on the ballot. Speaking of preexisting conditions, open enrollment starts today. If you or someone you know needs health care, visit https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod. Thanks to financial help, most people can find plans for $75/month or less, so check out your options and find a plan that works for you. https://t.co/R52X9sgkbP Elections matter.

All of us have to fight the rise of anti-Semitism and hateful rhetoric against those who look, love, or pray differently. And we have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun. The last presidential election turned on fewer than 100,000 votes in three states.

We\u2019ll miss him. https://t.co/orEXIaEMZM This National Gun Violence Awareness Day, show your commitment to keeping our kids safe from gun violence. Then, for everyone we\u2019ve lost, take action to change our leadership and our laws until they reflect that commitment - no matter how long it takes. https://t.co/lraIwlQAgl We can never truly repay the debt we owe our fallen heroes. But we can remember them, honor their sacrifice, and affirm in our own lives those enduring ideals of justice, equality, and opportunity for which generations of Americans have given that last full measure of devotion. https://t.co/pRxwmaMClL This Center is for the leaders of tomorrow who are ready to step up and build the world as it should be.

How inspiring to see it again in so many smart, fearless students standing up for their right to be safe; marching and organizing to remake the world as it should be. We've been waiting for you. And we've got your backs. Billy Graham was a humble servant who prayed for so many - and who, with wisdom and grace, gave hope and guidance to generations of Americans. We are grieving with Parkland. But we are not powerless. Caring for our kids is our first job. And until we can honestly say that we're doing enough to keep them safe from harm, including long overdue, common-sense gun safety laws that most Americans want, then we have to change.
