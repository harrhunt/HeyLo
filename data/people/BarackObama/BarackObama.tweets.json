But once the Supreme Court weakened it, some state legislatures unleashed a flood of laws designed specifically to make voting harder, especially in communities of color.

Here\u2019s my advice for the Class of 2020: https://t.co/XD2n7LEihk We\u2019ve seen the power that our voices have when we speak out about injustice\u2013\u2013but we also know the toll that it takes on our mental health. Today, I talked to @repjohnlewis, Bryan Stevenson, and @MBK_Alliance activists about ways to keep our mental health a priority at this time. https://t.co/PAsWb607EU On National Gun Violence Awareness Day, we #WearOrange to honor the victims and survivors of gun violence\u2013\u2013which continues to disproportionately harm Black communities. Then keep speaking up, voting, and changing laws across the country. Third, every city in this country should be a @MBK_Alliance community. We have 250 cities, counties, and tribal nations working to reduce barriers and expand opportunity for boys and young men of color. Join us: https://t.co/RZRwimA3SO Second, every mayor should review their use of force policies with members of their community and commit to report on planned reforms. We need mayors, county executives, and those in positions of power to make this a priority. Take the pledge: https://t.co/c8pAlhJsPJ First, there are specific evidence-based reforms that would build trust, save lives, and lead to a decrease in crime, too. You can find clear, actionable recommendations right here: https://t.co/V7b0mJoZiL Real change requires protest to highlight a problem, and politics to implement practical solutions and laws. As I mentioned yesterday in our @MBK_Alliance town hall, there are several steps our mayors and elected officials can take right now: In our @MBK_Alliance town hall yesterday, I mentioned James Baldwin's The Fire Next Time. From 1962, it remains a seminal meditation on race by one of our greatest writers and relevant for understanding the pain and anger behind the protests. Excerpt: https://t.co/50F9ZP3JhQ And third, an extraordinary essay by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces, Mike Mullen, explaining the values at risk when we start using our military to control domestic protests.\n\nhttps://t.co/ftmm5crbgg Second, a reminder of the difference politics and voting can make in changing who has the power to make real change in a community like Ferguson with a history of blatant discriminatory law enforcement practices.\n\nhttps://t.co/U0z9wMOx8z Here\u2019s a useful read\u2013\u2013a reminder of the importance of de-escalation by police in their interactions with protestors.\n\nhttps://t.co/Ondw85gQNL \"Let\u2019s do this another way. Let's stop thinking our voice don\u2019t matter and vote. Not just for the president...educate yourself and know who you\u2019re voting for. And that\u2019s how we're going to hit 'em.\" https://t.co/WX6oLNRtI2 Let\u2019s get to work. https://t.co/jEczrOeFdv I know the past few months have been hard and dispiriting. But watching the heightened activism of young people makes me hopeful. And if we can keep channeling our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, this can be the moment when real change starts. If you want to take concrete action, but you\u2019re not sure how, we\u2019ve created a site to connect you with useful resources and organizations who\u2019ve been fighting the good fight at the local and national levels for years. https://t.co/2KcB4T3b0I 5. The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away. 4. So if we want to bring about real change, the choice isn\u2019t between protest and politics\u2013\u2013we have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform. 3. To do that, we have to know which levels of government have the biggest impact. Changing the federal government is important. But the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels. 2. The point of protest is to raise public awareness, to put a spotlight on injustice, and to make the powers that be uncomfortable. But eventually, we have to translate those aspirations into specific laws and institutional practices. 1. The protests represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system. We should condemn the few who resort to violence\u2013\u2013not the overwhelming majority who deserve our respect and support. Ultimately, it\u2019s going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times. But I want to highlight some basic lessons from past efforts that are worth remembering: As millions of people across the country take to the streets and raise their voices in response to the killing of George Floyd and the ongoing problem of unequal justice, I\u2019ve heard many ask how we can sustain momentum to bring about real change. I wrote out some thoughts on how to make this moment a real turning point to bring about real change\u2013\u2013and pulled together some resources to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action. https://t.co/jEczrOeFdv My statement on the death of George Floyd: https://t.co/Hg1k9JHT6R If you believe in a more just, more generous, more democratic America, now is the time to fight for it. Here\u2019s a terrific way to register voters, organize communities, and ramp up turnout in the battleground states that will decide this election: https://t.co/FmN8RCJymg https://t.co/R5FZ6OBfxz On Memorial Day, we honor those who gave all for us.

I hope you\u2019ll all join me in honoring them at 2PM ET and 8PM ET. https://t.co/dBK5nll7w8 Vote. Michelle and I want to do our part to give all you parents a break today, so we\u2019re reading \u201cThe Word Collector\u201d for @chipublib. It\u2019s a fun book that vividly illustrates the transformative power of words\u2013\u2013and we hope you enjoy it as much as we did. https://t.co/ADYbL6Dzg4 Despite all the time that\u2019s been lost, we can still make real progress against the virus, protect people from the economic fallout, and more safely approach something closer to normal if we start making better policy decisions now.\nhttps://t.co/pfokyI8GiB Change comes when all of us step up and play our part in this democracy. By encouraging our young people, like these students from @ChiPubSchools, to start engaging in our civic life today, we\u2019re already creating something better for tomorrow. https://t.co/9ScwPruoyA Even if you can\u2019t give the moms in your life a hug today, I hope you can give them an extra thank you today. Thank you and Happy Mother\u2019s Day to the woman who makes it all possible. Love you, @michelleobama. https://t.co/E9ebxaSBpy There\u2019s no limit to the devotion I\u2019ve seen in teachers like these @ChiPubSchools educators. Their dedication shapes the best parts of who we become. I couldn\u2019t be more thankful for their work, especially as they shift lessons online to keep students on track during this crisis. https://t.co/xYECcrAxdE I\u2019ve always loved joining commencements\u2013\u2013the culmination of years of hard work and sacrifice. Even if we can\u2019t get together in person this year, Michelle and I are excited to celebrate the nationwide Class of 2020 and recognize this milestone with you and your loved ones. https://t.co/ngR2ykx3A2 The folks of the Chicago @fooddepository\u2014and food banks in communities like yours\u2014are working overtime to feed the vulnerable and families who\u2019ve fallen on hard times. But even as demand has spiked, donations have slowed. Their incredible efforts are worth supporting if you can. https://t.co/kSdijlyHLH The pandemic has magnified the financial insecurity of too many American families, the deep and real racial disparities in our society \u2013 and the imbalanced burdens on working moms. We have to create something better for America on the other side of this. https://t.co/eyy3dC22Ze In moments of crisis, we look out for one other. And we need leaders with empathy who will bring people together rather than drive them apart. @JoeBiden has the character and experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery. https://t.co/JkaBWYejKh This pandemic has painfully brought to the surface many of the reasons I launched @MBK_Alliance\u2014structural racism robs too many of our kids of their futures. The leaders on today's call aren't just tackling this crisis; they\u2019re helping us build a more equitable future for all. https://t.co/9dsedZYt0E If we want life to approach anything like normal anytime soon, we need a comprehensive testing program. It\u2019s not going to be cheap, but it will ultimately pay off many times over in saved lives, saved businesses, and saved jobs. https://t.co/pnN9KVcvQR While we continue to wait for a coherent national plan to navigate this pandemic, states like Massachusetts are beginning to adopt their own public health plans to combat this virus\u2013\u2013before it's too late. https://t.co/Eb2Hz8H8vU We've all had to adapt to cope with a pandemic. Climate change will force far harsher changes on our kids. All of us should follow the young people who've led the efforts to protect our planet for generations, and demand more of our leaders at every level. https://t.co/uNueQl5bNX Parents, you deserve a break \u2013 Michelle\u2019s got storytime handled every Monday. She\u2019s one of the best, I promise. (And I confess it makes me a little nostalgic.) https://t.co/Pmz8kRNMBC Proud of the leaders in my hometown of Chicago who are showing us what it means to be there for each other\u2013\u2013as neighbors and as citizens. https://t.co/DjnC1F9ph7 When I think of people I\u2019ve counted on over the years, Sarah Hurwitz comes to mind. She's the talented author of @HereAllAlong, and a longtime member of my team. Here she shares her experience with faith, traditions, and staying connected during this time. https://t.co/pftk4JkhKQ Democracy depends on an informed citizenry and social cohesion. Here\u2019s a look at how misinformation can spread through social media, and why it can hurt our ability to respond to crises. https://t.co/qnLcR3mh8A For all of us who love this country and are willing to do our part to make sure it lives up to its highest ideals \u2013 now\u2019s the time to fight for what we believe in. Join us at https://t.co/Kboaxi3MVL. And I\u2019ll see you on the campaign trail as soon as I can. I\u2019m proud to endorse my friend @JoeBiden for President of the United States. Let's go: https://t.co/maHVGRozkX Dreamers have contributed so much to our country, and they are risking their lives fighting on the frontlines of this pandemic. They deserve permanent immigration status and a pathway to citizenship\u2014as they are Americans in every way but on paper. https://t.co/e4IYqX3WIy We can't deny that racial and socioeconomic factors are playing a role in who is being hit the hardest by the virus. It's a reminder for our policymakers to keep our most vulnerable communities at the forefront when making decisions.\nhttps://t.co/aipc8p7Hwh Although our celebrations may look different this year, our unwavering faith remains the same. For me, Easter is a time of hope\u2013\u2013a reminder of rebirth and renewal\u2013\u2013and a belief in a better day to come. From my family to yours, we wish you all a blessed and joyful Easter. https://t.co/xEsgxOarQ5 Let\u2019s not use the tragedy of a pandemic to compromise our democracy. Check the facts of vote by mail. https://t.co/aTNxRV4Ws3 Everyone should have the right to vote safely, and we have the power to make that happen. This shouldn't be a partisan issue. https://t.co/gL38DpYEmu No one should be forced to choose between their right to vote and their right to stay healthy like the debacle in Wisconsin this week. https://t.co/fbDCbOb9qN Some good news: states that started social distancing early and aggressively, like California, have avoided overwhelmed health care systems. It\u2019s critical that we continue to listen to the evidence and experts and practice social distancing. https://t.co/56RgGeAfr7 Mayors have been working hard to help us get through this pandemic, and they\u2019ll have just as big a task to help people through hard times ahead. I spent some time with many of them today to thank them for their efforts, and asked them to keep up the good work. https://t.co/YzqPMPo8m2 Through centuries of persecution, exile and struggle, the story of Passover has reminded the Jewish people\u2013\u2013and all of humanity\u2013\u2013of the power to overcome even the greatest of odds. Michelle and I send our warmest wishes to those celebrating with loved ones at home or virtually. Social distancing bends the curve and relieves some pressure on our heroic medical professionals. But in order to shift off current policies, the key will be a robust system of testing and monitoring \u2013 something we have yet to put in place nationwide. https://t.co/evkTSrzReB My advisor and friend @cecmunoz has been someone I\u2019ve turned to for years. In her new book, More Than Ready, she shares her story and an empowering message to women, especially women of color, that they are the leaders we need to make a change in our world. https://t.co/6bQski6N23 It\u2019s World Health Day, and we owe a profound debt of gratitude to all our medical professionals. They\u2019re still giving their all for us every day, at great risk to themselves, and we can\u2019t thank them enough for their bravery and their service. Bill Withers was a true American master. His music, rooted in the everyday joys and sorrows of working people, was soulful, wise and life-affirming\u2013\u2013a perfect tonic for hard times. https://t.co/P8cusIny4k As she often does, @SenWarren provides a cogent summary of how federal policymakers should be thinking about the pandemic in the coming months. https://t.co/zkX0E7ncK5 It's Census Day and we all have a crucial role to play. Filling out the 2020 Census determines what the next decade will look like for your community: your roads, health care, schools, representation and more. Takes a few minutes by mail, phone or online. https://t.co/KzxFJKavmM We've seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic. We can't afford any more consequences of climate denial. All of us, especially young people, have to demand better of our government at every level and vote this fall. https://t.co/K8Ucu7iVDK So many Americans right now are stepping up to help their communities. Zohaib Begg, a 7-year-old from VA, is one of them. This inspiring kid has been gathering supplies from hotels to donate to the medical professionals at his local hospital. https://t.co/K8Pvp9Cyaq We are grateful for what he did for this country. He carried the baton longer and surer than almost anybody. It falls to the rest of us now to pick it up and never stop moving forward until we finish what he started\u2014that journey to justice. What a joy it was to watch him pray and preach. I took heart in him saying, \u201cWe ain\u2019t going back. We\u2019ve come too far, marched too long, prayed too hard, wept too bitterly, bled too profusely, and died too young to let anybody turn back the clock on our journey to justice.\u201d Rev. Joseph Lowery was a giant who let so many of us stand on his shoulders. With boundless generosity, patience, and moral courage, he encouraged a new generation of activists and leaders. Michelle and I remember him fondly today, and our love and prayers are with his family. https://t.co/xxjY2habOm During this crisis, our grocery store clerks, delivery drivers, transit and utility workers\u2014along with so many others\u2014have been selflessly getting up every day to make sure we have the things we need. And for that, we say thank you.\nhttps://t.co/Fq5qIRXt03 And this article provides a great example of the kind of community spirit that we need to get through this\u2014a spirit that we can hopefully learn to instill more of into our lives, workplaces, civic institutions, and government once the crisis has passed. https://t.co/xYZvspW4Ug Here\u2019s a useful overview of the likely scenarios that the world will be facing in the coming months while managing this pandemic. So much depends on our ability to make good decisions going forward along with our ability to remain resilient. https://t.co/uYpP1KfOUs These are the burdens our medical heroes already face in NYC. It's only going to get harder across the country. Another reason to maintain social distancing policies at least until we have comprehensive testing in place. Not just for our sake\u2014for theirs. https://t.co/bwNXhOPMYs Our medical professionals are heroes putting their lives on the line to keep our country going. Here's a look at how an ER doctor who already fought on the front lines of one crisis makes it through a day in this one. A good reminder for us to help them out by staying home. https://t.co/ah7vva9776 Here\u2019s a useful summary of the current best thinking among public health experts on how we need to approach the fight against COVID-19 in the coming weeks. https://t.co/7cy71sKLVG Ten years ago today, I signed the Affordable Care Act into law. It protected preexisting conditions, cut the uninsured rate in half, and lots more. But it's still under political attack right when we need care the most. We have to protect it, build on it, until we cover everyone. https://t.co/zz2v3DzMgq Sometimes it takes the wisdom and resilience of those who have been marginalized for all of us to remember the importance of community and mutual aid. And @cripchick, a disabled activist, understands what it\u2019s like for people with particular vulnerabilities to come together for support:\nhttps://t.co/aBAuBoMYFm .@sullydish witnessed the impact of HIV-AIDS on the LGBT community in the early stages of that devastating disease: https://t.co/j0ipIrzoDC Here are a few stories that have less to do with the very real medical or economic aspects of this crisis, and more with how we take care of each other as a human family during all crises: The best part of my job was meeting people like this\u2014ready to make a selfless act in a time of need. Many Americans are already making deep sacrifices to keep our communities healthy, but if you\u2019re able to, consider helping those hit the hardest. https://t.co/CdrMsC6VXF .@rgay and @SheaSerrano are using their feeds to directly support people in need\u2014and helping shift our ideas about how to approach giving.\nhttps://t.co/1JHPUYEiKV In my old neighborhood, the @BSAllianceChi established a crisis pantry to provide food and essential items for particularly vulnerable queer and trans residents on the South and West sides of Chicago.\nhttps://t.co/ilyDlj3ago .@ObamaFoundation Fellow @alexsmith1982 is helping seniors fight loneliness in the UK through a mix of new and old technology: online chats through Zoom and Skype, and postcards and poems shared by younger neighbors.\nhttps://t.co/GdnqDR8JJ4 Some great stories of big-hearted people coming up with new ways to come together\u2014even while remaining apart\u2014to help the vulnerable who face some very tough times ahead.\nhttps://t.co/kcBQK915jo In the meantime, remember to check up by phone on elderly or vulnerable friends and neighbors who may need our help. As communities have begun to recognize the importance of social distancing measures to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d on COVID-19 transmission, here\u2019s a sober but useful primer on what we should expect in the coming months: https://t.co/9oqdRF5J0Q We owe a profound debt of gratitude to all our health professionals and everybody who\u2019ll be on the front lines of this pandemic for a long while. They\u2019re giving everything. May we all model our own behavior on their selflessness and sacrifice as we help each other through this. https://t.co/F3tsJTqd4c Not everybody can stay home, and we owe a big debt of gratitude to health professionals, transit and airport workers, first responders, and everyone keeping our communities going. Leaders have to step up to support people whose lives and livelihoods take a hit in the weeks ahead. Watch this. It shows why we should all do the right thing and stay home to the fullest extent possible. All of us can help slow the spread of the virus, protecting the elderly, the vulnerable, and each other. https://t.co/FgffQrMVB7 A shout out to Kevin, Giannis, Zion, Blake, Steph and all the players, owners and organizations who are setting a good example during a challenging time. A reminder that we\u2019re a community, and that each of us has an obligation to look out for each other. https://t.co/cv1RZi9GGL If you\u2019re wondering whether it\u2019s an overreaction to cancel large gatherings and public events (and I love basketball), here\u2019s a useful primer as to why these measures can slow the spread of the virus and save lives. We have to look out for each other. https://t.co/Ld7Uc8sPTQ In the midst of campaign season, it\u2019s important to look squarely at what\u2019s at stake. This article speaks to one of the disturbing long term trends that we as voters and citizens need to expect our government to address. https://t.co/m49rbES0i6 RT @repjohnlewis: 55 years ago today, we were beaten, tear gassed, and trampled by horses. I thought I saw death. I thought I was going to\u2026 55 years ago, when a group of civil rights organizers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they carried America with them. Today, let's honor that legacy by continuing their work to protect and exercise our foundational right to vote. https://t.co/zhMeTA3kFj Protect yourself and your community from coronavirus with common sense precautions: wash your hands, stay home when sick and listen to the @CDCgov and local health authorities. Save the masks for health care workers. Let\u2019s stay calm, listen to the experts, and follow the science. Michelle and I are sending our prayers to those affected by the severe storms in Tennessee, especially to those who lost loved ones. Our hearts are with you and the first responders working so diligently to protect the vibrant communities of Nashville. America needs you as states prepare for the next round of redistricting. It's up to all of us to make sure we have a fair democracy. Join me in the fight for fair maps.\n  \nJoin me and @allontheline today: https://t.co/bTF7myfK5s Shirley Chisholm said \"You don't make progress by standing on the sidelines, whimpering and complaining. You make progress by implementing ideas.\"\n  \nAll across this country, right now, people are coming together to create extraordinary change. https://t.co/YTTfJYrYXW RT @ObamaFoundation: The Obama Presidential Center will make Jackson Park a part of presidential history.

She spent decades as a hidden figure, breaking barriers behind the scenes. But by the end of her life, she had become a hero to millions\u2014including Michelle and me. https://t.co/isG29nwBiB Happy birthday to one of my heroes \u2014 someone who believed our right to vote was more important than his own life. Thanks for making good trouble for 80 years, @repjohnlewis. https://t.co/LqMuvmpbLp https://t.co/AQJsfBf0ri Here are a couple of articles that are worth reading \u2014 from housing to health, these stories use data to explore challenges we face and demonstrate how policy solutions along with civic engagement can make a real difference in people\u2019s lives.\nhttps://t.co/G6EIUwuMqV Eleven years ago today, near the bottom of the worst recession in generations, I signed the Recovery Act, paving the way for more than a decade of economic growth and the longest streak of job creation in American history. https://t.co/BmdXrxUAUf RT @ObamaFoundation: It\u2019s a big day in Chicago as @NBAAllStar returns to our city for the first time since 1988. But before tipoff we\u2019re ki\u2026 Happy Valentine\u2019s Day to my forever dance partner, @MichelleObama. https://t.co/lHvTGUwEHr What a great example of citizenship, what each of us can do to make a difference for all of us: https://t.co/YxsvONUuVl Even if the methods are new, sowing the seeds of doubt, division, and discord to turn Americans against each other is an old trick. The antidote is citizenship: to get engaged, organized, mobilized, and to vote - on every level, in every election. https://t.co/yOvaCZYtrW Thirty years on, I remember the hope we all felt watching Mandela\u2019s release from prison. The gift of a new way of seeing. The chance to participate in the work of building a better world. The ultimate example of perseverance and faith for each new generation to follow. Congrats to Julia and Steven, the filmmakers behind American Factory, for telling such a complex, moving story about the very human consequences of wrenching economic change. Glad to see two talented and downright good people take home the Oscar for Higher Ground\u2019s first release. https://t.co/W4AZ68iWoY Sixty years ago today, the Greensboro Four stood up to injustice by sitting down at a lunch counter. Our journey is full of such stories; of acts of patriotic protest that challenge this country we love to live up to our highest ideals, however long it takes. #BlackHistoryMonth Kobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act. To lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day. Every so often, I re-read Dr. King\u2019s Letter from a Birmingham Jail. While some of the injustices may have changed, his poetic brilliance, moral clarity, and tests of conscience still reverberate today. Take a moment to reflect on his righteous call: https://t.co/oBdqFqdWA6 In every scene, you are my star, @MichelleObama! Happy birthday, baby! https://t.co/hgMBhHasBj Glad to see American Factory\u2019s Oscar nod for Best Documentary. It\u2019s the kind of story we don\u2019t see often enough and it\u2019s exactly what Michelle and I hope to achieve with Higher Ground. Congrats to the incredible filmmakers and entire team! Our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico can use our support after this week\u2019s earthquakes. They\u2019ve shown their enduring spirit over the past couple years, and it\u2019s up to us to pull together for one another once again. I hope you\u2019ll support their recovery: https://t.co/rYhSb8uVXK Here\u2019s the thing: Even with problems of this magnitude, each of us can still find a way to make change. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud of young people like Alice Mahar, a environmental activist in Melbourne. Read about her and find ways you can help, too: https://t.co/qAHFiBgw6b The catastrophic fires in Australia are the latest example of the very real and very urgent consequences of climate change. It\u2019s on us to stay focused and protect the one planet we\u2019ve got for the next generation: https://t.co/dqytauPeXf With David Stern\u2019s passing, I\u2019m reflecting on everything he did to take the NBA global, creating entire new generations of fans pretending to be like Mike or any of their favorite players on driveways and playgrounds around the world. https://t.co/8QMCazx2Fs Here\u2019s to a happy, healthy, and hopeful 2020. Happy New Year, everybody! From hip-hop to country to The Boss, here are my songs of the year.

I know he\u2019s got a lot more of that left in him. Praying for you, my friend. Next up are my favorite movies and TV shows of 2019. Of course, there\u2019s also American Factory, a film from our own production company, Higher Ground, that was recently shortlisted for an Oscar. Here\u2019s the full list: https://t.co/PEcgwotcxm As we wind down 2019, I wanted to share with you my annual list of favorites that made the last year a little brighter.

Voters should be picking their representatives. But unless we act, the status quo will remain in states all across the country. Let's make sure maps are drawn fairly when redistricting happens again in 2021: https://t.co/Pi2gd2B4bv Take a look at this piece to understand the very real consequences of gerrymandering.

It means more polarization. https://t.co/CLBQLPfTsu Young leaders like these are powering the promise of the Asia Pacific region. Michelle and I couldn\u2019t be more impressed by their initiative.

Tune in now at https://t.co/aGSLPSV4Fe for hi\u2026 RT @ObamaFoundation: Take a tour with @BarackObama through the future Obama Presidential Center on Chicago\u2019s South Side. https://t.co/n5n6s\u2026 Glad to be back in Chicago for the @ObamaFoundation Summit. It\u2019s where I first learned to organize\u2014and where I met @MichelleObama. We all have places that define us, and at the Summit, we\u2019ll be exploring the meaning behind them\u2014tune in tomorrow at https://t.co/swMRHuB5Y4. https://t.co/oymfsDZVnm .@SamanthaJPower is a Pulitzer winner, an incredible writer, and a great friend. Her memoir, The Education of an Idealist, grapples with the balance between idealism, pragmatism, advocacy, and governance. It's a must-read for anyone who cares about our role in a changing world. Michelle and I are heartbroken over the passing of our friend, Elijah Cummings. May his example inspire more Americans to pick up the baton and carry it forward in a manner worthy of his service. https://t.co/lM2rES3PNV I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term. In December, Michelle and I will head to Malaysia for the first @ObamaFoundation Leaders: Asia-Pacific gathering. The region plays an important role in my own story, and today, it\u2019s home to a generation of rising leaders ready to create a better world. We can\u2019t wait to join them. https://t.co/ldFDwXMi8J Yesterday, marathoner Eliud Kipchoge became the first ever to break two hours. Today in Chicago, Brigid Kosgei set a new women\u2019s world record. Staggering achievements on their own, they\u2019re also remarkable examples of humanity\u2019s ability to endure\u2014and keep raising the bar. RT @MichelleObama: Happy #DayoftheGirl! I\u2019m excited to share that in December, I\u2019ll be visiting Vietnam to meet some of the inspiring girls\u2026 Congrats to the @WashMystics on a gutsy, first-ever championship! A great team performance when it counted. If folks aren\u2019t careful, this title thing might become a habit in DC. Here\u2019s an interesting read\u2014a reminder that behind every opinion lies a human being with real experiences and a story to tell. Sometimes we\u2019ll agree and sometimes we won\u2019t, but if we want our democracy work, listening to each other isn\u2019t optional. https://t.co/8d4fPUprlu As President, I leaned on @AmbassadorRice\u2019s experience, expertise, and willingness to tell me what I needed to hear. In her memoir, Tough Love, you\u2019ll see why. It\u2019s a tribute to American leadership\u2014and a unifying call for us to do our part to protect it. I hope you\u2019ll read it. https://t.co/7iUWt76xUw Like the Beatles said: It\u2019s getting better all the time. Thanks, babe, for 27 amazing years! https://t.co/mImRqIYn1R On National Voter Registration Day, it\u2019s up to us as citizens to make sure everyone we know can make their voices heard at the ballot box. Check and update your registration at https://t.co/NKXRGNgbZX \u2014 and tell your friends, too. One challenge will define the future for today\u2019s young generation more dramatically than any other: Climate change. The millions of young people worldwide who\u2019ve organized and joined today\u2019s #ClimateStrike demand action to protect our planet, and they deserve it. Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet\u2019s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she\u2019s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her. https://t.co/VgCPAaDp3C That\u2019s what Americans do when others are in need \u2013 we help. We give. We inspire. Want to make a difference? There are a number of ways you can help right here: https://t.co/cnRcAfNIk2 Jermaine Bell is just six years old, but when he saw people in need, he took the money he\u2019d been saving for a trip to Disney World and spent it on food and water for South Carolina evacuees.\nhttps://t.co/H6xBIW4Ka0 Bahamian families and communities face a long recovery from Hurricane Dorian. And Americans are reaching out to help. Brittany Garvin is helping people reunite and evacuate. https://t.co/k5hXu68RPH As we remember those we lost on 9/11, we also remember the spirit of unity and togetherness that defined the weeks and months after. On this day of service, I\u2019m reflecting on all those still working to embrace that spirit, today and every day. https://t.co/y8x9PVcwDl Marca had a remarkable way of bringing out the best within us. For me, she was a trusted voice and a persistent, buoyant spirit\u2014an example that progress can be slow, but it\u2019s always possible. We\u2019ll miss her, but we\u2019re far better off because of her fight. https://t.co/gVkQvENtIs Yesterday\u2019s ruling is a big win for North Carolina\u2014and for all of us. Voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around. This win is proof that change is always within our reach, on gerrymandering, voting rights, and much more. https://t.co/sVlKm1JaIt Saw this story of a young person doing great work and wanted to share it\u2014keep it up, David! That\u2019s some creative organizing.\nhttps://t.co/bbkbf7vygr Training is at the heart of organizing. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve always made it a priority \u2013 from my 2008 campaign until now.

Hope you enjoy. https://t.co/BS5ri1lvxz A good story gives you the chance to better understand someone else\u2019s life. It can help you find common ground. And it\u2019s why Michelle and I were drawn to Higher Ground\u2019s first film, American Factory. Take a look at our conversation with the directors, and check it out on Netflix. https://t.co/KzkYFqjrFV Toni Morrison was a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. Her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination. What a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while. https://t.co/JG7Jgu4p9t Until all of us stand up and insist on holding public officials accountable for changing our gun laws, these tragedies will keep happening: https://t.co/reTnmcg3xo https://t.co/nNOVtQ50O4 The families of our wounded warriors don't often get a lot of fanfare, but they're serving and sacrificing right alongside their loved ones. We all owe a debt to them, too, and Fisher House is always making sure we're serving those who serve us. https://t.co/dqnvNk9cQR Recent court decisions make it clear that the change we need to restore our democracy has to come from the ground up. @Allontheline\u2019s work to ensure an accurate census count and achieve fair maps in 2021 has never been more important.

On Juneteenth, we celebrate the anniversary of that news - freedom - reaching slaves in Texas. And something more: https://t.co/kSkLHbfnc3 This is worth a read: a thought-provoking reminder that education reform isn\u2019t a cure-all. As a supporter of education reform, I agree that fixing educational inequality requires doing more to address the broader, systemic sources of economic inequality. https://t.co/96B7fkBM4u Yes we can, Greta.

And in the U.S., 13-year old @AlexandriaV2005 of New York, 13-year old @havenruthie of Denver, and 16-year old @israhirsi of Minneapolis are some of the young people leading the fight at home.

I am inspired by Robert and Vanessa and what\u2019s possible when leaders come together to have an even greater impact on the world. https://t.co/hFAMzW7tBq I\u2019ve always drawn inspiration from what Dr. King called life\u2019s most persistent and urgent question: \"What are you doing for others?\" Let\u2019s honor his legacy by standing up for what is right in our communities and taking steps to make a positive impact on the world.

Happy New Year, everybody! I hope you find inspiration in the stories of Dejah, Moussa, Sandor, Hong and Jonny. Their journeys began with a decision to build the better future they wanted to see. The same is true for you. What matters isn\u2019t the size of the step you take; what matters is that you take it. Leaders like Jonny Boucher, a Chicago native who, after losing too many friends and family to suicide, started a coffee shop to offer emotional support and guidance to those who might be in need of a little more than a strong cup of coffee to get through their day. https://t.co/H6XPceR6d9 Leaders like Hong Hoang, who mobilized a youth-led movement to create a greener world after becoming the first Vietnamese person to visit Antarctica.\u00a0https://t.co/K8xPNC1OCQ Leaders like Moussa Kondo and Sandor Lederer, who are each doing their part to fight corruption in their native countries of Mali and Hungary. Two people separated by continents but united in their pursuit of a more just, transparent society. https://t.co/YbOxSEyyCd Leaders like Dejah Powell, who started an organization to bring health and wellness resources to communities on the South Side of Chicago, expanding food access and providing people the space and time to take care of themselves. https://t.co/tPW7NxTGLO As the year winds down and we look toward 2019, I\u2019m asking you to make a commitment: find something you want to change in your community and take the first step toward changing it. If you need some inspiration, take a look at some of the young leaders who inspired me this year. As 2018 draws to a close, I\u2019m continuing the tradition of sharing my year-end lists. It gives me a moment to reflect on the year through the books, movies, and music that I found most thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved. I hope you enjoy it: https://t.co/qz6TCMKnkL Enjoy the holiday season with the ones you love.

I love it because it faithfully reflects the woman I have loved for so long. https://t.co/X0i9jja4TE Michelle and I are heartbroken for everybody who\u2019s lost so much in California, and grateful for the heroism of the firefighters who\u2019ve been risking their lives around the clock to save others. Please do what you can to help our fellow Americans in need: https://t.co/13rm1D6Rwk To all our veterans and your families: thank you. There's no tribute that can truly match the magnitude of your service and sacrifice. But all of us can do our best to live up to the American values of service, responsibility, generosity, and citizenship that you helped defend. Congratulations to everybody who showed up and participated in our democracy in record numbers yesterday. The change we need won\u2019t come from one election alone \u2013 but it is a start. Last night, voters across the country started it. https://t.co/gNk4WkeJUn Today is the day. Today, it\u2019s your turn to raise your voice to change the course of this country for the better.

When you vote, you have the power to make sure a family keeps its health insurance. When you vote, you have the power to protect voting rights. To make sure our criminal justice system treats everyone equally under the law. To strengthen laws that protect women in the workplace from harassment \u2013 and make sure they\u2019re paid equally. When we've been at such crossroads before, Americans have made the right choice. Not because we sat back and waited for history to happen -- but because we marched, and mobilized, and voted. We made history happen. Tomorrow\u2019s elections might be the most important of our lifetimes. The health care of millions is on the ballot. Making sure working families get a fair shake is on the ballot. The character of our country is on the ballot. Speaking of preexisting conditions, open enrollment starts today. If you or someone you know needs health care, visit https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod. Thanks to financial help, most people can find plans for $75/month or less, so check out your options and find a plan that works for you. https://t.co/R52X9sgkbP Elections matter.

And we've got your backs. Billy Graham was a humble servant who prayed for so many - and who, with wisdom and grace, gave hope and guidance to generations of Americans. We are grieving with Parkland. But we are not powerless. Caring for our kids is our first job. And until we can honestly say that we're doing enough to keep them safe from harm, including long overdue, common-sense gun safety laws that most Americans want, then we have to change.
