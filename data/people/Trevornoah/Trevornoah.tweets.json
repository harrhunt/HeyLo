Ok forget peace and quiet my phone's battery is at 10% and if it dies I won't be able to order food. The elevator is not working which means I'd have to use the stairs but the jeans I'm wearing are too tight for me to climb up stairs and I'm starting to panic...

When John Legend said that black people were oppressed, somebody in the audience cheered?\n\n #Oscars2015 @SimpNation 1st of May @miaseven well picked up Mrs Holmes. There's always that one ray of sunshine that finds a way to sneak through the curtains and wake me up early. @TheHeat001 yo Champ. I'm so proud of you man! I'll hit you up when I'm in LA. When was the last time you hugged someone? With their permission? Can\u2019t wait to get back to Dubai RT @Native_Quest: @Trevornoah lost in translation in Dubai I\u2019m getting tickets for me and my boys. @Phantsi_Komnga the irony is, that parliament comedy show it\u2019s costing you more than I can ever charge. @Daveylevinsohn you\u2019re visiting Joburg? I\u2019m so confused? @Trich1312 and just like that, we\u2019ve discovered my new look. Thank you! @KayosIsImmortal Easter! @Travon ok then you\u2019d escape and the police would shoot you \u201cby mistake\u201d because you fit the description of another suspect. @Travon Travon Bond would have been killed by the first villain. Want your woman to appreciate you?Take her to watch a movie about a super good looking billionaire sex machine! \n\n#50Shades Happy Valentimes Day! Often, people who can do, don\u2019t because they\u2019re afraid of what people that can\u2019t do will say about them doing. @DustyRich kill it bra Dust! Drake pulled a Beyonce on us. New album out on iTunes just like that. Remember that main point that Zuma brought up in his speech?\n\n#SONA15 @VivaAdrenalist9 lol I appreciate that Zach. @mgg456_ even though you might be in immense pain, this would bring me great satisfaction! @CINDIRAZE you\u2019re gonna have a great time, Vegas and the Blitzbokke! @johnunderhile @SHO_Network I appreciate that. Thank you John. @amyschumer @TrainwreckMovie love  it. @vanbizle lol that sounds like a great show- Mzansi meets \u2019Merica @fluffyguy can I come and hug you before you go onstage at MSG? @gill_ms it\u2019s on like donkey Kong! RT @ComedyCentral: Thank you Jon. http://t.co/yPdxjnkuLw If you\u2019re in California and you can drive to Irvine let\u2019s share a night of comedy this Sunday at the Improv. http://t.co/IAfs37jtgb Sorry, I don\u2019t have the energy. RT @kriel98: Come on @Trevornoah , give us an eskom joke. @kimmie_h09 lol your phone auto corrected funny to fiiiiiiine. @fvusani calm down. It\u2019s not up in flames those are just the candles we\u2019re using because of load shedding. All I need is one smile to keep me going. One person to enjoy it. One person where I\u2019m making an impact. The rest is a bonus. @joaomatthews_ shhh. Keep that info in the dm\u2019s. You\u2019re gonna lose followers and get me a visit from the police. I\u2019m so confused, is every car the car of the year?\n\n#Advertising @HighstandardNat I\u2019m not too informed but without it, many of our super heroes wouldn\u2019t exist. #Radiation Hopefully in November. RT @courtgilmour: @Trevornoah UH COME TO TORONTO. @LiLMickey08 nice one! I can\u2019t wait. @e23eec190ce847d yes. We\u2019re planning to release at Easter. Thank you for coming Alfred. New York. As always. Sublime. Next stop- LA. I hope it\u2019s snowing. @makamure I think assassination is usually determined by political motivations. @KPM8801 @lefasticated the worst is when they don\u2019t pause, they hit the ps button so the game carries on. I would never commit murder\u2026but if I did, it would probably be on a day where I had to wake up early. @Tasveer039 @barrybateman  yes because it\u2019s compulsory. Chicken and the egg. @Lencilspencil well technically it\u2019s not a much bigger tax base. But the served population is now gigantic in comparison. @barrybateman that\u2019s crazy. RT @chestermissing: Dear white commentators telling ANC to stop blaming apartheid, u would be so much more credible if u also pointed out w\u2026 @barrybateman is it compulsory? When I was in school we could choose Afrikaans or Zulu. Ek het Zulu gekies. @ShaunaNo5 smh I just read all of this. Thank you Twitter. You have informed me today. @joaomatthews_ but how do you really feel? @ShaunaNo5 ahhh ok. I\u2019m gonna go read up on this. Thank you Can anyone explain why @IGGYAZALEA gets so much hate? Is she the new Bieber to hate? @mgov14 I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m going to have to keep you in the dark. Sunday the 1st of March is the only show available. RT @LiLMickey08: @Trevornoah when will you be doing a capetown show trev? @ShaneShaman @REGYATES just give them the autograph and smile. If it makes their day it makes their day! Like Kim Kardashian keeping her clothes on, Beyonce just switched it on us. \n\n#Church\n\n#Grammys @Cvannie2 I\u2019m heading out to LA in April. I don\u2019t want to start something but it looks like Sia is Lip Syncing.\n\n#Grammys Is that Kristen Wiig dancing for Sia?\n\n#Grammys Kanye West just scared the shit out of all the white people in the world of music.\n\n#Grammys Music listens to Prince. #Legend \n\n#Grammys Rihanna just keeps winning. She\u2019s so beautiful. Kanye sings like he\u2019s rapping. Paul McCartney!\n\n#Grammys LL Cool J is Left Shark.\n\n#Grammys Tony Bennett has such an amazing voice. It sounds like a recording.\n\n#Grammys That dress made Katy Perry look like she has a baby in her stomach. \n\n#Grammys Obama on the Grammys subtweeting Chris Brown. Not cool.\n\n#Grammys You have to take your hat off to Pharrell.\n\n#Grammys @Travon did Pharrell just say he forgot to thank God earlier? @anthonyanderson congratulations brother. On a well deserved success. @DrewFrees that\u2019s truly hilarious. If PlayStation was smart, they\u2019d get Brian Williams to be their spokesman- \u201cPS4. So real, you\u2019ll think you were there\u201d News reporters are brave but I'm always more impressed by the cameraman who has to film while the reporter ducks. In honour of their great leader Zimbabwe decides to remove \"Victoria\" and rename it #MugabeFalls. http://t.co/w5XDEqmHYw @tponcian thank you brother. @dannypudi I did a guest spot at Second City. I could feel you in the air. RT @dannypudi: 'You laugh but it's true' is on the Netflix today!  Cool doc by these gentlemen @dpmeyer @Trevornoah  http://t.co/5FhONIMDk2 @mgg456_ not real soon but I'll be in San Francisco and Irvine in May. http://t.co/L7bDKHUiXq will have all the dates. Hope you can make it. RT @phlaimeaux: it'd be such a downer if your life flashed before your eyes and it was mostly you searching for emojis and listening to spo\u2026 @ComicalTshepo and some of the dopest beats around! Befday Yami, Siya Swima! #Legend I guess this is not the \"fall of Mugabe\" that the world was waiting for, but we'll take it!\n#MugabeFalls http://t.co/FHWUJKww7C @NickJon27328485 I could come earlier but I've been told that's a bad thing. @British_Airways so according to your website, there are absolutely no flights from London to South Africa using Avios, forever? @Sofia_Riba \ud83d\ude04 nice to see you had some jokes to go. RT @dillanoliphant: Bookings for my very first one man show at computicket.

Sports analysts spend the whole day predicting why the game will be unpredictable! \n#SuperBowl @suits thank you Matt. But we all know I'm the lucky one. @ToryDoobs you are far too kind. I had a great time though. Thank you @ericafinks I like your neighbours. So sad that somebody has died. Now how can I make this about me? - Death on Twitter @RyanGonaseelan I'm planning my show for June. @OliviaGoldin lol thank you for that. @Miss_Bouncy @MTNza even I am shocked. @elonmusk if we get electricity in South Africa, can we get the you to bring the Tesla out there? @JoannaKalafatis now you made me miss Cape Town by mentioning Cape Town. @StarbuckCay then I'll see you there! I'm in London on October 2nd. Join me at the Hammersmith Apollo and let us make magical comedy together. \n\n#SayYouSayMe RT @EventimApollo: EXTRA DATE ADDED! @Trevornoah has announced an extra date at the Apollo on 2nd October, tickets go on sale tomorrow at 1\u2026 RT @TrevorNoahShows: Hey Dubai!

Is there any plan to bring Tesla to South Africa? @Lesdoggg 1000 congratulations for all your success. Couldn't be happier for you! @eddieizzard knock em dead my friend. @CookDeSevilla ha ha. I'm glad you're enjoying it. Please wish him a happy birthday for me! Come on Bafana Bafana you can do it Senegal! That's why you shouldn't over hype things. It's 8 inches thick but nobody is impressed- New York Blizzard RT @AndyESalazar: Thank you @fluffyguy for introducing me to @Trevornoah via your YT channel! Love you both! @JasonSeptember that sucks to the umpteenth degree. @PartizanHenry but first let's get people to at least focus on them. Thank you for your insight though. If you having girl problems i feel bad for you son, I got 99 problems so i can empathise with people that have problems. @Adrenalineblush in a bigger venue I make it happen. There's just no space there. But I do appreciate the love. @PartizanHenry you are very right. But unfortunately the terrorists masquerade as such and so the label sticks. @1GurlRevolution that was the inspiration that I needed. Thanks for joining in! @MarkRatty thank you Mark. I'm having a blast. Ok, New York (but more specifically the people coming to my shows tonight) let's do this. @KumsdeVille you read one line and know nothing. Inform yourself before commenting. @REDfromZED please no controversial questions! I'm recording the @TheDailyShow podcast. If you'd like to ask me any questions then tweet now or forever hold your piece. @tomperriello thank you for agreeing. And 6 months after you're still telling us. RT @loyisogola: 6 months before the 2014 World Cup I said Germany would win the tournament. RT @phlaimeaux: farts are the digestive system's push notifications Thank you @RonandFezSXM for having me on the show, I really had a great time. RT @KaY_Worldz: SO @TrevorNoah was real when he said whenever Bafana Bafana lose xenophobia escalates #SowetoLooting If you're joining me at my New York shows this weekend please note, the only tickets left are for Sunday 10pm show. #AsYouWere @BelovedTessa definitely.

I'm merely against dirty feet not barefoot people. Some of my best friends are barefoot! @pearlgaitskill @andrewgoldie16 my brothers name is Andrew. He's also 21. Is this a trick? Yes I'm sure there's many shoes in the south. That's why I'm planning a show there! RT @galvez_cesar: @Trevornoah any shoes in the south? @CoMEdy_Yo dude I'm still laughing at Bane.

Comedians are not Football clubs. You don't have to only support one! RT @Aboujahjah: I am not Charlie, I am Ahmed the dead cop. Charlie ridiculed my faith and culture and I died defending his right to do so. \u2026 Did they draw cartoons? #JeSuisCharlie RT @Leandriii: Why no outrage for the 100s of people Boko Haram wiped out yesterday? @Minenhle_Soko your mom rocks!
