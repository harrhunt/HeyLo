@desertplantdan my designated lockdown appearance sweater is hand washed and steamed @pmlpiano nice i\u2019m slowly chunking my way through an einaudi music book @markofoxin just waiting for all the

breakdown either way i'm proud @obsechan in most social groups i'm basically just like a large plant in the corner so watching the show gives me a realistic experience @dapgoose literally watching the fire yesterday helps to get my tasks done with a sense of urgency @MaryAL_Official sometimes i stare back and laugh maybe there's a universe where they're watching me i started playing muted episodes

world out here people spontaneously shaving their heads in quarantine check your privilege some of us just have ugly egg skulls @_galaxydjh implying i don\u2019t look like a deranged hedgerow right now @softxlester stuff for a few projects that may have to be reinterpreted around the lockdown but we will see @liveshowsdnp the idea of the internet judging my shit island fills me with terror as i don\u2019t have time to time travel or the energy to trade so i\u2019ll be fine with my camping cot @rosedusthowell there was no victory this time but the agenda has progressed and the next generation gives me hope @SCORPIOSTYL3S very grateful we somehow got away with the last tour and managed to see so many people without something like corona @chillchaIamet i am a gamer rising up as i speak from the comfort of my sofa crease @theCassMeow16 we said that in january but every week there\u2019s a new bundle of fun @cheerlollypop got no vitamin d but i got a new bridge so that\u2019s nice @altruismnjh darwin chortling from the grave @twinklinglestr pperiodt @glamourlester a lot of piano playing and pigeon watching but also some writing @dipnshitz i feel this this was a make or break

can\u2019t relate @acciohowelI no stay pure @kimoxnam spill the pg @tooyounglarry i am so sorry i swear british gays be like \u2018and that\u2019s on full stopt.\u2019 if a board game isn\u2019t incomprehensibly german and take hours to set up and learn resulting in your friends staying overnight just to finish it then never speaking to each other again it isn\u2019t valid @Gelertthehound @sopekooks it's less about age and more a state of mind to whether you are open to growing and becoming a more accepting person or if you take societal progress as a personal attack when it clashes with your instilled values ..are you an ally? @nyctolust i'm sure it's devastating for many reasons and that's valid but hopefully now they can come together with genuine love as a family and move into a happier and more authentic future @camerahowell there will be young people who will see that it's okay and probably older people in the same position as him so it's really a big deal @thecaIIousheart big clown energy for that election interview for sure but let's appreciate this moment @sopekooks the boomers are out in force but that's why it's even more impactful that someone in his position lives his truth @upiinfIames disappointed but not surprised @huxhowelI he will have been battling internalised homophobia in an extremely hostile environment for decades so it's incredible that he came to this point today @devilish_sam_ a famous tv host in the uk came out as gay after being married for 27 years and it is the twitter shitstorm of the day people attacking phillip schofield for \u2018lying to his wife\u2019 need to understand they're both victims of the same homophobic society that made him feel he had to hide who he was to survive. yes it\u2019s sad for her, but it isn\u2019t his \u2018fault\u2019 and he's courageous for doing the right thing. @cnIyforever i fully support this decision @MacksMess lmao yikes ..like i feel the need to follow a lot of politics on here to stay in the loop but i know it\u2019s something i should spend less time staring into the abyss of @tinyphiI less influencers more iguanas i\u2019m here for it @citiesphil some people i want to follow but i just can\u2019t bear the photos so i hit a cheeky \u2018show me less\u2019 - the perfect crime @ineffablepml_ having a group of people you actually like to talk to online is literally a lifesaver so i hope it keeps going @spideyphil would you say my icon is an aspect of social media making your day worse @cnIyforever like even if it\u2019s temporary if something is stressing you out hit it with that lowkey mute and hope no one notices @Mel78Ger i mean i has myspace which was kind of better and so much messier than insta ..mainly the emo phase what you read on this feed has a real impact on your emotions and mental health\n\nwatch this from @youngmindsuk and ask yourself what energy and people you\u2019re letting into your life - own it and make this something that makes you feel good \u270c\ufe0f\n\nhttps://t.co/f2WBfOftuA shoutout to birthday boy @amazingphil who insidiously split his friends across five different social events for the next two weeks so he can have a separate cake each time ..may your sugar coma be eternal @whittakerdjh one day we will all glo up to be a beautiful slime @pinetreedjh mm yes squeeze me through the star shape then pound me into a flat disk i'm a naughty modelling compound @d0ntwantheavenn i only have one draft and it's cursed energy is so powerful we can't talk about it @hazelthesnek when the topical things are so awful you can't even make a joke the only direction to look is within the abyss @SEElNGS0UNDS time to sing our anthem ... form the banana form form the bana- @DaniboiSwan we have so much in common but if we ever met the mess would be irreversible and we'd both be trash @weirdkidlester but what is the default kate what if it's just a vacuum of annihilation @twinklinglestr i be licking a lot of that salty goodness as a child probably explains a lot i don\u2019t actually have a personality i\u2019m just a sentient ball of playdoh that becomes whatever form is necessary to make someone like me @fallindjh just for you i've decided to update things over here @frogphil i was taking meetings for potential future projects and it is literally as vague as that @xlilyymay i'm literally dying to but i don't know what @mysouldjh it's like a seance @Lau_Somi i'll be deported faster than the time i went to the bahamas @goincrazyfast every time is a good time but i will have things to share when they are ready @vibecheckhowell i find that label confusing so lets say basically i'm fluent @curehowell arguably none @couragedjh this is something we can all agree on @amordnp i

find it stressful but the fear of missing out made me even more stressed so i guess we\u2019re all trapped in this hellscape together forever @ZozyBell it is a time of many expectations but nothing is as powerful as deciding to stay inside if that is how you truly feel @musicothemisery a worm of serenity that says you\u2019re valid @poopypml treat it gently it is very smol but it wants the best for you to all my people stressed by new years as the passing of time forces you to think about your life and the future and now it\u2019s the end of a decade which is literally a whole crisis:\n\nhere is a calm vibe \u3030\ufe0f @whittakerdjh i am a big orange cheese puff emotionally so he is right say hi @parxdnp yes have a very happy hanukkah may  your candles flicker gracefully @SEElNGS0UNDS

@hellokittymugs anything to save me from the inevitable politics please merry christmas if you need me i\u2019ll be peacefully disassociating to avoid talking to my family if you're a young person that has gotten involved in politics for the first time - do not be disheartened. it\u2019s not your fault the boomers are trying to doom us, our generation stands for hope and change and when the
