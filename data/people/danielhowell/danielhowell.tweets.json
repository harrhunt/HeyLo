now @softxlester stuff for a few projects that may have to be reinterpreted around the lockdown but we will see @liveshowsdnp the idea of the internet judging my shit island fills me with terror as i don\u2019t have time to time travel or the energy to trade so i\u2019ll be fine with my camping cot @rosedusthowell there was no victory this time but the agenda has progressed and the next generation

incomprehensibly german and take hours to set up and learn resulting in your friends staying overnight just to finish it then never speaking to each other again it isn\u2019t valid @Gelertthehound @sopekooks it's less about age and more a state of mind to whether you are open to growing and becoming a more accepting person or if you take societal progress as a personal attack when it clashes with your instilled values ..are you an ally? @nyctolust i'm sure it's devastating for many reasons and that's valid but hopefully now they can come together with genuine love as a family and move into a happier and more authentic future @camerahowell there will be young people who will see that it's okay and probably older people in the same position as him so it's really a big deal @thecaIIousheart big clown energy for that election interview for sure but let's appreciate this moment @sopekooks the boomers are out in force but that's why it's even more impactful that someone in his position lives his truth @upiinfIames disappointed but not surprised @huxhowelI he will have been battling internalised homophobia in an extremely hostile environment for decades so it's incredible that he came to this point today @devilish_sam_ a famous tv host in the uk came out as gay after being married for 27 years and it is the twitter shitstorm of the day people attacking phillip schofield for \u2018lying to his wife\u2019 need to understand they're both victims of the same homophobic society that made him feel he had to hide who he was to survive. yes it\u2019s sad for her, but it isn\u2019t his \u2018fault\u2019 and he's courageous for doing the right thing. @cnIyforever i fully support this decision @MacksMess lmao yikes ..like i feel the need to follow a lot of politics on here to stay in the loop but i know it\u2019s something i should spend less time staring into the abyss of @tinyphiI less influencers more iguanas i\u2019m here for it @citiesphil some people i want to follow but i just can\u2019t bear the photos so i hit a cheeky \u2018show me less\u2019 - the perfect crime @ineffablepml_ having a group of people you actually like to talk to online is literally a lifesaver so i hope it keeps going @spideyphil would you say my icon is an aspect of social media making your day worse @cnIyforever like even if it\u2019s temporary if something is stressing you out hit it with that lowkey mute and hope no one notices @Mel78Ger i mean i has myspace which was kind of better and so much messier than insta ..mainly the emo phase what you read on this feed has a real impact on your emotions and mental health\n\nwatch this from @youngmindsuk and ask yourself what energy and people you\u2019re letting into your life - own it and make this something that makes you feel good \u270c\ufe0f\n\nhttps://t.co/f2WBfOftuA shoutout to birthday boy @amazingphil who insidiously split his friends across five different social events for the next two

find it stressful but the fear of missing out made me even more stressed so i guess we\u2019re all trapped in this hellscape together forever @ZozyBell it is a time of many expectations but nothing is as powerful as deciding to stay inside if that is how you truly feel @musicothemisery a worm of serenity that says you\u2019re valid @poopypml treat it gently it is very smol but it wants the best for you to all my people stressed by new years as the passing of time forces you to think about your life and the future and now it\u2019s the end of a decade which is literally a whole crisis:\n\nhere is
