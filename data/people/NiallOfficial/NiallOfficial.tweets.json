Not everyone is as thick skinned. we are normal people that do an abnormal job in which society has put us in a differet category for some reason. @niazempire It\u2019s effectively the same as walking up to someone in the street and just saying what you want to their faces... you just don\u2019t do it . @niazempire I\u2019ve been through this 1000 times to help other people. Because we are famous faces and people see us online, on tv, in interviews etc.... doesn\u2019t mean people can say what they want. @niazempire I respond not because Im personally offended by any of them ( in fact if you knew me personally you would know I couldn\u2019t give a shit about most things in life )I respond because I try to help people understand that you can\u2019t just say what you want to people online. @sweetIikestyles That\u2019s not very nice is it ? @flickerevans Of course I have . You\u2019ll seeee @CapitolRecords All of them . @xxpavxx @NiallHQMedia @ghostinlou If a paparazzi picture is taken at 1/15 shutter speed, what about all of the over movements in between the pictures eg: normal walking,  smiling, hand movements, eye movements ?? @ghostinlou By the looks of a picture taken at about 1/15 second shutter speed, NO. @niallspotatoo93 Oh really? @ashleig44666195 That\u2019s coz they haven\u2019t changed the billboards since lockdown Hahahaha . @Lucas03865131 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Go on my son .

Until we can get back to doing what we love, it\u2019s important we speak up and demand government support for all of the various venues, festivals and promoters. Live gigs and festivals can\u2019t happen without incredible hardworking teams behind the scenes, but without gigs all of those people are out of jobs and the live music industry is at risk. Today, we call on the UK government to offer their support. #LetTheMusicPlay https://t.co/4v2gdMSlBj @flickersnjall I think 22-25 degrees, small breeze @RUBIUSXNIALL Yes it\u2019s not easy because everything gets wet.

Don\u2019t have to get drive anywhere @helloxpetal The little one I use a lot more . . For a small guitar it makes a bigggg sound and it sounds great when I finger pick it . .

You might take production stuff away but never to that extent @Josefine_sand Bend the rules @flickersfire That playlist I made for zane Lowe\u2019s interview the other day, I\u2019ve been listening to that a lot @flickerpatience Yeh depends how ya start the song. If you start a song on acoustic guitar and it sounds sad, you also then have the option dress it up however you want production wise after. If you start with a drum groove or intense riff, it\u2019s hard to go the other way @harrryyisgolden Eat, walk, drink loads of aguaaaaa @lostonlewis Pub @thunderstovrm Helps if it\u2019s quiet and you can think about life etc @dearpatiences Don\u2019t think so babe @defencelesslilo Meeeee @lilflicker Definitely less pressure here @njhsbuddie Go @needytommo I agree @adamsniaIl Still @njhnewyork Melody has to come first..

See ya for the next one It\u2019s time for @GlblCtzn\u2019s One World: #TogetherAtHome ! Tune in now https://t.co/5gMwcVdxZJ https://t.co/67ILYYJCwO With greater support they will be able to reach so many more, always a priority but especially during this unprecedented crisis. It\u2019s a real pleasure to help such a great cause. Through interactions with the Irish government and HSE about critical and immediate support that Ireland needed, I found out that @ALONE_IRELAND was a charity doing fantastic work looking after older people all over the country. RT @ALONE_IRELAND: We are truly delighted &amp; grateful for the support of global star Niall Horan @NiallOfficial who has donated \u20ac100,000 to\u2026 @AnneMarie @LiveNation \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd70 @newangeIniall I won\u2019t .

Please join me in supporting them through the #CrewNation Fund by visiting https://t.co/MZHg60lmuo to donate or buy merch. @LiveNation is donating $5M upfront + matching the next $5M. https://t.co/5duM9m5Y4Y My good friend and legend @GaryBarlow invited me to his #thecroonersessions and here's our version of Slow Hands together https://t.co/jenHBGz0h4 @crossthetide Ahahah ... I reset all of my pedals up (took ages) and the last thing I needed to do was just flick on the amp , when I flicked the switch a fuse blew @niallerisart Depends @flickerhialler Yes my 1964 fender telecaster \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f @newstormangel Different guitars for different sounds . I know which one of my acoustics would be right for a certain vibe @dearwildflouwer Ahahah I was doing a session earlier @nialIsangel With zoom there\u2019s too much of a delay @nialIsangel We only have zoom on so we can atleast see eachother . We are actually using software on the computer where we can hear eachother and record as normal @armsofniallh A 414 @armsofniallh Yeh same mic . @damnnviall I wish it was easy to explain. Artists who don\u2019t write their own songs just record all the time. If you write your own stuff you are writing then recording as you go . . Hard to explain. Just write something and then record a little scratch vocal quick . @smalltaIknh Yeh good one today @nhtuned @Conor_O_Donohoe Yeh fuck him , look at that extended tricep \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 @JKCorden @NHSuk yes Malcolm !! Love it @ashleyft1d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 10 years since my Xfactor audition aired on TV. Lost for words to be honest.

We\u2019re just using zoom so we can see each other but we\u2019re hearing ourselves through software we have @flickernialls Conceptually i find it easier being home. More time to think of stuff to write about @natmyNH It sounds good actually yeh. We would all definitely prefer to be at the studio but ayeee @bndtherules At the moment we\u2019re just messing about, trying to figure the best way to use the software that\u2019s enabling us to do 3-4 way studio sessions. Complicated stuff. Written a couple of halves of songs etc and put down some riffs etc . we\u2019ve got time to make mistakes @dearpatiencie @crossniallsmind Yeh it\u2019s quite difficult but we\u2019re trying to make it work @yearsinthedark @crossniallsmind It\u2019s ridiculous. He\u2019s a major part of my life now and as you say i went to see him when I was 4 years old for the first time @thedaywestarted Tune aye ?? I\u2019m excited to join @GlblCtzn for One World: #TogetherAtHome, in support of @WHO\u2019s Solidarity Response Fund. A lot of incredible people are involved, it\u2019s one not to miss.

Have no way of getting it fixed @myirishfeelings Rumours @dncingmoonlight We would love to do that. I\u2019m sure one day maybe. We\u2019ve written together but nothing came of it. We\u2019ll try again @gotIoveforya No but I\u2019d love to or even play there @flickernialls Good actually . Late to bed tonight for some reason but I\u2019ve been good @_sxphss_ Yes.  On the loose, slow hands, since we\u2019re alone, bend the rules, PALLOM, San Fran, @niallhsunflwr Multiple occasions @yarahbw Heartbreak weather . Everywhere @njhftdolans Wow !! ..... best song is slow hands. Favourite song would be black and white , PALLOM, flicker @happilyval Heartbreak weather @dearpaitence There\u2019s so many guitar parts stacked on top of eachother on the record, we usually just take a part each . @ohgodmylarents Natural as possible . If you try and chase \u201c the hitty melody \u201c , you\u2019ll never find it @crssyourmnd Put a little love on me will always win that . @nhtuned Jane @nialltour Black and white @nhtuned I think I\u2019d have another go at slow hands . Slow hands was dirtier sounding before and I toned it back, wish I hadn\u2019t @NiallersNwAngel Heartbreak weather is a hard song to play and sing @NiallersNwAngel Still is easy to play but the tuning of the guitar is mental and I\u2019m not very good at finding it ahahah @harryseingblind Oh I have a few favourite Bruce albums. Born to run, darkness on the edge of town, born in the USA . Dancing in the dark would be a song that means a lot @soft_njh Went for a walk today and walked around where I thought of the idea for \u2018everywhere\u2019 , so I was having a reflective type day . @admitreckless Holy shittttt !!!!!

Juicyyyyyyy @NewAngelAng How to rock the fuck out like no one is watching @Ioveonniall What a question!!!!!! Dress would be just before still and nothin goes just after new angel @heartbreaktours @bIakandwhite The verses in heartbreak weather talk about what happened in San Francisco then San Francisco is talking about wanting to be back there @bIakandwhite About stuff that happened in San Fran . Heartbreak weather and San Fran are tied together Oh why thank you xxx https://t.co/WWgJLurVcz @smalltalkbaby In his late 60\u2019s he was still playing 3 hour sets in full stadiums . . As an artist you want classic songs and in turn you get longevity and I really look up to Bruce as he has all of the above . @smalltalkbaby He\u2019s got everything . Goodlooking dude, always dressed cool, he speaks to the masses with his lyric and his chat,wrote amazing sad songs and also rock classics, demanded the audiences attention and you can tell he\u2019s always loved what he does. @newangeIhoran Not think that I\u2019ve just put a sweater on?

She\u2019s my baby @starslitnight @hrtbrkweather The vibe feeling . If you get on a vibe with a song , it\u2019s goosebump stuff. It could be the saddest song ever ( it will make you cry and you won\u2019t stop) or it could so happy ( makes you dance and cry ) . They could be the worst songs ever but once you get that feeling,it\u2019s insane @heartbrkflicker @hrtbrkweather Indeed it is.
