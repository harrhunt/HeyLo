Legend RT @TonyBellew: Hope the whole city gets behind @AntArtist89 , He used to work with my brother on the railway.. Ashley used to always go on\u2026 Special night tonight watching that back! So proud of how far Anthony has come Here we go! https://t.co/cwuqPegVFY Hope everyone has a good day! @richardajkeys Seems like a very speculative opinion. Regardless of the debate I\u2019m not sure you can doubt Vardy\u2019s character after the journey he\u2019s had. Think about it mate @LiamPayne @FrencHMonTanA Big up to Payno and his EP @JamesArthur23 by replying to people who haven\u2019t even tweeted you directly is just added fuel to the fire. Just let it be lad Back to the studio for writing again today. Last few sessions have been going great. Moving along nicely! Now I\u2019ve got my final 6 I\u2019m proper excited for the next stage! #XFactor Exciting day for me today! Looking forward to it!

Love you all @talkSPORT Bullshit it\u2019s coming home @kabir_nizam We can always focus on the negative but undoubtedly the positivity running through the country is immense! @kabir_nizam Ridiculous to single out the idiots. Of course they are out of order but look at everyone else. There are always going to be people who take it too far I prefer to focus on the millions of people that are innocently behind their team. @kabir_nizam Naturally emotions are high this is the first time we\u2019ve got this far in our lifetimes! Regardless of where we end up it\u2019s been amazing to see the country so buzzing. Pipe down and enjoy the win tomorrow! What a performance! Proud of the lads out there. @JPickford1 you legend!

Devastating news, my thoughts are with everyone close to him. @MetroUK Good old Doncaster hahaha @roushanalam Actually pretty funny haha 420 ! Sick weather for it . Enjoy !!!!

Your patience has been amazing, I\u2019m working on rewarding it as soon as possible ! Together , let\u2019s do this !!! Can\u2019t wait for the day to finally release this album.

Thank you to each and every person who\u2019s ever supported ! @NBA2K_MyTEAM thanks a lot for sorting me out with this sick team! @Ronnie2K https://t.co/uws9pRw9V4 @supernovalwt Tell me about it . That was long \ud83d\ude1d @happilyavani Because that was the only category ( in the iheart awards ) that had more votes. Overall . Surely you understand now haha @callmebylex Keep up love. I\u2019m talking about all the other nominees in the other categories ( expect for fan army ) . You lot voted more than every category bar 1 @justIikechloe I was taking about the iheart award. Best solo breakout Honestly though , what an achievement ! Can\u2019t ever thank you enough #iheartawards So I just found out that other than the best fan army award you lot voted more times for me than any other nominee. I\u2019m honestly blown away. Best fucking team in the world I\u2019d say ! Love you all! Again thank you so much to everyone who voted for the iheart award! I saw how much hard work you put in! Lucky to have you all ! thank you so much , can\u2019t believe it !! https://t.co/wmNk6gIdJg Soz for the embarrassing brother tweet but I am so unbelievably proud of all my siblings. You are all so strong! Together we can get through anything , love you all so much ! @LiamPayne @NiallOfficial @Harry_Styles Unbelievable stuff ! Love you all @LouisPromoSquad 100% I\u2019m involved with every step of the creative. You have to feel comfortable on stage! Anywayyyyyyyy @Cogdon @BBCNews @Stormzy1 Really appreciate this tweet. It\u2019s a shame they have put such a spin on it but I suppose that\u2019s just journalism @LiamPayne @global Congrats lad ! Big love x @happilyavani I don\u2019t feel like they really answered my question though. Still good to have the debate @WYP_PC6746SAMH @WYP_PCSO143 @WYP_Keighley @WYP_PC27FOSTER @CravenWard49 Potentially,  used in the correct form however gloating about who\u2019s done what and who you\u2019ve put away only creates a divide. I saw one photo of a cctv picture with an emoji over the suspects face. Doesn\u2019t this create a certain tone? @WYP_PC6746SAMH @WYP_PCSO143 @WYP_Keighley @WYP_PC27FOSTER @CravenWard49 I\u2019m honestly looking for an answer to the question. Goes without saying the work the English police do is incredible but why the need for individual twitters ? @WYP_PC6746SAMH @WYP_PCSO143 @WYP_Keighley @WYP_PC27FOSTER @CravenWard49 Help me understand why individual police officers need their own Twitter? Surely as law enforcement you should be rising above \u2018venting\u2019 to your followers. All this does is cause arguments between people online and the police. Good session today with good people ! @louputation Nope :) RT @iHeartRadio: \u2b50\ufe0f\u00a0#LouisTomlinson #BestSoloBreakout #iHeartAwards \u2b50\ufe0f https://t.co/Faxvj7eZxf I can see how much hard work everyone has put into voting .
