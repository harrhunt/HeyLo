Potentially @lbfcult @tumblrisaa Bit of an obvious question though wasn't it haha @livewher My Nan. Incredible woman @tumblrisaa What do you think!? @anxiouslemons Trust your gut. Be individual @harryshoaxx Patience. It'll be ready really soon @esnyofacopy 369 @hesgrow Lots of stuff in early stages. Music obviously remains my number 1 priority @pancakelouie These things take time. There won't be any developments for a while. Slow burner @Honor_Sandi The next time I play a live show. Going to be an incredible atmosphere @ohmsbrave Haven't written it yet @wallscreature @whatamiiinow That's crazy. Very proud moment for me @habitualjimin Enjoy @berlykate Good thanks!

Top lad and top keeper Massive congrats for the call up @samjohnstone50 @Rodders232 @samjohnstone50 Deserves every bit of success! Hope everyone's doing alright!! @thelittlegend No @94WONDERLAND Working on the new merch. I'll keep you posted with with @farawaylouis Sometimes action is needed first to encourage the motivation and belief P.s. a management company not a label I just wanted to take the first step of actualising the idea but at this stage that's all this is. An idea! So I've decided to put it out there in the world today. I'm going to start my own music management company to help develop new artists. Watch this space I always dreamed of having my own label, having an imprint never really worked for me because I still had to have someone else's blessing to sign people. People I believed in massively but unfortunately didn't fit the traditional pop role hence never doing the deals.... Just read up on @Shadow_Official . Very clever idea! Hope everyone is alright! Had my wisdom teeth out recently, ruthless stuff! I'll be on in a few days. Sending you all love Just want to acknowledge everyone who has helped with Defenceless. These moments make me immensely proud and reinforces with your support we're unstoppable. @dwfenceless Still in two minds. Maybe one day @LTxPromo Great question. Walls, only the brave, kill my mind, copy of a copy @donnyslwt @wallslwts No concrete plans because I don't need that pressure while I'm writing. I'm sure I will have something out this year but unlikely that will be the album. Who knows though! @louloveslouies Soon! @Iouisvalerie @jdaekims Really good thank you!

Great cast! Most proud of Walls though! @tinystarlouis Loyalty** @eternalsunloui1 Recording the strings on the single for walls is up there @sunflowerfender @louiesforlouis The two shows I played @jazmineloveslou Either kill my mind or walls @louiesforlouis Incredible! @Tommoisourking1 Don't think so.

I was going to do some merch but I didn't want to market the day. Just wanted it to be a celebration for us! I'll be on later to reply! 1 year of my first album Walls. Crazy how quick the time has gone. When I finally get to tour this album it's going to be fucking unbelievable! Sending you ALL a massive thank you for everything you do! This is our day! @BoneheadsPage Not yet I'll watch it in the next few days! I watched some of the Michael Jordan series, still got a few episodes to watch but Phil Jackson's school of thought and his way of understanding each individual was incredible to see!

I was lucky enough to see Avicii\u2019s last show in Ibiza and what a fucking show it was! Such a talent. Devastating news, my thoughts are with everyone close to him. @MetroUK Good old Doncaster hahaha @roushanalam Actually pretty funny haha 420 ! Sick weather for it . Enjoy !!!! Spent too much energy worrying and being frustrated with the process a little bit. Time to start fucking winning now ! Got some important meetings out the way and now I\u2019m fucking ready! Your patience has been amazing, I\u2019m working on rewarding it as soon as possible ! Together , let\u2019s do this !!! Can\u2019t wait for the day to finally release this album. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve been working towards over the last two years. Monthly thank you for all your patience . Believe me we\u2019re getting close! Really excited about a couple of the new songs. Early morning football. Happy days Sick game today , @Ibra_official took the piss when he came on. What a banger !! New @thevaccines album is siiiick @HKTourismUK 100% 8 years today I went for my first audition on the X factor. Thanks you to my beautiful mum for talking me into going! Thank you to each and every person who\u2019s ever supported ! @NBA2K_MyTEAM thanks a lot for sorting me out with this sick team! @Ronnie2K https://t.co/uws9pRw9V4 @supernovalwt Tell me about it . That was long \ud83d\ude1d @happilyavani Because that was the only category ( in the iheart awards ) that had more votes. Overall . Surely you understand now haha @callmebylex Keep up love. I\u2019m talking about all the other nominees in the other categories ( expect for fan army ) . You lot voted more than every category bar 1 @justIikechloe I was taking about the iheart award. Best solo breakout Honestly though , what an achievement ! Can\u2019t ever thank you enough #iheartawards So I just found out that other than the best fan army award you lot voted more times for me than any other nominee. I\u2019m honestly blown away. Best fucking team in the world I\u2019d say ! Love you all! Again thank you so much to everyone who voted for the iheart award! I saw how much hard work you put in! Lucky to have you all ! thank you so much , can\u2019t believe it !! https://t.co/wmNk6gIdJg Soz for the embarrassing brother tweet but I am so unbelievably proud of all my siblings. You are all so strong! Together we can get through anything , love you all so much ! @LiamPayne @NiallOfficial @Harry_Styles Unbelievable stuff ! Love you all @LouisPromoSquad 100% I\u2019m involved with every step of the creative. You have to feel comfortable on stage! Anywayyyyyyyy @Cogdon @BBCNews @Stormzy1 Really appreciate this tweet. It\u2019s a shame they have put such a spin on it but I suppose that\u2019s just journalism @LiamPayne @global Congrats lad ! Big love x @happilyavani I don\u2019t feel like they really answered my question though. Still good to have the debate @WYP_PC6746SAMH @WYP_PCSO143 @WYP_Keighley @WYP_PC27FOSTER @CravenWard49 Potentially,  used in the correct form however gloating about who\u2019s done what and who you\u2019ve put away only creates a divide. I saw one photo of a cctv picture with an emoji over the suspects face. Doesn\u2019t this create a certain tone? @WYP_PC6746SAMH @WYP_PCSO143 @WYP_Keighley @WYP_PC27FOSTER @CravenWard49 I\u2019m honestly looking for an answer to the question. Goes without saying the work the English police do is incredible but why the need for individual twitters ? @WYP_PC6746SAMH @WYP_PCSO143 @WYP_Keighley @WYP_PC27FOSTER @CravenWard49 Help me understand why individual police officers need their own Twitter? Surely as law enforcement you should be rising above \u2018venting\u2019 to your followers. All this does is cause arguments between people online and the police. Good session today with good people ! @louputation Nope :) RT @iHeartRadio: \u2b50\ufe0f\u00a0#LouisTomlinson #BestSoloBreakout #iHeartAwards \u2b50\ufe0f https://t.co/Faxvj7eZxf I can see how much hard work everyone has put into voting .
