I did so recently in my essay \u2018TERF Wars\u2019.

I love that very skilfully coloured moonlit background, too! #TheIckabog https://t.co/giPUms7Kx9 Oh, Manushi \ud83d\udc94This is a marvellous drawing of poor Daisy - you've even put her into that yellow dress her mother sewed for her. Wonderful and sad at the same time! #TheIckabog https://t.co/cWxpTH6Gu7 Kaja, this is a wonderful drawing of the fight between Bert and Daisy! You've put so much feeling into the two main characters: Daisy looks as though she really means business! I also love the shock on the other children's faces and that wandering, unconcerned peacock #TheIckabog https://t.co/iVutzviYha Zurain, this picture is spectacular! It looks like a dreamscape with that gorgeous sky. I love the king, Spittleworth and Flapoon sunk in the swamp, the magnificent dragon-like monster and the way you've hung the lamp on the name 'Ickabog'! #TheIckabog https://t.co/MmCE2bz4dE Annika, I love these gorgeous baskets of mushrooms! They really do look as though they come from a faraway, fairy-tale land - I can see why the Ickabog enjoys them! #TheIckabog https://t.co/ucvuAgQBmy Chris, this is one of my favourite maps so far! I love the way you've differentiated the towns by the colour of their buildings and the light-to-dark, south-to-north shading, which symbolises the way the story progresses as well as Cornucopia's fear of the marshlands! #TheIckabog https://t.co/9f6FODJGHz I haven't seen many Private Prodds, Jonas, so this is a treat, especially as it's a WONDERFUL drawing! He looks cruel and crafty, as he should, (although he wasn't quite as bad as Spittleworth hoped). Keep reading and you might just find out what happened to Prodd... #TheIckabog https://t.co/X1r2MepFdQ Ah, another AMAZING window picture! Rylie, you've got so much emotion into this, even though there isn't a human in sight. The moon looks melancholy with those bars criss-crossing it and yet it gave Daisy hope that something bigger and better lay ahead... #TheIckabog https://t.co/Ogfsn5lCFw A magnificent butcher's shop from Baronstown! This is clearly back in the days before Lord Spittleworth plunged the kingdom into poverty! #TheIckabog https://t.co/7JXDqo8XAo I love this bright blue dragonish snake-tongued Ickabog - a combination of all the stories once told about the fearsome monster! #TheIckabog https://t.co/s9NbXTIqGz Srijoni, this is a fantastic picture of Cornucopian pastries, each one beautifully designed and drawn! You've made your picture look dreamlike with that hazy sky - I love it! \n#TheIckabog https://t.co/m2S2skvXPy Isla-Rose, this is ANOTHER amazing picture from you! And I'm so touched by you saying 'because they're all frightened really', because fear is such an important part of this story and you understand that. #TheIckabog https://t.co/dl4Bs48lN0 I really love this picture, Viviana, because you've made Fred look SO pleased with himself, his fake fan letter in his hand and his crown tilted roguishly to one side! #TheIckabog https://t.co/0gKZxipxMQ Sonal, this is a beautifully-executed, simple and striking image and those are often the very best! The division between danger and safety (or truth and lies) is often as thin as a pane of glass! #TheIckabog https://t.co/mhxLNvL7cw This is such a BEAUTIFUL map, Swastyayan! I love the livestock, the different produce, the variety of buildings and, of course, the mushroom-strewn north with its dark marsh. Wonderful! #TheIckabog https://t.co/7qcsggkj64 Ivars, I love it! You've captured and drawn all the things whirling around in my head and I LOVE that one-eyed monster and the handsome blond Fred! #TheIckabog https://t.co/D9DVTboCvj Josie, I love all the beautiful detail you've put in here - the patches on the blankets, the twinkling snowflakes - and you've given every character their own distinct personality! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Sv81ifO9qt Orson, I'd recognise your style anywhere and I stand by my previous comments: you'd make a great satirical cartoonist! I LOVE this very funny picture of the fraudulent Widow Buttons weeping for her Nobby! #TheIckabog https://t.co/ZiYwqecpEi Magnificent as ever, Rob! #TheIckabog https://t.co/5no8kkuRWn You're only six, Pratulya? That's AMAZING! I love this simple but very effective picture of Mrs Beamish behind the curtain! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/NW8mFlLU0T One of my very favourite pictures of the foursome setting out on their journey north! The colours are beautifully wintery. I love those red roofs against the snow, Ella! #TheIckabog https://t.co/rdqwJjVql6 This is a fabulous picture of Bert hiding in the beetroot patch! I especially love that beam of light just missing him! Happy birthday for Monday, Eva! #TheIckabog https://t.co/6tYyWJdBnK Archie, I absolutely love your Lego Ickabog characters, particularly Lord Spittleworth, because he reminds me of Elvis \ud83c\udfb8#TheIckabog https://t.co/ZjnygQ98aZ I love this picture of the accident on the marsh, Bertie! I especially like the way Flapoon's half-hidden in the fog and is that the Ickabog I spy, hiding in that tree? #TheIckabog https://t.co/Rezi43QB6i That's the best thing I could possibly hear, Cora-Marie. I'm truly honoured.

A truly ferocious and frightening Ickabog - I love it! #TheIckabog https://t.co/jMzdl5XpdQ A truly terrifying Ickabog... (I love it. Thank you so much! You're a very kind Slytherin \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc0d) https://t.co/AuCcWJIPmr Scarlett, I LOVE your butcher's shop with all the delicious things in its window! This is such a happy picture of the time when Cornucopia was (mostly) contented and well-fed! #TheIckabog https://t.co/LmDhrUXL3M Ah, poor Mrs Dovetail... a sad and dramatic picture! It truly shows why everything started to go wrong for Cornucopia! #TheIckabog https://t.co/5g7NVNN4d6 Yes, Robert's publishing Troubled Blood on September 15th! https://t.co/KJWpJMnr5M Anya, judging by this picture I can totally see why King Fred and Lord Spittleworth fell in love with Lady Eslanda! She looks not only pretty but kind (as she should) - you're a very talented artist! #TheIckabog https://t.co/J4QNNkmGzW Hello Miss Higgins' Year 6 Class! I absolutely love your pictures of King Fred the Fearless! They're all so different and all wonderful! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/3prb5b2U7r Wow... this made me FEEL the relief and happiness Bert and Daisy experienced on recognising each other. What an amazing picture \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f #TheIckabog https://t.co/8XVWqkzE7p Our poor, freezing heroes on a snowy marsh: I love this picture because they all look genuinely scared and cold and each has his or her own distinct personality! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/96L2cd0tXl Yuxin, these are just beautiful! You're so talented! It's very hard to choose a favourite, because all four are excellent, but I particularly love Fred on the marsh (which must be opened up to be fully appreciated) and Lady Eslanda by lamplight! #TheIckabog https://t.co/ubJN39jdHl A beautiful, hopeful picture of the Beamish and Dovetail families in happier times! I especially love Daisy's daisy-patterned yellow dress and Bert waving the flag! #TheIckabog https://t.co/YWuVfUqV8R Six?! Mira, how is that possible? These are AMAZING! I love the image of the mythical, dragonish monster beside the crocodile-infested swamp and I love the huge, smiling Ickabog holding all the frozen children! #TheIckabog https://t.co/MloCx0e1C0 Rishika, your picture of Lady Eslanda is simply stunning! It's not only beautifully drawn but you've given her a serious, worried look that perfectly fits the character! (I also like her freckles) #TheIckabog https://t.co/s3dXCK0OVN Maddox, from the patches on Daisy's clothes to the smiles on their faces, I absolutely love this picture of Bert and Daisy hugging after all their years apart! #TheIckabog https://t.co/eLrLdUaSFs Thomas, you've drawn one of my very favourite Ickabog pictures out of all I've seen! I love your marshweedy monster and I love what you've got him saying, too! #TheIckabog https://t.co/sY1O6JRkDw Sydney, you've used colour so effectively here, making the marsh monster with its gleaming eyes stand out against that beautiful night sky - gorgeous and quite scary! \n\ud83d\udc9a\ud83c\udf19\ud83d\udc9c #TheIckabog https://t.co/IyYye9Q93J Prajit, I opened up this picture and I gasped! Everybody needs to see the whole thing to understand how amazing it is! One of the most spectacular Ickabogs I've seen! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f #TheIckabog https://t.co/1K9PeWdKXl Lily, this is the most EXTRAORDINARY painting! The cracks in the old bowl, the leaking soup, the cabbage leaves, the flies - bravo! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f#TheIckabog https://t.co/nkNW4uvd13 Ella, this isn't only a marvellous drawing (love the detail on the curtain rail and the tassles), you've given Mrs Beamish exactly the right expression! She's determined to tell the king the truth, even though she's scared, and you've made her look determined! #TheIckabog https://t.co/GJBnTd7zAt Nina, I doodled an Ickabog while writing the story and found it in the box when I got the story down from the attic. Yours is the closest to mine I've seen so far, so naturally I absolutely love it, from the marshweedy hair to the big sad eyes! \ud83d\udc9a#TheIckabog https://t.co/GYXJJSJIGZ Ah, dear old Professor Fraudysham! Who could mistrust this loveable character, Am\u00e9lie? I love everything about him from his thick-lensed glasses to his I-am-clearly-a-scientist pockets full of pens and syringes! #TheIckabog https://t.co/nj1K9dBFO5 I can tell he appreciates the socio-political undertones while remaining sceptical of my ability to bring this story to a satisfying conclusion. I fear his judgment while craving his approval. Please send his verdict on July 10th. https://t.co/1s58mLZkHW \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02 https://t.co/bFXxUPWpAz Daniyal, this is an INCREDIBLE picture of a Baronstown butcher's should- (obviously in happier times than we've reached in the story!) The look of all the different meat and the wonderful detail on the wall behind the shopkeeper is extraordinary! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f#TheIckabog https://t.co/ODsIabc8JW Murray, this is one of the very best maps I've seen so far! I love all the amazing detail you've put in here, with the produce and the livestock for each area and that gorgeous palace! The faded colours are perfect! #TheIckabog https://t.co/3XEgRKYl86 Viviana, I LOVE this picture so much! It's a simple but striking image and the way those arms are reaching out could be intimidating or comforting - wonderful job\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f #TheIckabog https://t.co/SJ40Jwcnzn Violet, I absolutely love this picture of Spittleworth and Flapoon looking grim and bored either side of happy Fred! The king looks sweet and happy here and the two lords look monstrous, which is just right! (And thank you, Owen) #TheIckabog https://t.co/N9SFnYLH9S Makai, this is a MAGNIFICENT Ickabog, both scary (love those fangs and claws) and cuddly (covered in long greenish-brown hair like marshweed)! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/1IZpEIB9xr Gabriella, I LOVE these four, especially the way Daisy and Martha are holding hands (they've grown to be almost like sisters, after all) and the braced look of Bert and Roderick as they set out on their great adventure! #TheIckabog https://t.co/uvqdaxNM5L Rylie, I have to believe you're ten, because I can see in the picture you aren't an adult, but this is a stunning picture of roses and I would have believed anyone who told me a grown-up had drawn them! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Uqkt8L4JkI Olivia, my jaw just dropped! I love everything about this gorgeous drawing! You've added so much wonderful detail and Fred's look of detachment and pride is perfect! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/xhqr9mpeM6 Please have your daughter post it online with the hashtag #TheIckabog! https://t.co/tt2jaYDgE2 This is a FANTASTIC picture of Bert hiding in the beetroot patch! I love his expression, the soldier's lethal-looking sword and the detail visible through the lit window! #TheIckabog https://t.co/726jVXEYJg Plaksha, this is simply spectacular! I love every part of the design and you've executed it beautifully! It really does look as though it was produced one upon a time in Cornucopia! #TheIckabog https://t.co/pur5zpg52Z Divyanishi, this is one of the best jewelled swords I've seen so far! So much gorgeous detail and I love the surprise at the bottom of the hilt (which makes me think of a certain other sword...) #TheIckabog https://t.co/sfr7uO1CWf Arturo, I love your terrifying Ickabog sucking up houses! You've made the monster truly scary and bizarre - that dangling eyeball is a fabulous touch! #TheIckabog https://t.co/8jYyaXzJDK RT @TheIckabog: We've had so many incredible drawings shared with us so far for #TheIckabog! Here are some highlights. https://t.co/W2YEEsC\u2026 A beach. https://t.co/f9vJQ6ZNz7 @lascapigliata8 @tribunemagazine I'm so very, very sorry for what you went through. This comes with love and solidarity, sister \u2764\ufe0f @BluXIIV @lloyd_rm @UKLabour You're not a 'face in the crowd' to me. You're one of the many people who've given me strength and comfort and I won't ever forget any of you. @DreyfusJames @lloyd_rm @UKLabour James, you've been with us from the first and we won't forget. Thank you x @Locko8668 @StephenKing And we won't forget, believe me. @bindelj the feeling is entirely mutual, Julie, as you well know xxx @RadfemJana @tribunemagazine I saw that happen to you, Jana, and I was appalled. I'm so very sorry for what you experienced. You're an inspiration to me and to many in the way you're standing up for girls. \u2764\ufe0f @mytw68 @lloyd_rm women like you have got me through \u2764\ufe0f @emdale23 @tribunemagazine And I'm indebted to all of you for your support. You've been incredible and I'll never be able to fully express my gratitude. @worriedmumofone @tribunemagazine That means everything to me. This comes with love and soldarity\ud83d\udc95 I accept @lloyd_rm's apology in the hope that he\u2019ll dig a little deeper than hashtags and slogans. He might then understand why increasing numbers of people are deeply concerned about @UKLabour\u2019s position on women\u2019s rights. 9/9 Andrea Dworkin wrote: \u2018Men often react to women\u2019s words\u2014speaking and writing\u2014as if they were acts of violence; sometimes men react to women\u2019s words with violence.\u2019 It isn't hateful for women speak about their own experiences, nor do they deserve shaming for doing so. 8/9 When so-called leftists like @lloyd_rm demand that we give up our hard won sex-based rights, they align themselves squarely with men\u2019s rights activists. To both groups, female trauma is white noise, an irrelevance, or else exaggerated or invented. https://t.co/4Axo36pGWt 7/9 https://t.co/vhvQRVRGHu As I stated in my essay, my primary worry is the risks to vulnerable women. As everyone knows, I\u2019m no longer reliant on communal facilities, nor am I likely to be imprisoned or need a women's refuge any time soon. I\u2019m not arguing for the privileged, but the powerless. 6/9 Some emails came from professionals working in women\u2019s refuges, the prison service, the social work system, the criminal justice system and the police. All expressed concerns about the aims and methods of current trans activism. 5/9 Since writing my essay, I\u2019ve received over 3000 emails thanking me for speaking up. I\u2019ve been brought to tears many times while reading, sometimes out of gratitude for their kindness, but also because many women have shared their own experiences of violence &amp; sexual assault. 4/9 For those who\u2019d like to know what triggered the shadow minister\u2019s original accusation, these are the relevant paragraphs of the essay I wrote a couple of weeks ago. The full piece can be read here https://t.co/Vs4V1yfGkA https://t.co/6H90WZfqPG This morning, Mr Russell-Moyle issued an apology on Twitter, although he didn\u2019t trouble to tag me in. Coincidentally, his change of heart occurred after his remarks were repeated in national newspapers with higher circulations than @tribunemagazine. 2/9 Today I discovered that I was accused of hate by shadow environment minister Lloyd Russell-Moyle in the pages of @tribunemagazine. He claimed I was \u2018using\u2019 my experiences of sexual assault and domestic violence to \u2018discriminate\u2019 against trans people. 1/9 I love this gorgeous peacock! It looks so cheerful! \ud83e\udd9a\ud83d\udc95 #TheIckabog https://t.co/PBqUYP8ioK Holly, I can\u2019t tell you how much I love your picture of a sad and lonely Ickabog watching the humans! I especially love your theory about the Ickabog - you\u2019ll need to keep reading to find out whether it\u2019s true! #TheIckabog https://t.co/U3eUYtbPLd Jonas, I LOVE this picture of Lord Spittleworth pondering his next move! His shifty expression, the detail on his costume, the jewelled cup and the way you\u2019ve framed him in the doorway are all wonderful! #TheIckabog https://t.co/3A204bEKUZ That makes me so happy. There might be another gasp moment before we\u2019re through! https://t.co/xifX2Nqj9H This is a wonderful picture of poor Captain Beamish\u2019s body on his horse, Caitlyn! \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/fzqpdFPIRh Keerthi, this is a spectacular drawing! You\u2019ve made a proper chimera, a monster composed of different creatures, and the background is so beautiful and evocative! #TheIckabog https://t.co/WiUeOKHNOY Isabella, I hope everyone opens up this picture to look at it, because it\u2019s so good! A beautifully drawn dragonish Ickabog trotting through the marsh - I love it! #TheIckabog https://t.co/v4eWq8zD3a Thadar Shin Thant Zaw, these pictures are all MAGNIFICENT! You\u2019re so talented! It\u2019s very hard to choose a favourite, but I think your drawing of Cornucopian produce is one of the very best I\u2019ve seen! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f #TheIckabog https://t.co/8dDL9NMFUR Eilidh, what a fabulous Ickabog! I love its ears, its fierce expression and the way it\u2019s spitting both venom and fire! I also love how you\u2019ve depicted it emerging out of darkness! #TheIckabog https://t.co/9RYzJFbmIr Jordyn, this picture of Ma Grunter is EXCELLENT! Her clothes are so beautifully drawn and she looks exactly as cruel as she should! I also love the wart on her nose! #TheIckabog https://t.co/RUOG0WtOpU Happy birthday to yooooou! \ud83c\udf82\ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udd42 https://t.co/6aG0HnWz8p @sool47 \u2764\ufe0f SPOILER ALERT IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T READ TODAY'S CHAPTERS - This is the first picture I've seen of the Ickabog holding the children, Marina, and I love it!

It's so well-drawn and detailed I just spent several minutes looking closely at it! Wonderful work! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/X6WrrmWNpi Easily the scariest and one of the most brilliant Ma Grunters I've seen! Fantastic work! #TheIckabog https://t.co/FB8ehZmc5Q @adityaanupkumar There's nothing unreasonable about that. One of those a day would definitely keep my dementors at bay...

Aoife, this is a SPLENDID picture of King Fred outside his gorgeous castle! You've coloured it all so beautifully and made Fred look so loveable I can quite see why nobody could believe any ill of him! #TheIckabog https://t.co/F6JKz9cOBA Ah, this is the first Ickabog tax collector I've seen and this is EXACTLY how I imagined the backs of their uniforms! I love all the detail - the money clutched in his hands and that very knotty tree, not to mention the raven that's landed beside him! #TheIckabog https://t.co/rXb81MV6MO I never thought of Spittleworth as pimply, but I see you imagine him differently, and it works! I love his fierce expression and his curled moustache - a true villain! #TheIckabog https://t.co/frQ51jxAwV Well, this just made my whole week! I absolutely love your picture, your description of what it shows and your excitement about the rest of the story - this is why I love writing for your age group!

I especially like how he's looking downwards, not into the viewer's eye! #TheIckabog https://t.co/BIyXM2HqPK RT @TheIckabog: More incredible illustrations were submitted this week for #TheIckabog. Here are a few from this week's themes, we wish we\u2026 Two MAGNIFICENT Ickabogs, Anya and Katya! I love the luminous eyes on both, the creepy shape and fangs of the brown monster and the fabulous multicoloured scales of spike-tailed one! #TheIckabog https://t.co/vsiOO5llFl I love this tiny medal, James! Really beautiful work! #TheIckabog https://t.co/VyqTqT35F2 Isla-Rose, this is a WONDERFUL picture of poor Mr Dovetail! You\u2019ve captured all his exhaustion and sadness, put in so much detail and that little bit of wood with the carved heart and daisy is perfect and heartbreaking \ud83d\udc94 \ud83c\udf3c#TheIckabog https://t.co/CBp6Clf4bh Ihita, this is SUCH a good and powerful picture! You\u2019ve made poor Mr Dovetail look so small and alone in the surrounding darkness. Sad as it is, I love it! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/wdC3WmWUbh Keerthana, this is easily the most imaginative, weirdest (and I mean that in a good way!) Ickabog I\u2019ve seen! It looks part-monster, part-machine! I especially love the tiny sheep in the gaping mouth! #TheIckabog https://t.co/cejdtEcc85 Srijoni, these roses are so good I can almost smell them! I hope everyone opens up the picture to see the whole thing - beautiful! #TheIckabog https://t.co/IWG0FTdKWi Welcome to the writing life, Emily, and I LOVE your beautiful drawings! Your wolfish Ickabog looks rather sweet and that peacock is gorgeous! #TheIckabog https://t.co/9hIeye712I Megan, these are fantastic! I love the colourful roof on Brenda\u2019s butchers, all the wonderfully detailed food and drink (and I want to know why nobody\u2019s ever told me about wine libraries - what a splendid idea...) #TheIckabog https://t.co/aRQ7ZBdSUu Bhagyashree, this is simply incredible! So much colour and detail, but above all, a wardrobe full of her mother\u2019s love \ud83d\udc94 \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f #TheIckabog https://t.co/4pi44qzSR1 Zaynab, I love all the details you\u2019ve got in here: the swords, shield and helmet on the wall, Bert looking hopeful and Flapoon looking mean! #TheIckabog https://t.co/qLbRLJRxhk Harriet, your Lady Eslanda looks so pretty and kind!

I love the picture of Bert - you can see how nobody recognised him, because he looked so clean and neat in his picture - and I like the parchment effect you\u2019ve given the background! #TheIckabog https://t.co/zpDevxYG0f This is a GORGEOUS picture! The palace looks magnificent - no wonder Fred and his two friends look so happy to live there! \ud83d\udc96 #TheIckabog https://t.co/ghcBkuzMMe Jana, these are all wonderful! It\u2019s hard to choose, because I love the roses and Ma Grunter, but I think I like Daisy and your dragonish Ickabog best! #TheIckabog https://t.co/yXy1ZFfMQt Mariia, I absolutely LOVE this beautifully drawn picture of clever Bert concealing himself one the vegetable patch! I hope everyone opens it up to get the full effect! #TheIckabog https://t.co/o3oV4kMM8I Samson, this is an AMAZING Spittleworth! He looks so sinister with the his long, spindly arms and that mean expression - wonderful detail on his clothing, too! #TheIckabog https://t.co/sTptex56Kw A FANTASTIC picture showing Mrs Beamish in all her power! I love how she dominates the situation even though she\u2019s in shadow! #TheIckabog https://t.co/d8DtBY1ho5 Janaki, I completely agree - Lord Spittleworth would definitely think himself too important for a plain candlestick! A really beautiful drawing focusing on detail and colour - bravo! #TheIckabog https://t.co/NT99iI509Z Annika, I LOVE these pastries and I especially love the ones you invented yourself! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/PBdI74dlLm Wow, I think your niece is well on her way to her ambition!

You\u2019ve got so much amazing detail in here, and Hetty\u2019s attitude is perfect! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/NIFH9T1lGZ If children reading #TheIckabog would like to draw more pictures, we\u2019re lacking illustrations of the sinister Lord Spittleworth with his candle and of noble Captain Goodfellow! I love Mrs Beamish\u2019s long hair and the moon at the window, Gabriella - a last moment of calm before the truth hits her! #TheIckabog https://t.co/S1V4ymeJHs What a stunning picture, Rylie - I\u2019d hang this on my wall! (Also, ten?! Is that possible?) \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/jq64UC3HI5 Amanda, this is an extraordinarily good picture and very clever! I love the sharp focus on the wine and Fred\u2019s arm and the way the crowd all look the same from his point of view! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/kE0r1SVshw I love both of these, Leah! Poor Mrs Beamish looks both loveable and scared, as she should, and that\u2019s a beautiful rose garden! #TheIckabog https://t.co/oKAj9nvnSd Wow, Rudra, I love these! They\u2019re all wonderful - Fred in his black suit is perfect - but that picture of the palace courtyard is one of the best I\u2019ve seen! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/eRR3SW6RmP Betsie, I hereby swear allegiance to my new monarch. \ud83d\udc51 \ud83d\udc95 #TheIckabog https://t.co/UdbzZYAXmp Stunning work, Y6! A splendid warrior king, two FABULOUS Ickabogs and a gorgeous picture of the City-Within-The-City! #TheIckabog https://t.co/ENT2QGKKFL Why is this one of my favourite pictures so far? I think because it makes the monster look disconnected from the world, a creature of imagination, but also because it\u2019s chasing its own tail. Highly symbolic! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f #TheIckabog https://t.co/bbHA7tw8cr Orson, this picture of Lord Flapoon makes him both funny and monstrous, which is exactly right! I\u2019ve got a feeling you\u2019re going to end up doing satirical cartoons for a living! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/P4ZCdd267c Phoebe, I love your rainbow peacock so much! It\u2019s a wonderful drawing and just looking at it makes me smile! #TheIckabog https://t.co/TbNq3ftNtH Zoe, this is such a clever picture, because you\u2019ve made the monster look like a dressed-up human and scared of people, rather than the other way around! Wonderful work! #TheIckabog https://t.co/L98QLI4BeS Sorley, your Ickabog\u2019s wonderful and terrifying - I love the bat wings! Cadhla, your ladies are stunning and I love the hats thrown in the air! #TheIckabog https://t.co/GKp5VzC5kG Tristan, this is a FABULOUS Ickabog and an amazing drawing! I love the monster\u2019s crocodile-ish head and teeth and the way you\u2019ve depicted the marsh! And you\u2019re 10 years old?! \ud83d\ude32 #TheIckabog https://t.co/SptV4gbsMf Rubab, I love this spectacular jewelled sword! No wonder Fred was sorry to lose it! #TheIckabog https://t.co/HYFRUGLDyO Evie, this is a magnificent drawing! All three characters are perfect, I love their clothes and the texture you\u2019ve got in the background! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/C9jJ2yspDo Ethan, I love your King Fred! He looks very pleased with himself and his clothes are fabulous! (And thank you, mum \u2764\ufe0f) #TheIckabog https://t.co/sN4r1qgl0n These are amazing! I love the fireworks in Mirabelle\u2019s picture and that gorgeous palace! And Olivia, that\u2019s one of my favourite flags: beautifully drawn! #TheIckabog https://t.co/pyHmJiRxei This makes me so sad for Patch, Eloise - I think it\u2019s the wagging tail! A wonderful drawing! #TheIckabog https://t.co/wJ1p8ReXln Bhargavi, this is STUPENDOUS! A beautiful drawing of a once happy, peaceful land  - I love it! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/e6qN01CBX2 I love this picture of Daisy in her bedroom, Maggie! All the details are wonderful, but my favourite thing is the way you\u2019ve made her mother\u2019s grave and the moon seem to be entering the room - very moving! \ud83d\udc94 #TheIckabog https://t.co/Oo4GHh4cEA Emad, this is one of my very favourite Ma Grunters! (Are you REALLY six?) She looks mean and tough, just as she should, and I also love the gloomy background and poor Daisy in the mail sack! #TheIckabog https://t.co/D1VIyK6vJp A beautiful Lady Eslanda creeping down the spiral stair! Manya, I love how you\u2019ve drawn her worried expression, gorgeous gown and the glowing lantern! #TheIckabog https://t.co/4VrT7ArRkl Lucia, this is wonderful! It really does look like an ancient map! I love the compass and the food detail you\u2019ve put in each region! #TheIckabog https://t.co/wtY3VW3UJQ RT @carolynharris24: \u00a3900,000 to put a flag on the Prime Minister's plane.\n\nThat could pay for 60,000 free school meal vouchers. \nhttps://t\u2026 @TomMusgrove11 That isn't possible. I was carrying you about half an hour ago. @TomMusgrove11 Yes, and I remember holding you when you were a baby! Give my love to the family! Latest Ickabog chapters available here:\n\nhttps://t.co/afFEfRQQ5C @MsMarmitelover My thoughts exactly! I absolutely love the way you've drawn this, Sophie, with the poor shepherd facing us, while we see only the backs of those intimidating thrones! A wonderful illustration of powerlessness meeting power! #TheIckabog https://t.co/rX3WobAYrX Mirai, this is not only a fantastic picture, it also made me feel hungry! You've drawn the fondu so beautifully, with those candles keeping the fondu warm and all the bits of fruit! #TheIckabog https://t.co/unbto3WKjb Anmol, these are both WONDERFUL! I love sweet King Fred standing in front of his palace - you've made him look very innocent, which he is, in some ways! And that multi-coloured Ickabog with the blue hair and crooked teeth is strangely adorable! #TheIckabog https://t.co/g4kQbGP2bl Look at this GORGEOUS picture of the vain King Fred holding his hand mirror, positioned by a bust of himself and a painting of himself! Ruby, this isn't only beautifully drawn, its very funny and clever! #TheIckabog https://t.co/kCd2ZYzl95 Sifat, what a BEAUTIFUL painting of the Ickabog, complete with lightning bolt tail and wings like stained glass! I love the marshy background, too! Also, are you really 6, because that's very hard to believe?! #TheIckabog https://t.co/7ni797QkDi You should be super proud, William! A fabulous drawing of the faked Ickabog attack on the Tenderloins' house, with the giant Ickabog foot, the smashed fence and that grim-faced soldier! I love it! #TheIckabog https://t.co/4XYDWybF8B This superb drawing looks as though it came from the pages of an old bestiary! Pratyusha, I love the terrifying head, the horns and spikes and that triple-ended tail! \n\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/TylK31iKUW Arjun, this dark, fanged monster is truly creepy with its snake tail and fangs, yet weirdly cute! I'd be terrified seeing those scarlet-pupilled eyes shining at me through the mist but I can't help liking the way it's sitting, like a dog! A really wonderful picture! #TheIckabog https://t.co/76tCkmHWt9 MJ, you're so talented! This is a PERFECT picture of the scroll Professor Fraudyshame showed King Fred! You've made an amazing Ickabog here - I love the black scales and the wide scarlet wings - it looks like a heraldic beast! #TheIckabog https://t.co/et4NW5jP6U Could there be a more appropriate medium for depicting the Ickabog than biscuits? Meghan, I absolutely love these and hope they tasted as good as Hopes-of-Heaven!\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/BDTBjW7jnt This is a spectacular picture of the men stuck on the marsh, Prajit! People REALLY need to open up this picture to appreciate how good it is! I love those trees, the poor trapped Patch and the surprise in the sky! #TheIckabog https://t.co/DHevcqvL94 Seriously, how can you be only 7, Vedant? This is a BRILLIANT drawing of the Ickabog, with its wolf head, dragon wings and snake's body! You've got so much atmosphere onto your murky marsh, too! #TheIckabog https://t.co/QCJna2yrv1 Dunamis, this Ickabog is WONDERFUL and so clever - it looks as though it's got attachments for different enemies - extra snake heads shooting venom as well as fire breath and three different tails! I also love the terrified little king!\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/MQoYOfkaNJ OK, this is simply too good. Elinor, you don't fool me, you're an award-winning professional illustrator trying to sneak into the competition by pretending to be eleven years old. The skill and imagination displayed here are BREATHTAKING.\n\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f#TheIckabog https://t.co/FT8o4C03AU A magnificent Bogahog! Judging by this specimen, the Bogahog is huge, fierce and resembles a winged bear! Thank you for bringing this subspecies to my attention, Samson, and I love the picture! #TheIckabog https://t.co/oxRdvrGDeG This is a beautiful picture, Amanda, though heartbreaking! I really love your Daisy, who looks just as I imagine her. You've made her little house truly fantastical with those wonderful windows, and that melancholy sky reflects poor Daisy's mood - as it should! \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/TdgwzrSrtK Kenisha, these are all FABULOUS! You've got so much clever detail into these pictures! I love the map and the gorgeous courtyard, with Bert and Daisy and the statues, but I think my favourite is the carpenter's workshop! It feels so warm and friendly! #TheIckabog https://t.co/dOGIWUGmjh Alina, I don't think I've got enough superlatives left to express how good this picture is! Are you absolutely, positively sure you're thirteen? I hope everyone opens it up to see one of the very best pictures I've been sent! With love from Mama Ro \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f#TheIckabog https://t.co/DISjL7CSeF Rishabh, this is a wonderful drawing! Spittleworth looks so spiteful, greedy and pleased with himself - perfect!\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/O9UXZC7swD Amelia, this is a simply INCREDIBLE picture of the girl who was wearing Daisy's old dress! If somebody had told me a professional illustrator had done this, I'd have believed them! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f #TheIckabog https://t.co/vJpib6LFty Promise Cho, I can't believe you're only six, because this drawing is full of emotion and I absolutely love it! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc94#TheIckabog https://t.co/tz8cfR808y Sophie, this is my very favourite of all the old shepherds I've seen! The poor man looks so travel-worn and sad, and you've captured him in exactly the right attitude as he kneels before the king. A wonderful drawing! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f#TheIckabog https://t.co/fXm2xOnXQQ Jill, this is such a wonderful picture I'm slightly lost for words... are you absolutely sure you're not a professional illustrator?! From her expression to her beautiful clothes, a stunning piece of art! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f #TheIckabog https://t.co/24vkwMB4oJ Harry, this is a STUNNING drawing of King Fred and I love it! The detail on his clothes and the expression on his face are so well done - this is some serious talent! #TheIckabog https://t.co/o9VWmajETa Joseph, this Ickabog is SPECTACULAR! It looks truly fierce! I love the blank, staring eyes, the fiery breath, the horns, the fangs and those snaky protuberances! I can tell how hard you worked, because this is an excellent drawing! \n\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f#TheIckabog https://t.co/wWe0035B1H Seven years old?! How is that possible, Indrashis? This is a MAGNIFICENT portrait of Ma Grunter! You've made her look so mean and fierce (I love those crooked teeth!) and dressed her exactly as I imagine her! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/rfZdifHZlR This is a WONDERFUL Ickabog, Rose! He really does look as though he's covered in marsh weed and I love the blackened fangs, the bloody claws and the strangely mismatched eyes! Spooky and strange, just as the monster should be! #TheIckabog https://t.co/J0IWVDvWQV Charlotte, this is a MARVELLOUS picture and one of my favourites! Your monster is totally original, with its flaming tail and long neck (another true chimaera!) and I LOVE the sheep stuck up in that beautifully drawn tree! \n\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f #TheIckabog https://t.co/ouhAs18rWn Ian, I hope everyone opens up this fabulous drawing to see King Fred fiddling nervously with the tassel on his curtain!

From the shine on the bottle to the detail on the label, I feel as though I could reach out and touch this Jeroboam champagne! #TheIckabog https://t.co/hEjjMlybn1 Nicholas, I couldn't love this drawing of the palace more! Not only is it a magnificent picture, it's highly symbolic: 3 interconnected palaces for the king and the two men who're really running the country: Spittleworth and Flapoon! #TheIckabog https://t.co/TeZ8Dd4zar A WONDERFUL King Fred, Gabriella! His stance looks truly regal and I love his hair and moustache! You've succeeded in capturing an attitude in what looks like a simple drawing - bravo! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/nAmeudS80c Anita, this is a SUPERB Ickabog! I love the gorgeous colours, the beautiful eyes and the forked tongue - you really wouldn't know whether to admire this monster or run from #TheIckabog https://t.co/JzolJjlIyh What an BEAUTIFUL, skilful drawing. A panoramic view of the story so far, with many different scenes and locations! I love everything, especially the statue of Nobby Buttons, all the characters and the cabbage being thrown at the three honest soldiers! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Sfpq9V0aje Daniel, I spent ages looking at all these, because they're absolutely wonderful! I LOVE your humorous, cartoony style. You've really captured character and emotion in these drawings, right down to Fred's slightly bored horse! #TheIckabog https://t.co/ZMSaR9qd6Q Ada, your Ickabog is wonderful! I love the devilish moustache and the bright red eyes! He's both scary and funny and I love the catlike ears, too! #TheIckabog https://t.co/wnmPQMGTyR An absolutely STUNNING drawing and one of the very best peacocks I've seen! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f #TheIckabog https://t.co/H4jyhtQyOZ I can honestly say that this is one of my favourite Ickabogs so far!

I love her sweet smile, the glowing light and the beautifully drawn stonework! #TheIckabog https://t.co/FojZitU8mM Two remarkable descriptions and drawings! The monsters are so different, yet both combine elements of the myths about the Ickabog! I love the three spiked tails and lizards looks of the red one and the two-headed, horn backed snake! \ud83d\udc4f\u2665\ufe0f#TheIckabog https://t.co/5mNXRyLoZ3 These pictures are wonderful! One of the most terrifying Ickabogs I've seen - he looks as though he's naturally armoured and I love his creepy single eye - and a pair of beautiful peacocks! Well done Class 8! #TheIckabog https://t.co/QzipNvVkFI Viviana, I LOVE the design of these gold ducats! King Fred's handsome head on one side and a true Cornucopia on the other - fabulous! #TheIckabog https://t.co/M4qKPAEeFb Aria, this drawing of the Widow Buttons is PERFECT and I can't believe you're only 7! I love everything from the big red wig to the black dress to the overblown misery! #TheIckabog https://t.co/59SrpXSEYU Saoirse, this is by far the best cow I've ever been given and it's the best cow drawing by a 3-year-old I've ever seen \u2665\ufe0f\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/9tKvGDDsgF Violet, you aren't really, really only seven, are you? Because this is one of the very best peacocks I've seen! \n\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f #TheIckabog https://t.co/tNn44SsWqM Sofia, these are STUNNING!

You've also made them all loveable, as they should be! #TheIckabog https://t.co/KeQKj6IZBq Dev, I love your fire-breathing Ickabog! He looks so triumphant, standing there with wings outstretched on the marsh! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Yht9H0Hv2s Wow, Juan David! This is an AMAZING drawing! You've combined the dragonish and wolf-like aspects of the legend to make something both scary and beautiful! #TheIckabog https://t.co/sx83ZnMC9e Owen, your Ickabog is wonderful and totally original! I love how you've given it two heads and two feet so it cartwheels along! It would be so creepy to see this moving along the marsh, not knowing quite what it was until you saw those scarlet-stained fangs! #TheIckabog https://t.co/kLdsy58ULT I really love this drawing of Jeroboam champagne! Both the extravagant design of the bottle and that gorgeous jewelled goblet seem typically Cornucopian to me! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Y9DXbLcYn8 Petra, this is perfect! You've told a little story with this picture: of Flapoon's self-satisfied nature and of the poor, sad horse sagging beneath him! I love the way you've done the sky, the rippling grass and the high castle wall, too!\n\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/cwgKdWIYrJ Angus, I love these! Your boorish King Fred looks as though he'd be very bad company and your shape-shifting giant amoeba of an Ickabog is very strange and clever - it looks as though it would be perfectly at home on the marsh!\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/G6EV3RxXa2 I just... what? \nHOW CAN YOU BE ONLY 10, SADIE? \nThis is a simply astonishing picture! A genuinely terrifying monster, straight out of a horrible nightmare and so beautifully drawn! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f #TheIckabog https://t.co/GmvIUklTNV Casey, this is a FABULOUS picture of Professor Fraudysham in his thick glasses and silver wig!

I'd have been able to tell who was who even if Flapoon's tummy wasn't rumbling! I especially like Spittleworth's skinny white legs and the small, scared petitioner! #TheIckabog https://t.co/0yXigBx410 Arohi, I love this picture of Fred! His costume is perfect and I love all the food and wine you've put around his feet! He also looks handsome but foolish, which is exactly right! #TheIckabog https://t.co/nDaLDtRZcV THESE ARE FANTASTIC, MYRA! You're so talented! Look at the cakes, the sheep and that exceptionally cute Ickabog! I'm ashamed to say I'd never heard of quilling before, so I've learned something new today, as well! #TheIckabog https://t.co/BpJG1dLm7w I would definitely be very scared if I came across this Ickabog on the marsh, Jemima, even though he's a tiny bit cute, too! I love the bloody, fanged hole of a mouth, the staring yellow eyes and the marsh green skin, all the better for camouflaging himself! #TheIckabog https://t.co/PRDfvYloKZ Ah, this is the first picture of Martha I've seen and I love her, Melissa! The reflection in the mirror is beautifully done and so are the mattresses all lined up on the floor! #TheIckabog https://t.co/SIxE8r3VDQ William, this picture of the blood and feathers left after the attack on Tubby's house really does convey the nastiness of what Spittleworth's doing! #TheIckabog https://t.co/oWnEB7uEcZ Bertie, this picture of Ma Grunter is perfect! She looks exactly as mean and cruel as she should! I also love the detail of the wine bottles in the background! #TheIckabog https://t.co/6uEnystWXc I love this picture of Herringbone, Kian! He looks kind and wise, exactly as he should, and that sideways look is perfect, as though he's watching Fred, Spittleworth and Flapoon do something foolish out of the corner of his eye!\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/ZgPldUKG1R Adits, this picture of Fred's medal is SUPERB! I love the stylised Ickabog curling around the medal and the king's slightly bored expression, as though he kills Ickabogs every day! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f #TheIckabog https://t.co/iYpgu8uf3E Mariia, these are INCREDIBLE! Can it really, honestly be true that you're only 10 years old? They're all extraordinary and it's extremely difficult to choose a favourite, but if I had to, it would be Patch chasing the marshteazle while the Ickabog watches! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f #TheIckabog https://t.co/78KaRCCYOP Maggie, these are gorgeous! I love all the detail on Lady Eslanda's splendid dress and her serious expression. I also love your strangely cute, sharp-eared and fanged wolfish Ickabog! #TheIckabog https://t.co/9u0NPKCzxA These beautiful horses are so well-drawn, as is the sad sight of Major Beamish's body draped over his steel grey stallion \ud83d\udc94#TheIckabog https://t.co/hNDp8f45kU Saira, this is one of the very best Lady Eslanda's I've seen! She looks exactly as beautiful and serious as she should and I love the lantern and the staircase down which she crept to try and save Goodfellow's life - wonderful! \n\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f #TheIckabog https://t.co/Hn7lOJL2YW Ali, this is a SUPERB drawing of the statue of Nobby Buttons! He really does look brave and resolute, just as he should, and I love the detail you've put on the plinth, with that picture of the deadly Ickabog! #TheIckabog https://t.co/mrlFFvz3CS Pratulya, this is such a wonderful (but very sad) picture! I love Ma Grunter's mean expression and the children's tears - you've got a lot of emotion in here!

You've got so much atmosphere into the picture, with the king and poor dead Major Beamish riding into the sunset! Love those horses, too! #TheIckabog https://t.co/w9RWbAsjPt Belle, this is a FABULOUS picture of the rumours spreading from person to person in Cornucopia!

We used to be comr\u2026 I respect every trans person\u2019s right to live any way that feels authentic and comfortable to them. I\u2019d march with you if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans. At the same time, my life has been shaped by being female. I do not believe it\u2019s hateful to say so. The idea that women like me, who\u2019ve been empathetic to trans people for decades, feeling kinship because they\u2019re vulnerable in the same way as women - ie, to male violence - \u2018hate\u2019 trans people because they think sex is real and has lived consequences - is a nonsense. \u2018Feminazi\u2019, \u2018TERF\u2019, \u2018bitch\u2019, \u2018witch\u2019. \nTimes change.

If sex isn\u2019t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives.

Elly, I love your Ickabog with the flame in its single eye, the blood-stained fangs and the tentacles and I love that you've got it surrounded by mysterious darkness and dreaming of nightfall! #TheIckabog https://t.co/4BnKHlWeaA This is so good, Evelyn!

The empty bottles are perfect, too! #TheIckabog https://t.co/iIx1BlFTx3 Isabelle, this is such a splendid palace and I love that you've made golden-haired King Fred and his horse so small by comparison - it shows the power of a king, but also that he's just a man like everyone else!

I think you've even researched what the royal guards look like in London!

Sudha, I love everything: the food, the paintings on the walls, the golden chandelier and the sense of grandeur you've given the scene! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f#TheIckabog https://t.co/OVKRbUA9Go Sophie, this is wonderful!

Truly marvellous! #TheIckabog https://t.co/0eoC7j3e9W Sarabel, how can you be only 9 years old??? This is one of my favourite King Freds so far! It's an INCREDIBLE painting and really does show the king as a handsome pop star-ish figure!

I  love Fred's outfit, the detail on the ceiling and the painting of himself beside him! #TheIckabog https://t.co/MGhDinB1Qz Ava, this is a SUPERB drawing! It really does look like a chimera, a monster that's a mixture of other beasts! You're a very talented artist! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f#TheIckabog https://t.co/iNfw96MRNY The Sarthak Foundation's extraordinary record continues with this SUPERB picture from Ayushi!

I love Fred looking like a swamp creature as he cowers beside his dropped sword! Also love your devilish Ickabog with the lamp-like eyes cavorting in the fog! #TheIckabog https://t.co/pbrmlaLtNJ Selina, this is WONDERFUL! Fred in his purple suit looking both immaculate and slightly absurd (as he should)! The detail on his clothes and the slightly silly, self-satisfied look you've put on his face are perfect! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/ug092kOMAs Jessica, this is one of my very favourite pictures! A beautiful painting of Fred, Spittleworth and Flapoon riding into Jeroboam through the crowds - you've put so much energy and detail in here! \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f#TheIckabog https://t.co/l7tYXKXiEx Vicky, I love this beautifully drawn picture of the key to the cellar where poor Major Beamish's body lies! A very symbolic image - the door hiding the truth and the key about to disappear into Spittleworth's pocket! #TheIckabog https://t.co/dEGKgJDxTG I love your Ickabog, Danah! It reminds me of a cross between a multicoloured Afghan hound and a pony, except for that long curled tongue, which I'm guessing is poisonous, and those huge eyes! I wouldn't know whether to run away or stay and hug it \u2764\ufe0f #TheIckabog https://t.co/roTlCApHTe Alya, this is one of my favourite Ickabogs so far! A really amazing picture - love the hair, the crazy red eyes, the wings and that wolfish tail! #TheIckabog https://t.co/uB3jOtncRF A magnificent map, Rudra, with so much amazing detail in it! I love it! #TheIckabog https://t.co/k78SHkhUJa Gemma, these pictures are WONDERFUL! You've got so much emotion in here! I love Bert leaning on poor Mrs Beamish and you've drawn one of my very favourite Lady Eslandas so far - she looks just as I imagine her, sneaking downstairs in the dark with her lantern! #TheIckabog https://t.co/hO5d7AcfHS Yojith, I didn't expect the philosopher's stone to turn up in King Fred's sword - what a plot twist! This is an incredible picture. I love the jewelled hilt and golden blade! #TheIckabog https://t.co/VO7HF9bbJq Angela, I love your slime monster and I totally agree with the sign in his hand - I also love the close up of those scary, lamblike eyes. You two are very talented! #TheIckabog https://t.co/uag9xJDhEN Best thing I could hear and I LOVE these beautiful sketches, which have real feeling in them, Sam! Love the slightly scared-looking Ickabog, that gorgeous peacock, the king looking handsome &amp; pleased with himself and sad Daisy taking flowers to the grave. Wonderful \u2764\ufe0f#TheIckabog https://t.co/Y9Qjtxor6s This is an AMAZING drawing, Akshaj! I love everything - the long, clawed fingers, the vibrant wings, dragonish head, forked tail and wolf-like feet - and is that a turnip it's reaching for? Interesting - a vegetarian Ickabog! #TheIckabog https://t.co/TPnSKI1FCt Joshua, this is a wonderful picture of a very scary ickabog! He's so tall, he looks like a rearing snake, but those long spindly arms are really creepy! I definitely wouldn't want to meet him on a foggy night! #TheIckabog https://t.co/VHml38Q4Yf A stunning Lady Eslanda, Rosa! Her dress is absolutely magnificent and I love the bible hanging from her belt - you've really made her serious and bookish, as she should be! #TheIckabog https://t.co/ptaKVkX6jV Lee, I love your picture! You've got so much detail in here: Bert's monstrous nightmare, his teddy bear and all the things in his bedroom (the stickers on his drawers!) but I think my favourite thing is the neighbour peeking through the window! #TheIckabog https://t.co/ONuQ4r2BrQ These are all incredible! Beautiful work, Y4/5/6! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/eFIBKaZfkk This is such a spectacular flag, R! A really accomplished drawing - I love the way the crown is sandwiched between the two beautifully drawn pastries! #TheIckabog https://t.co/T9YKxDHRx3 This is a superb drawing and I love your rainbow Ickabog with all his orange legs and his scary eyes and fangs! I can't imagine what you'll be able to paint when you're older if you can already do this at four! #TheIckabog https://t.co/obCt6XcPa4 WOW! This is an absolutely MAGNIFICENT picture of King Fred's jewelled sword, Ashna - you're really talented! I also love the detail on King Fred's sleeve - is that an evil eye repellant?

I think it might be the cutest Ickabog I've seen so far and I want to pat it on the head! Love the stripes and the poison arrows! #TheIckabog https://t.co/53nNiTxutG Vani, I love this picture! Putting the Marshland huts in the foreground and the castles away in the far distance expresses something very important about Cornucopia and about the way you related to the story! \ud83d\udc4f#TheIckabog https://t.co/kApc5HunKk Layla, this is a wonderful picture of the Ickabog close up! I really like its green-blue colour (good camouflage on the marsh), its staring, lamp-like eyes and all those jagged fangs! #TheIckabog https://t.co/V767kVc6NE Suryan, I LOVE your beaming King Fred, who looks as though he's juggling a rainbow - a perfect way of showing the country's happiness when he became king! I also love his palace! (And you can't be late to a story, that's one of the great things about them!) #TheIckabog https://t.co/rwsFQHE1Tf Summer, your Ickabog is wonderful! You've incorporated all the bits of the different legends and I particularly like the big, staring bloodshot eyes and the snake tail! \u2764\ufe0f#TheIckabog https://t.co/4rGuv6CeZy Abdur Rahman, this is a FABULOUS picture and I can't believe you're only 4! I love all the different coloured legs, the five eyes and the big mouth - very scary and very imaginative! #TheIckabog https://t.co/5UxBilcNYA I love this Ickabog! His staring orange eyes, the golden wings and the green legs are definitely monster-like, but why do I still find him a bit cute? I think it's the size of his head! #TheIckabog https://t.co/KjLLymMuY6 Desirae, I absolutely love your ickabog! You've taken all the elements of the legends about the monster and put them together to create something creepy and strange, which is exactly how it should be! #TheIckabog https://t.co/fkpHIalFvO Hayden, these are amazing! If this is what you can do when you try then you should definitely keep at it! I love all the characters, the beautiful fountain and the peacock, but my favourite is Herringbone, who looks serious but kind, exactly as he should! #TheIckabog https://t.co/NoFhxbbfWw I absolutely LOVE seeing different ideas inspired by the original story! Alyssa, your cartoon 'Dining with the Ickabog' is one of my favourite pictures so far! You've kept the wolfish head and the snaky body, but they all look so friendly with their red noses! #TheIckabog https://t.co/JET0Xg7JZc I especially love how happy Fred looks, compared to the grumpy Ickabog! All that fog swirling around gives you a good idea of how scary it must have been on the marsh that night! #TheIckabog https://t.co/DG5b0KVa69 These are all wonderful! I love that two-headed Ickabog - truly scary and a fabulous painting - your loveable King Fred and Bert's tiny medal! \ud83c\udfc5 Looking forward to seeing how Lady Eslanda turns out! #TheIckabog https://t.co/MjqgTZCMJk Aarav, this is a FANTASTIC map of Cornucopia! I love the detail you've put on here - the glass of wine, the cake and the sausage - and I love that you've put the graveyard there, too! This must have taken you a long time and it shows! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udded #TheIckabog https://t.co/YzYTAGuC0X Good ol\u2019 misogyny.

I can feel his panic as he tries to get back into his uniform! I love all the detail (especially his plumed helmet) and the rainbow colours of Major Beamish's pyjamas and bedroom! \ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08#TheIckabog https://t.co/ey7EYopOZo I absolutely LOVE this picture of Lord Flapoon!

Thank you for making me smile - I hope you enjoy the rest of the story! #TheIckabog https://t.co/qCeWosef8K This is a GORGEOUS flame-tailed peacock, Ryan! You've really captured the texture of the feathers - I love it! #TheIckabog https://t.co/l4PLEzX0mG Haley, there's so much I love about this picture - the terrified Fred with his lovely hair and the creepy one-eyed, octopus-like Ickabog who (even though he's a monster) looks as though it might be quite fun! #TheIckabog https://t.co/iGowhyMhNY Lillie, I love your illustration! This wolfish Ickabog looks as though it's secretly quite sweet, although those yellow eyes might be scary if you saw them through the fog at night! #TheIckabog https://t.co/i1IriAvgQW Oh, Leah - SUCH an incredible picture and I think the saddest one so far... \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f#TheIckabog https://t.co/ung2SVBXyO Robin, I absolutely love this Ickabog and I can hardly believe it was drawn by someone who's only four! I like his shape! His eyes are mean, but I think he looks sad - maybe he's lonely on the marsh? #TheIckabog https://t.co/3OOpNY4sFe Sophia, are you really, truly 9?! This is a FABULOUS picture of the Ickabog enjoying itself in the marsh! I love the colour (would blend well with rocks), the scales and the mixture of dragonish and snaky features! #TheIckabog https://t.co/psu4v4PsZs Oliver, I love this rainbow-coloured jewelled sword - I can totally see why King Fred was sorry to lose it and why Roach was pleased to get it! \ud83d\udc8e\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9a#TheIckabog https://t.co/CP5SXDjEPX I LOVE this picture of King Fred on his throne, with Spittleworth and Flapoon either side of him, Zac!

Fred staring off into the distance as though he\u2019s having his picture painted while Spittleworth and Flapoon look knowingly at us... perfect! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f #TheIckabog https://t.co/CBupcA5fLS Are you a secret organisation for young geniuses?!

Lovely work \u2764\ufe0f #TheIckabog https://t.co/8QlZfgbyFE Leah, your King Fred is adorable!

This is a really accomplished painting and I especially like the finny ruff and the clever way you\u2019ve made it seem as though he\u2019s really standing in water! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Dk5DecpZDK Javacia, I already know how wonderful you must be as a person &amp; as a teacher, for a parent want to pay you this tribute! This picture is everything that\u2019s good and right with the world. Great teachers send ripples way beyond their classrooms. This comes with love &amp; admiration \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/SKbttL467y I love this fierce but fuzzy Ickabog, who\u2019d blend in so well amongst boulders and marsh weed, and you\u2019ve also made me imagine just how heavy bunches of egg-sized grapes would be! \ud83c\udf47 #TheIckabog https://t.co/s76nJ31LAR Elliott, this is an AMAZING picture and it\u2019s very hard that believe you\u2019re only 5! You\u2019ve really put a lot of emotion into it and I love how you\u2019ve drawn the grave and the very sad Daisy \ud83d\udc94 #TheIckabog https://t.co/QazldKufAT Belle, this is an INCREDIBLE picture, I absolutely love it! You\u2019ve got so much energy and personality into Daisy and Mr Dovetail and the detail in the workshop is fabulous! #TheIckabog https://t.co/MLFGcm7KHB Beautiful sword, Bella! I can definitely see why Fred wanted it back! #TheIckabog https://t.co/p5eLegYyRx \u2764\ufe0f This is a gorgeous picture of The king and the two lords riding together! There\u2019s something very satisfying about that sunny landscape and the different sizes of those horses - everyone &amp; everything seems so happy! #TheIckabog https://t.co/LckU62mRt0 This is a FABULOUS picture: an Ickabog engulfed in its own flame, feet and one serpent\u2019s eye visible - and the poor human owner of that arm. Wonderful! #TheIckabog https://t.co/4mzxO4iDZr Nila, this is a magnificent and terrifying picture of the monster! I love the eyes and the scaly tail and the fact that it looks unlike any creature I\u2019ve seen before! \ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/OwveKtVzS0 Not at all - teachers are welcome to film themselves reading #TheIckabog for their classes! https://t.co/Owz8l9FnSR RT @ainnanism: Hes literally the music genius no one compares haha the ending tho \ud83e\udd23 https://t.co/5AFFQ43mR1 This is a GREAT thread pulling together loads of Black owned bookstores in the US. \n\nFor Black bookstores (and publishers) in the UK, see this excellent link https://t.co/N6ljfGb2S8 https://t.co/WyLPyMr9SF Thrilling news. It's like that moment when you realise Boo Radley's standing in the corner of the room. https://t.co/7QTEYjYX1z New chapters now available to read online!\n\nhttps://t.co/afFEfRzeH2 This government\u2019s response to demonstrations against racism is to delay a report that could save BAME lives? This is disgusting. Release the damn report. https://t.co/S0sIcUVn00 Caden, I absolutely love your magnificent Ickabog! A beautiful painting from its fearsome head to the tips of its wings and tail \ud83d\udc96 #TheIckabog https://t.co/gmzijKRYuw RT @BarackObama: I wrote out some thoughts on how to make this moment a real turning point to bring about real change\u2013\u2013and pulled together\u2026 This is real bravery and greatness of heart. God bless Terrence Floyd and his whole family. \ud83d\udc94 https://t.co/yKfN7bdOVx An incredible picture of a horned and fanged monster that looks part-insect, part horned bird! Charles, I absolutely love your Ickabog and I can tell how much hard work went into it! Those poor, scared people! #TheIckabog https://t.co/iWzEHeZqm1 Truman, this is a FABULOUS expressive picture of the Ickabog and it makes me think of a stegosaurus with its spiked back! #TheIckabog https://t.co/L7jph53Kbr Olivia, this is a gorgeous illustration of Lady Eslanda! She looks serious and beautiful, as she should, and I love her dress! #TheIckabog https://t.co/QlFYHvoWXX Wait - what?! That's never a 3-year-old's picture? That's absolutely INCREDIBLE!

I think those are five stars at the bottom of the picture, but in case they're not I'll give you some anyway \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f#TheIckabog https://t.co/FKaFc17QoO Niccolo, I always find things with lots of legs creepy, so your Ickabog would terrify me even though its face is quite nice - or is that just to fool me? \u2665\ufe0f#TheIckabog https://t.co/t32q7wtLdZ Mateaki, I would totally be fooled by your rocklike Ickabog, then get the shock of my life when it opened up its five eyes (are there more around the other side?) A really creepy Ickabog! #TheIckabog https://t.co/kJmQGOrSZW Cymbra, this really made me laugh! I absolutely love your cunning Ickabog who looks so cuddly, then reveals his true nature! Wonderful! #TheIckabog https://t.co/s4jOMFnQG7 Amelia, this is a FANTASTIC picture and I love everything about it! You're clearly a talented artist: you've combined elements from the different myths to make a beautiful but fearsome monster! #TheIckabog https://t.co/bc4P5t2gGy Zofia, I'd be terrified if I saw your monster bearing down on me, although his expression's quite sweet! There's so much detail here - his poisonous hand, his snake-like protrusion and the shaggy green hair to match the marsh weed - I love it! #TheIckabog https://t.co/PVijlB7s44 Look at this map! Utterly wonderful - you've got everything, Arlo! That's just how I imagine Cornucopia and the detail you've got into the picture is extraordinary, right down to all the livestock, the City-Within-The-City, the palace and the poor Marshlands! #TheIckabog https://t.co/RbymiYRWeo @krishnakoli21 Thank you \u2665\ufe0f @bogdanknez What's her name? Yojith, this is AMAZING! I love everything about your monster, from its bright colours (hinting at poison), its flame-breathing mouth, its fangs, its claws and - best of all - ITS MAGICAL POWER SACK! (I'd quite like one of those). #TheIckabog https://t.co/x1VPgp0Tj2 Anika, if you can draw this well at 4, I can't imagine what you're going to be able to do in a few years! And Nishka, I LOVE your drawing of the part-human marsh monster, with its scars and snakelike body - really creepy! #TheIckabog https://t.co/dXAzpQq4Cu My jaw's almost on the ground. HOW CAN YOU BE ONLY 9, REBECCA? This is absolutely magnificent! You're so talented! \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f#TheIckabog https://t.co/Pl6X8j0rTy Eliza, I'm loving your Fred the Fearless sitting at the end of that long red carpet! You've really captured how important he is - or how important he thinks he is! \u2665\ufe0f#TheIckabog https://t.co/LJ8lbGeQce Jovan, this is so atmospheric! You've made the Ickabog almost blend into the night, which is perfect for a creature about which so many different stories are told! I love the moonlight, the catlike eyes and the whole feeling of your illustration! #TheIckabog https://t.co/zTcQTcPlO4 Rowan, these are AMAZING! The Ickabog looks truly spooky and strange, as it should, and I'm LOVING King Fred galloping off hunting - that's a stunning horse you've painted, too! #TheIckabog https://t.co/DXenkj7CS2 Declan, this is a FANTASTIC drawing! You've given the gloomy cottage down by the graveyard a gothic, horror house feeling (which I'm sure is how Daisy felt about it when she arrived)! And I like the detail in the graveyard...\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/TgeTaaM2CK Lily, I love your beautiful drawing of a fairy tale Fred in front of his sugar pink castle! He looks so sweet! Harry, this is a picture FULL of energy and I think I spot and Ickabog at the top! #TheIckabog https://t.co/aBRPnEDXjR \ud83d\udc4fKing Fred on his milk white charger! I love this picture of Fred setting out on his great adventure, with the bystanders all watching him! Beautiful work! #TheIckabog https://t.co/tDvhJrXyxj These are wonderful! I love the hugeness of the mythical creature against the little towns and houses and I especially like the empty staring eyes, even thought the Ickabog looks somehow sweet and scared itself! #TheIckabog https://t.co/6WpTrMV7ay I really, really love these, Abby! Illustrations should draw you into the story and these really do! I love the mysterious Ickabog looming over poor Patch and I love the three little figures on horseback setting off on their adventures! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Ekc2kvw8BN I'm afraid we disagree, Isabella: you are very definitely good at art! This is a stunning picture of King Fred and certainly explains why people wanted to believe the best of him!\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/gocK7tnAad Another very well executed picture, Oli - I love Spittleworth's earrings and I love the cheese! #TheIckabog https://t.co/d24C2QthYg Robert, I love this extremely well-executed drawing!

You've made all three characters adorable - I hope you enjoy the rest of the story! #TheIckabog https://t.co/zCqXYsWsKb Fergus, this is an extraordinary painting, powerful and striking, just like the creature you've created! I love its spiked ruff and the fire blazing around the forked tongue! #TheIckabog https://t.co/hCuteJOEaK I love this chimeric Ickabog, it's amazing! Very creepy indeed and the eye scar is a fabulous touch! I also love that it's got a weakness! #TheIckabog #Pokemon https://t.co/SKlKxPGQPS A fantastic Fred the Fearless, Julia, with loads of personality and completely true to the description in the story! I love him! #TheIckabog https://t.co/QAgVY1r3rC Rosa, this is MAGNIFICENT and another favourite! The dresses, the peacocks, the fountain, the expressions on Bert and Daisy's faces - what a beautiful, expressive illustration \u2665\ufe0f#TheIckabog https://t.co/VXaOqWNWRx Shaked, these pictures are wonderful! I love your style of drawing - they've got truly whimsical, fairy tale quality about them! I'm also delighted to see what Fairies' Cradles look like, at last! #TheIckabog https://t.co/f1G3rVGs2u Sukhleen, your picture of Lady Eslanda is AMAZING and she looks (as she should) serious and clever, as well as beautiful! #TheIckabog https://t.co/m8VjsT2dvF A BIT scary? For those who want to be terrified, open up this picture! An absolutely INCREDIBLE drawing, Rosie, and definitely the most frightening Ickabog so far! #TheIckabog https://t.co/l1CS5BnaW8 Nova, you've done something really special with this picture! I feel as though your Ickabog doesn't mean to be scary, but knows it might need to protect itself! #TheIckabog https://t.co/L9rqrHtvUF I'd have known it was King Fred in the courtyard even without the note! A WONDERFUL picture and I love how you've got so much attitude into the way King Fred's standing! He really does look as though he thinks he's pretty amazing! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Rd8sOo6sth Abdulaziz, these are just wonderful! Everyone needs to open up that picture of Lord Flapoon if they need cheering up! And I love your happy King Fred, too - great pictures! #TheIckabog https://t.co/zFMyi8DgyJ Wow, look at this - another favourite Ickabog! Holly, this is so good, from the colours to the look on the monster's face, to its wings and claws! \ud83d\udd25#TheIckabog https://t.co/VzBL3BAPTV \u2665\ufe0fThis King Fred the Fearless made me say 'awww' when I opened up the full picture! He's gorgeous and this is a fabulous drawing! I love the clothes, his happy face - everything about him! #TheIckabog https://t.co/lYD8fNcDat I love this picture, it's FANTASTIC and I can hardly believe a 5(+) person did it! The wicked face, the claws, the wings - I'd be truly terrified to meet this Ickabog on the marsh! #TheIckabog https://t.co/W3bdimEm8X Tilly, you've captured the Ickabog splitting into two, as the legends say, and I couldn't love your picture more! Winged, fire-breathing serpents - fabulous! #TheIckabog https://t.co/5hCrmuqPaE Cara, your Ickabog is so loveable! I love its webbed feet (perfect for the marsh, of course) and that forked tongue and claws! Also really love the finny ears! #TheIckabog https://t.co/R60x1tuYnf An absolutely wonderful drawing of a truly terrifying, dragonish Ickabog! And you're 10?! The skill and imagination here is amazing! #TheIckabog https://t.co/wZ9NWY8sGd Olly, these are absolutely BRILLIANT! So funny and loveable - I think you're going to be a cartoonist! I hope everyone opens this up so they can see Lord Spittleworth! #TheIckabog https://t.co/nZMYl3A6Ci @imkrissuela It's free online at https://t.co/Oox5KGyJTe! OK, it's a VERY tough contest, but this might just be my favourite Lord Spittleworth so far! Look at that expression, his clothes and the way he's standing - unimprovable! #TheIckabog https://t.co/WnPrLVw7oe I'll never need to have another photograph taken \u2665\ufe0f https://t.co/3zli78VFLR Hiba, every single one of these is wonderful! I absolutely love your King Fred - so handsome! - and that beautiful Chouxville bakery! \ud83e\udd6e\ud83c\udf70\ud83e\udd5e #TheIckabog https://t.co/swxTy7V3Vc This picture is one of my favourites, Brodie! A really amazing design - I love how you can't really see the whole Ickabog, which makes it extra creepy! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Xhx4byjcbM Alastair, I'm so happy you're enjoying the story and I think your Ickabog is FANTASTIC! Really creepy and strange, exactly as a mythical beast should be, and that shadow adds a lot of menace to the picture! #TheIckabog https://t.co/9XVqeqozTJ Donald, your Ickabog is truly scary and I love it! Very creepy and vampire-like: a true monster! #TheIckabog https://t.co/TpfQWwLP1U \ud83d\udc4fI LOVE this picture! It's the first one that's shown me what the houses might look like, all the way up in the Marshlands, and there's something very satisfying about seeing that dragonish Ickabog swooping in to carry off a sheep! #TheIckabog https://t.co/D3n2cxrDHD People really need to open up this picture to see how fabulous it is, Malavika! I love the scale of your creepy giant monster with its dragonish head and I feel so sorry for the very cute Patch! #TheIckabog https://t.co/chA7U99iNB Oh, Edith, this is a wonderful picture of a very sad part of the story!

He looks so funny and pleased with himself - perfect! #TheIckabog https://t.co/rTPKcd5HlB \u2665\ufe0fThis picture sums up the chapters so far: a wonderful royal palace with the name of the mythical beast stretched across it, because the Fred now wants to use the Ickabog to seem truly Fearless! #TheIckabog https://t.co/ZjcLlLxU3K This is absolutely INCREDIBLE. \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\n\nDeb, I've got a feeling that you're going to be a famous artist and I'm going to one day boast that you sent me a picture for one of my stories. Everyone needs to see this one! #TheIckabog https://t.co/M4jmjcncRh Advaya, how can you possibly be only 8?! This is a SPECTACULAR picture of the dragonish Ickabog and poor Patch! I love the colours and the expression on the Ickabog's face. I hope people open up the drawing to see the shepherd, too! #TheIckabog https://t.co/aE0sNVNBKU Erin, you might say this is 'just an idea', but it's a fabulous one! Your Ickabog looks like a cousin of the Loch Ness monster and I LOVE the fish's tail, in tribute to its marshy habitat! #TheIckabog https://t.co/RcylALqtti I literally gasped when I saw you're only 10, Sabel, because this is a STUNNING picture of Lady Eslanda! You've got so such personality into the drawing - one of my very favourites so far! #TheIckabog https://t.co/gPJSkpuIzC Rayaan, I couldn't love this picture of King Fred on his horse more! He looks so sweet and happy, I can understand why the people of Cornucopia thought he was wonderful (at least at first!) #TheIckabog https://t.co/aoImFJymIs A gorgeous picture of the fight in the courtyard! I love the soft colours and the way you've drawn the children and the garden and I find it very hard to believe you're only 8! #TheIckabog https://t.co/zJQzzv2lSz Zoya, by having King Fred's suit standing up in the middle of the picture, and the sewing machine and poor Mrs Dovetail on either side, you've captured something very important about this story! It isn't just a beautifully executed drawing, it's full of feeling! #TheIckabog https://t.co/l9lGDsGYPR Sanjna, this picture of King Fred is PERFECT and one of my very favourites so far! Not only is it a really good drawing (I love his clothes) you've captured King Fred's feelings about himself exactly! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Jg9iazBDB8 A superb dragonish Ickabog from India! I especially love the shading in this picture and the design of the wings! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Tgrx0K8Dsb Umamah, I LOVE this Ickabog! Flame-throwing hands, staring green eyes and a venomous tongue - truly terrifying! #TheIckabog https://t.co/9RYC0AnT2k A magnificent picture of King Fred the Fearless, Vihaan! His crown, his sword, his purple sash: I think this is exactly the portrait King Fred would like to see of himself! #TheIckabog https://t.co/EyBKQCOQX3 A new chapter of the Ickabog is waiting for those who're reading the story!\n\nhttps://t.co/afFEfRQQ5C RT @PreetRang: White neighbours kneel down and beg their black neighbours for forgiveness on behalf of whites for years of racism. Such a b\u2026 Of course I'll keep commenting on the kids' pictures, because they deserve it! Just wanted to explain a few hours of radio silence. https://t.co/ncoIte8VZU I've paused on commenting on children's drawings because, like everyone, I've been watching what's happening in America. Anything I say feels inadequate. All I know is that the world has to change. Power structures have to change. White people have to change. #BlackLivesMatter RT @Blklivesmatter: Rest in Power, Beautiful. @BlkLivesMatter honors those we have lost to police violence. #BlackLivesMatter #JusticeforGe\u2026 RT @natemcdermott: Before Martin Luther King Jr. was murdered, nearly 75% of Americans disapproved of him. So it\u2019s pretty hard to take whit\u2026 Mayuko, I love this dynamic action scene! A gorgeous and scary Ickabog and a sheep trapped in fire: a really wonderful illustration! #TheIckabog https://t.co/9JTVaYEMvL I think this is the first Ickabog I've seen that's slimy and I absolutely love it! This monster would blend in so well on the marsh! Wonderful shape, eyes and expression! #TheIckabog https://t.co/plTu9yUlBq I love this Ickabog who somehow manages to be both slightly sinister and rather sweet! Love the shape, the horns and those clawed feet! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Yjy2jRNEOA @ValeriaLopez100 I didn't say congratulations - CONGRATULATIONS! EDIBLE ICKABOG CHARACTERS! Could anything be more appropriate?! I think I recognise all of them and my favourites are probably Fred and Bert - although I'd eat any of them, if I could! \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/wG9musqEpw Another brilliant, original interpretation of the Ickabog! I love the contrast and texture in this picture and the scaly, wolfish and snakelike features - somebody really listened to the story! #TheIckabog https://t.co/wNdPXZ4dr7 Lily, this is a fantastic, detailed drawing of a clearly ferocious marsh monster! It looks like a cross between a  giant salamander and a dragon! Love the blood dripping from the fiery mouth! #TheIckabog https://t.co/KYnU6h6xLR I absolutely love this wonderful drawing of a very loveable-looking Ickabog, not to mention the fabulous marsh you've put him in! #TheIckabog https://t.co/0exnTCkZbO @ValeriaLopez100 That's a wonderful thing to hear \u2665\ufe0fThose books got me through a lot of things and I'm so glad to know they did the same for others!

They look happy although I definitely wouldn't want to meet either of them on a dark night! #TheIckabog https://t.co/EFmLE3XXbh Henry, this is a truly magnificent Ickabog! It looks very fierce - I love the way you've positioned it - and I also love hearing your ideas about the story! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Pm0uP050Fd Two glorious pictures of Fred in his carriage, riding through Chouxville, and an extremely scary Ickabog - I love those huge black, sparkling eyes! Thank you, Zoya \u2665\ufe0f#TheIckabog https://t.co/RwGowJnPxd Claire, this is one of my favourite pictures of Cornucopian food and drink. Absolutely gorgeous and now I wonder why on earth I didn't realise that Hopes-of-Heaven would, OF COURSE, be shaped like angels! #TheIckabog https://t.co/bvH321Z2A3 I love this beautifully drawn picture of King Fred! Handsome and golden-moustached with fabulous boots! #TheIckabog https://t.co/xCqr5CBVWK Isabella, it's extremely hard to believe you're only 9 because this is AMAZING! A really striking picture, a truly scary Ickabog and I really love the setting! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Pnzdf1kOun @ellie82488941 .@ellie82488941 Wonderful picture with so much detail, Lucy! I love Fred sitting beneath his own picture, I like the happy maid and I adore Herringbone in his top hat! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Yxo2obxcjF There's something so powerful about your picture of the Quiet House, Tanvi. I think it's because you've so cleverly made the house look as though it's got a sad face, by drawing the black drapes like that! I love it #TheIckabog https://t.co/ruMaFd9Ifp A superb picture of Hopes-of-Heaven! (I imagined them as stripey, too, and I don't really know why!) #TheIckabog https://t.co/ss4yfX9DIv Ariha, this is one of my favourite pictures of all I've been sent! I love everything about it - gorgeous flag - but it's the feeling of a calm, happy place that you've conveyed so beautifully. I want to go there! #TheIckabog https://t.co/iCzlJcWL7F A glorious picture of the king in front of his truly splendid palace! Fred looks so nice here, I can see why Mrs Beamish couldn't believe any ill of him! #TheIckabog https://t.co/gFr7VTGOM8 Willow, these are WONDERFUL! These aren't just really good drawings, they show such an amazing imagination! I love all of them, but my favourite might be bottom right, which looks like a marsh yeti! #TheIckabog https://t.co/k7zbrPRTCe A perfect Daisy Dovetail, dressed in her overalls and ready to do some carpentry with her dad! A wonderful drawing and a really expressive Daisy! #TheIckabog https://t.co/iHJxPKiHOM Oh, this design for the Cornucopian flag is magnificent! A really accomplished drawing (8 years old, Olivia? That's incredible!) too. I love the bridge and the circle of wheat. Now I want to know why there aren't more cows on flags! #TheIckabog https://t.co/vHt6Zq2l2I From lockdown in Scotland to lockdown in India, I must say that these are some of the best pictures I've seen! Utterly wonderful pictures of the characters (yes, Flapoon definitely looks regal) and I LOVE the servant shooting the wasp for Fred! Beautiful! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Kziu0TuFR0 This is FABULOUS, Karthikeya! A really bold, inventive drawing and a true monster, unlike anything I've seen before! You've got allusions to the dragon and the snake AND you've made reference to the legend of the monster splitting! \u2665\ufe0f the eye on the end of the tongue! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Nd0bBdvNQ8 Amelie, this is a sensational King Fred the Fearless!

I love your pictures and I want to wish you a very happy birthday! \ud83c\udf82\ud83c\udf88 https://t.co/K4YAO3pcA9 Nefeli, I stared at this map for ages admiring everything about it!

The look on his face, the way he\u2019s standing, the frock cost, the medals - WONDERFUL job! #TheIckabog https://t.co/chW949E8Ib I love these SO MUCH! The monster\u2019s clearly changing colour to camouflage itself in marsh or against rock - perfect! #TheIckabog https://t.co/JXdRFCvO9N A truly beautiful Lady Eslanda, Shylah! I love her dress, the way you\u2019ve drawn her hair and her serious expression - completely true to the story! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Bs4E3nLpPQ Ayden, this is a fantastic dragonish Ickabog! I love the stripes - perfect camouflage in marsh weed! #TheIckabog https://t.co/uInbJxDfTz @Dangerboyshow @jormataccone \ud83d\ude02 @KassandraElaize @pixburgfan88 I love it! A really gorgeous palace fountain, I love it! \u2764\ufe0f \u26f2\ufe0f #TheIckabog https://t.co/qRusURqJxp @roland3315 DM me her address! @FionneOrlander @LennartTheLad This is so happening. I know exactly where we\u2019re meeting (I\u2019ll DM you) and you get to bring 10 people &amp; I\u2019ll being 10 people. Agreed? @SmartianFilm Seen it and it\u2019s great, but Hot Rod is \u2764\ufe0f @HannahEliz15 @thelonelyisland Seen it. @FionneOrlander Don\u2019t bloody die, we\u2019re going to have such a laugh! Stay gorgeous, gorgeous \u2764\ufe0f @FionneOrlander @LennartTheLad I love you, and when this pandemic\u2019s over, I\u2019m going to buy you so many drinks \ud83c\udf77\ud83e\udd42\ud83c\udf7e @jawaddell This! @zucker_refugee @AdrianHarrop \u2764\ufe0f @Lady_Mel86 @AdrianHarrop They absolutely are. @damomen76 @AdrianHarrop \u2764\ufe0f @AdrianHarrop \u2018Insensitive\u2019. I mean, you care, you *really* care, about Rod and Frank and Denise and Dave, but at the same time, there\u2019s a laugh out loud gag every two minutes. Exactly. https://t.co/TsCzDic118 Hot Rod is one of the best comic movies of all time. Over and out. Maggie this is just... wow! It really looks like a marshland creature that might come sneaking out of the mist. Love plants draped over it and the silvery lamp-like eyes! \n\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f #TheIckabog https://t.co/9hc9IdI0LW @stoslov That's an incredible thing to be told and I couldn't be happier to hear it xxx Mishkah and Yusra, these are some of my favourite pictures of the Chouxville bakeries. How can both of you be this good at drawing?! The detail on the cakes and the beautifully drawn characters are just what a fairytale needs! \ud83e\udd5e\ud83e\udd6e\ud83e\uddc1\ud83d\udcab #TheIckabog https://t.co/4vmint1mky Grace, I LOVE this! Such a beautiful picture and the scrolled edges make it look really old, as it should \ud83e\udded#TheIckabog https://t.co/qL0sLkhGDp Absolutely BEAUTIFUL! Look at the detail, the hanging sign and the vine climbing over the shop... I really want to go there! #TheIckabog https://t.co/bXlOLsKmWk Stella, you really listened to the story and I LOVE your Ickabog, standing there with his wings outstretched, ready to go and steal some poor sheep!\ud83d\udc0f\ud83d\udc94#TheIckabog https://t.co/goYkk4toHU Albie, I read all your notes and I think your Ickabog's simply brilliant! I can imagine it pretending to be a rock on the marsh in the mist and your idea of the talking ears is FABULOUS! #TheIckabog https://t.co/z0Iy2M64G8 I really love this, it's so whimsical! Fred beneath the wasp's nest, earning his title of 'Fearless'! The crown and the position of his legs are \u2665\ufe0f#TheIckabog https://t.co/9wB8CnZQLw We're taking Saturdays and Sundays off! Next chapter on Monday. https://t.co/8jCquWKUOG A stunning Cornucopian flag! This looks as though it belongs to a real country - and who wouldn't be proud of a flag that featured a little glass of wine? Beautiful work, Max!\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/b5S7KJkdVr I really hope everyone opens up these pictures because \ud83d\ude0d\nI love every single one of them, from the hairy black Ickabog to the flag of Cornucopia to Lady Eslanda's beautiful smile! #TheIckabog https://t.co/gixwVjDMMI The poor sheep - and yet somehow I find Katy's Ickabog really loveable! Wonderful picture! #TheIckabog https://t.co/TmS6RDRp6O I think Holland's completely right about Fred wanting a statue of himself and I absolutely LOVE her picture! It's so well-composed and beautifully executed! #TheIckabog https://t.co/idT7TTP2vG Adelianne, I love your sharky-dragonish-serpent-like Ickabog: a real monster, and one that would survive well on a marsh! That fireball's a bit terrifying, too! #TheIckabog https://t.co/65KYTfAkph Ah, you see, Charlotte, when I see this stunning suit I understand why Fred wanted it so badly! You've really listened to the story - I love the grey fur at the collar and cuffs! #TheIckabog https://t.co/w2PhPxRdCr I'm genuinely relieved I'm not the one judging the competition, because we'd end up with 200 different pictures in every edition - they're all so amazing. It will be down to the individual publishers. They'll decide what works best in their own versions of the book. https://t.co/6dooOesy09 I'm AMAZED by the skill of this picture, Ahvni! It's got everything: detail, perspective and real character in Fred's face. I love the way you've done his hair and that magnificent crown! #TheIckabog https://t.co/swpPCf9rH8 Ameya, I'm so impressed by the way you've captured these characters! Fred and Flapoon are particularly funny and I LOVE that amphibian swamp monster! #TheIckabog https://t.co/7gm8rwdOXf A wolfish winged Ickabog on the marsh - this is incredible, Leo! And as we hope to publish in Spain, you can definitely enter the competition! Keep an eye on publishers' websites for more details! #TheIckabog https://t.co/pR8iA4g5MF Kasey, this is such a gorgeous, accomplished drawing! I love all the dresses and the crowning touch are those overalls, hanging just in sight \ud83d\udc95#TheIckabog https://t.co/WDvoBy0GgG Another Favourite Fred the Fearless alert! Ben, these pictures are fantastic, I love them! Fred's moustache, that glorious crown, the wicked misty-bodied Ickabog and a very cute Bert - wonderful! #TheIckabog https://t.co/0H87nIeDrC Look at these glorious pictures! I'm loving the Ickabog, the palace and gorgeous Daisy! (And you're right. We definitely haven't heard the last of Daisy!) #TheIckabog https://t.co/d9JFWFduRo King Fred in all his gorgeous finery \u2764\ufe0f Loving the detail on this, Sophia, especially his monogrammed sleeves! #TheIckabog https://t.co/bD38ADl46E @withlovefromEm Thank you for saying that beautiful thing, birthday sister \u2764\ufe0f \ud83c\udf82 Lettie, this is AWESOME! Your Ickabog\u2019s properly scary, but at the same time really beautiful! \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc96\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/XcWAnNwGLF Ah, I love this Ickabog! He looks a bit devilish (loving the shape of those horns) but also very happy with life! Lovely job, Clara! #TheIckabog https://t.co/lSGDSzzv5i OK, I\u2019ve completely lost my heart to this Ickabog and I might even forgive it for stealing my sheep! Fabulous picture, Abigail! #TheIckabog https://t.co/tQKSwbPPRB These are awesome! Two really different, imaginative Ickabogs, cute, cuddly and looking scared versus confident, demonic and very scary! #TheIckabog https://t.co/LJ6OKgRQWg Kalea, I don\u2019t know how old you are, but I\u2019d have believed it if I\u2019d been told this was done by a professional artist! And the shadowy, half-seen things that live in our heads are the scariest monsters of all. #TheIckabog https://t.co/2b7sSkK6qF @AnitaNelam @giagia @Gingerbread Thank you xxx It\u2019s given me so much joy to see the children\u2019s responses. I\u2019d honestly like to frame this and put it on my wall, Annika, it\u2019s so beautiful \ud83d\udc96 #TheIckabog https://t.co/0SCvOCJg0G I can tell how much thought went into this picture, Dalia, because it\u2019s superb. A really scary Ickabog flanked by a beautifully drawn Fred and Eslanda! #TheIckabog https://t.co/kwbSNrY1KW Another SUPERB picture! Jonas, you\u2019re a proper artist - this has a stylised feel, almost like a playing card, and you\u2019ve given Fred symbols of law and pleasure with the scroll and the cup - magnificent work! #TheIckabog https://t.co/v2OLUKSR0Q Look. At. This. Masterpiece!\n\nBeatrix, you can\u2019t really be 9, can you? Absolutely INCREDIBLE \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\n\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/KBFv6T6tyj Look at these extraordinary drawings. Tommy, I love how you\u2019ve focused on the characters\u2019 feelings, which is such a key part of this story! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude32 #TheIckabog https://t.co/KcW6lh5Pho Paige, this not only a wonderful drawing but it really expresses the sadness Bert and Daisy felt in fighting each other \ud83d\udc94 #TheIckabog https://t.co/qylMG7Hzvo Love this very skillful picture of Fred in his battle dress \u2764\ufe0f Very handsome and fearless-looking! #TheIckabog https://t.co/U5FtLMn1De \u2764\ufe0f A really loveable King Fred and a wonderfully HORRIBLE Ickabog - Connie, I bet you\u2019re very good at writing horror stories! #TheIckabog https://t.co/vFxN6jQu3u Molly, this is such a good picture! I love the look on your Ickabog\u2019s face and the words you\u2019ve got it saying - a thoroughly outraged monster! #TheIckabog https://t.co/hYIAVBpp68 @blenbello \ud83d\udc96 @giagia @Gingerbread I love you right back and this means the world to me. Single parents are superheroes. I love this fabulously creepy Ickabog! It would blend in very well among the rocks and marsh weed! #TheIckabog https://t.co/lEOR5xidi2 I absolutely LOVE this terrifying Ickabog who\u2019s caught poor Patch the dog! Wonderful picture, Amelia! #TheIckabog https://t.co/i1aLyHpqkn Naama, these are wonderful! I love the multicoloured monster and Fred standing in front of his heavily fortified palace (an important part of the story!) #TheIckabog https://t.co/CKeYlyqodO Maya, this picture\u2019s STUNNING! I hope everyone opens it up for a proper look at the wonderful scene you\u2019ve created! #TheIckabog https://t.co/xwNl85nem9 Lily, it took me a while to analyse why this is one of my very favourites of all I\u2019ve been sent. I love EVERYTHING about it: Bert\u2019s expression, the framed drawing of his toy Ickabog and that fire making his house cosy. Just beautiful \ud83d\udc96 #TheIckabog https://t.co/C1Xa5MHyB9 Isabella, I enjoyed looking at every detail of this picture! I LOVE your Ickabog and all its different powers, though I feel a bit sorry for the little sheep getting splatted with poison! #TheIckabog https://t.co/fkpuhr0ksz Kate, these are brilliant - your Bert and Daisy are so full of personality (and as it happens, I imagine Daisy as a brunette, too!) as for the golden tongs \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude02 #TheIckabog https://t.co/xjBtDf3cMv Alma, how can you be only 8?! That\u2019s one of the very best Ickabogs I\u2019ve seen! I also love poor Daisy\u2019s old dresses \ud83d\udc94 #TheIckabog https://t.co/Bmp5IYgGEZ Emily, you\u2019ve really listened to the story and your Ickabog is a truly fantastic monster! I love how you\u2019ve combined all the myths about it \u2764\ufe0f #TheIckabog https://t.co/uUXBVLjW0P Amanda, this is an amazingly good picture and very moving! You\u2019ve got so much in here, including Daisy\u2019s new house and the gloomy trees. Incredible! #TheIckabog https://t.co/cg2fVVlJDs These are so wonderful! I love the fear on the man\u2019s face as he stands in front of that huge fanged mouth, and the gigantic Ickabog in the mist is incredible\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f#TheIckabog https://t.co/m01RPBcgIF An absolutely STUNNING picture of King Fred, Stella! You\u2019re so talented! I love everything from crown to expression to picture frame! #TheIckabog https://t.co/QWrh29Q1Hu I really love this very accomplished picture of the Ickabog (7, Clara?!) who looks both scary and funny! He also seems to have been caught and put in jail! #TheIckabog https://t.co/lAmYN7XYNt Gorgeous. This is exactly how I imagine the topography of Cornucopia, Sarah aged 20+9 \u2764\ufe0f #TheIckabog https://t.co/2Y92xHaRrQ Rashid, I LOVED looking at all your illustrations! They\u2019re wonderful and your Day I\u2019d Petition was the first I\u2019ve seen! #TheIckabog https://t.co/1ZwQu7JaeL Amy, this is a spectacular picture and one of my favourites of Fred! You\u2019ve really caught his attitude with his expression and the way he\u2019s standing! Beautifully detailed, too! #TheIckabog https://t.co/RSPYAlhORi I love this picture of Fred with his medal, Adhyaksha! He looks so proud! #TheIckabog https://t.co/lXesp3oLBm This is a GREAT picture of a really scary Ickabog! I love the eyes! #TheIckabog https://t.co/SMdGBwUkKi These are really wonderful and made me smile! #TheIckabog https://t.co/VuqDXHpxoq Arlo, this is a really scary Ickabog and of course it would wear a boxing glove to punch people who came into its marsh \ud83e\udd4a #TheIckabog https://t.co/NZkcQcYpRu Kai, your Ickabog looks really fierce and scary! I love its spiky body and fangs! #TheIckabog https://t.co/nkMooZk9uj Dylan, I can tell you\u2019ve listened carefully to the story, because your spooky monster\u2019s hissing and its tail has three heads as though it\u2019s splitting into more Ickabogs! I love it! #TheIckabog https://t.co/pKm2FCRdQc Esm\u00e9, I love your golden-haired and golden-crowned King Fred the Fearless and his gorgeous scarlet cloak! #TheIckabog https://t.co/DrE1uubSby A stunning castle, I love it! #TheIckabog https://t.co/DgxW9gQbOl The saddest, most atmospheric picture I've received so far. Absolutely amazing, Holland \ud83d\udc94 https://t.co/50m2VcF0Iq Wow, wow, wow... and I haven't forgotten that you were the one account that knew what my headers were hinting at! #TheIckabog https://t.co/LSYzAxrEkm I'm not surprised children all over Cornucopia are scared of this biting them if they stray from the garden! A magnificent Ickabog! #TheIckabog https://t.co/fN9202JiDg Chace, that Ickabog really is scary. I'd be terrified seeing that walking towards me out of the mist! Excellent picture! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Rzlr5xZYIF I find this picture strangely moving - a sweet little Ickabog emerging out of the fog and gloom! It's wonderful, Ellen! #TheIckabog https://t.co/rQuRSP6MPF Sophia, this is one of the most imaginative Ickabogs I've seen and I love it! The monster looks as though it's emitting spooky brainwaves! #TheIckabog https://t.co/XByimFLgW8 @lindaarella .@lindaarella I had to turn this picture up the right way so everyone could see it, because it's absolutely extraordinary! I can hardly believe Jessica's only 12! https://t.co/J8B2uSz8Nu I'm loving Fred the Fearless's dark twinkle, Nour, and I love his outfit! #TheIckabog https://t.co/P5fMxTcqTs Dom, this is such a great (and slightly terrifying) picture! I love your snakelike Ickabog with a person bursting out of its tail! #TheIckabog https://t.co/OYvelRzWUu I have to agree with Shivaan - he's nailed it! #TheIckabog https://t.co/NVzdL5lgtp That makes me so happy! I love your beautiful Lady Eslanda in her scarlet dress, Evie! #TheIckabog https://t.co/pOJXBFUgXO Boond, you're so talented - I love the Ickabog splitting into many Ickabogs, all the shocked sheep and that poor child! #TheIckabog https://t.co/x0Ict7Qjg3 Aurora, this is such a wonderful picture, it's made me hungry! #TheIckabog https://t.co/THt3LZkC1c This is a fantastic Fred the Fearless! I absolutely love his expression, his outfit and his curly hair and moustache! #TheIckabog https://t.co/Jd7WZm3i7S @kchrissylee It is! @puddy1234 \u2665\ufe0fOh, I'm very human. Some idiocy like this happens to me roughly three times a week! But thank you. Hugs are always welcome. Also, please check your DMs! There's a signed book for your daughter in it! Look at this picture - every time I think I should go and cook some dinner, another incredible illustration catches my eye. Esther, this is STUNNING! #TheIckabog https://t.co/WdCOXhz8OQ Isla, this is MAGNIFICENT. I can't get over the beauty and detail you've got in here! Absolutely amazing! #TheIckabog https://t.co/ucaJOsGFZd @Amy_Writes_Book \ud83d\ude18 Definitely one of the most incredible maps I've seen so far, Yufei! The detail's perfect and it's so well drawn! #TheIckabog https://t.co/tnlAPm6M9N The contrast between these two is fantastic and they're both such good pictures! The scary green one would be well camouflaged in marsh weed but the multicoloured one would certainly fool people into thinking he's not dangerous! #TheIckabog https://t.co/31MlIQUZYG I have another favourite Ickabog! I love that he's so helpful to people, handing out safety masks! This Ickabog is DEFINITELY misunderstood! #TheIckabog https://t.co/G8lfMp3kzI I really love that very spooky, very accomplished Ickabog and the sweet picture of Daisy, Joy! #TheIckabog https://t.co/zxASjizLk1 I can't believe she's only six (nearly seven), because this is a beautiful illustrated map and I absolutely love it! #TheIckabog https://t.co/T9peEQg00z Eli, this picture's stunning! The different creatures' heads, the colours and the clever idea behind the bright colours - perfect! #TheIckabog https://t.co/3cZ4UdSzSO However, I am not - as many of the people now swarming into my mentions seem to think - ashamed of reading about the assault. You should know by now that accusations of thought crime leave me cold. Take your censorship and authoritarianism elsewhere. They don't work on me. I'm going to say this once and I'm going to say it calmly and politely. I certainly didn't mean to paste a quotation from a message about the assault of Maria Maclaughlin into a tweet to a child, especially given the language used by the person convicted of the crime 1/2 @TaraOComics Of course I copied it. What I didn't mean to do was paste it into a message about a child's picture. @NicESpurling OK, time to take this off Twitter, I think. @StephPerniciaro It didn't... I'm mortified! This is what happens when you're not paying attention and accidentally cut and paste from an ENTIRELY different kind of message. (Sorry about the random and totally unconnected sentence that made its way in there. I accidentally pasted in part of a very un-Ickaboggish message I'd just received \ud83d\ude33) I love this Ickabog with bat ears, bloodstained fangs and mismatched eyes! A really amazing picture! https://t.co/UgWFanRmZ8 This Ickabog is particularly frightening. I think you should have attached some kind of warning to it.\n#TheIckabog https://t.co/ZShLgZ3s5F Theo, this is an INCREDIBLE picture of King Fred the Fearless! I love every part of the picture! He looks so pleased with himself and his clothes are suitably gorgeous! #TheIckabog https://t.co/FBZsJcVECW These are so good! I love everything, the flag, the Ickabog, the beautiful cake and the little Dovetail cottage! \ud83d\udc95\ud83c\udf3c#TheIckabog https://t.co/Z5ICTchyyQ I suspect the artist might be a little older than 12, but you should all enjoy this incredible picture of Bert having his nightmare about the Ickabog! #TheIckabog https://t.co/MmiHMrHD0j This is one of my very favourite Ickabogs and I can't believe it was drawn by somebody who's 5! Fisher, this is a magnificent picture and you've really made him look as though he's a water creature! #TheIckabog https://t.co/gFCmO7tmXa Oh, this is a WONDERFUL King Fred the Fearless! You have to open it up fully to see the legs! It's his stance that makes him look royal and pleased with his own manliness! #TheIckabog https://t.co/bpL4To9p2f These are both fantastic Ickabogs and I really think I'd have known Lewis thought he was a goodie and Jasper a baddie just from their interpretations! Excellent work! #TheIckabog https://t.co/jdleRv12lG Millie, these are all so good, but I'm going to have to single out your Flapoon and Spittleworth as particularly wonderful! I also love that chunky chestnut horse! #TheIckabog https://t.co/oHdfMkVUBg Everyone needs to open up this picture to see its fully glory! Edward, this Ickabog is superb! A really accomplished drawing - I love the unimpressed look on the sheep's face! #TheIckabog https://t.co/lguxM21kX3 Sienna, this golden pumpkin carriage is PERFECT for a Cornucopian king! I also love that the horse is white, because that's the colour I made Fred's charger! #TheIckabog https://t.co/HVDSJ0qapN @NicESpurling of your published claims that 1) I cannot be trusted around children and 2) that I have 'attacked trans people.' @NicESpurling I'm afraid your lawyers might need a little more than my tweet in support for Maya Forstater, who believes that humans are a dimorphic species, but who has stated her unequivocal commitment to treating trans people with respect. Again, I must ask you to provide evidence \n1/2 @NicESpurling Truth has always been far more important to me than clickbait, Nicola. Please provide your evidence that a) I can't be trusted around children and b) that I 'attack trans folks'. Chapters 9 &amp; 10 of The Ickabog are now available to read!\n\nDon't forget that we aren't posting new chapters on Saturday or Sunday, but this will give lots of time to catch up on your paintings and drawings of the first ten chapters! \n\nhttps://t.co/afFEfRzeH2 @palaoantrongko Congratulations! \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f https://t.co/rOj7Ih10lz I love this picture! Fred's face, his magnificent crown and his outfit are wonderful! #TheIckabog https://t.co/xRDUwyQkXO @Michell95515821 \u2665\ufe0fWhat a truly lovely message. It has made up for... certain rather different messages! xxx Aww, Charlotte, you've expressed your idea perfectly! He does look scary, but also as though he might look very cute when smiling! \ud83d\ude0d#TheIckabog https://t.co/kAL3IrcADA Ah, I love seeing the development of first idea to finished masterpiece! They're both wonderful! The multi-eyed Ickabog is truly odd and frightening and the cave-dwelling one reminds me of a giant cave salamander - equally creepy! #TheIckabog https://t.co/YEEZOeD3iM Just over half an hour to go! https://t.co/pkgDkvLrvE Cressy, I love this spiky, spiny, flame-throwing Ickabog! Definitely a monster to avoid on a lonely marsh! #TheIckabog https://t.co/5e6hIjcoUy Evan, this is a stunning picture! Putting the eyes on the hands is a magnificent scary touch! I'm loving everything: the teeth, the tail and the wings! #TheIckabog https://t.co/y0BRjPtteZ A SUPERB Ickabog, suitably strange and mythical, with plenty of detail! I love it! \ud83d\udc95#TheIckabog https://t.co/4aqQNd77PY I can't quite get over how brilliant this picture is, Calleigh - Fred's expression is spot on, his clothes are perfect and he really does look as though he's enjoying waving at loyal subjects! Are you sure you're 10?! #TheIckabog https://t.co/hgAdNq3tBY Ernest, this is a FANTASTIC Ickabog in every sense! A really spooky, otherworldly monster and a wonderful illustration! #TheIckabog https://t.co/jvWyed86jK Ah, the cushion of rings that Fred rejected! I love this, Katie, it's gorgeous, especially the fringing around the cushion! #TheIckabog https://t.co/ZA6i5WcCMv I love this picture so much! King Fred looks handsome and happy in his sapphire-encrusted crown - perfect, given how much he loves finery! #TheIckabog https://t.co/qvuQV8zNb0 How could I not notice this?! Seriously considering making it my desktop picture! #TheIckabog https://t.co/wsmR5u543r @NicESpurling Unless you want to hear from lawyers, you might want to rethink that tweet. I'm not wasting time arguing with wilful misrepresentations of my views on transgenderism - your timeline shows you're not big on truth - but making serious insinuations like this comes with consequences. Bella, are you sure you're six? I think we've got another professional illustrator in the making! Three wonderful different versions of the Ickabog, a magnificent Fred and a gorgeous Lady Eslanda, and so much more! \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f#TheIckabog https://t.co/d7DHJPTdHx Arlo, you've produced another of my favourite Ickabogs, going about its many adventures! Fiery fangs and feathery wings: perfect \ud83d\udc95#TheIckabog https://t.co/iToIaoTCms Matilda, what an artist you are! An Ickabog that's wolfish, dragonish and serpent-like: you've captured every aspect and somehow made them into a strangely beautiful monster! #TheIckabog https://t.co/abBG9PYZaY Ruby, this is stunning! You've created an Ickabog like the magical chimera, which is comprised of many different beasts!

But I think it's this one.) https://t.co/29IA3eHHl9 @DickLeFenwick You visited Nicolsons?! That one\u2019s true! I used to write in Nicolsons all the time. I once wrote an entire chapter in there in one sitting and barely changed a word afterwards. Those are the days you remember. I think Nicolsons is now a Chinese Restaurant. https://t.co/JNKDP0ywJK I sometimes hear Hogwarts was based on one or other of Edinburgh\u2019s schools, but that\u2019s 100% false, too. Hogwarts was created long before I clapped eyes on any of them! I did finish Hallows in the Balmoral, though, &amp; I can\u2019t lie, I\u2019d rate it a smidge higher than the Bournville. https://t.co/Evt0ttqfYH This building is in Manchester and used to be the Bourneville Hotel (Pretty sure it's this building. It might be the one along). Anyway, I spent a single night there in 1991, and when I left next morning, I'd invented Quidditch. https://t.co/gNzAanTw20 @tomswanston it is a lovely place. I can't write in there any more, but I would if I could! * If you define the birthplace of Harry Potter as the moment when I had the initial idea, then it was a Manchester-London train. But I'm perennially amused by the idea that Hogwarts was directly inspired by beautiful places I saw or visited, because it's so far from the truth. This is the true birthplace of Harry Potter, if you define 'birthplace' as the spot where I put pen to paper for the first time.* I was renting a room in a flat over what was then a sports shop. The first bricks of Hogwarts were laid in a flat in Clapham Junction. https://t.co/HVORnPVboK I saw that sign when I was in there a couple of years ago and it made me laugh.

Art is unique to humanity and it bolsters our humanity. /4 In times like these, and speaking as somebody who has several key workers in her immediate family, I can see why some people might regard artists, writers etc as about as much use as Cacofonix the Bard on the battlefield (Asterix reference, if you haven\u2019t read it, do) /3 However, you also seem to be asserting that I never benefited from government support as an artist. This is inaccurate. I received a grant from a government supported arts programme that enabled me to finish my second book. /2 .@DannyMalouf2020 As I keep being tagged into this ongoing debate, so I\u2019m going to weigh in.

And she spake further, \u2018do ye not see that St Jeremy is hurting your party, yea, that his inability even to organise a vote of no confidence\n12 But she did then look up and see many stars shining brightly in the sky and lo, they did arrange themselves before her eyes into a \u2018who would make the best Prime Minister poll\u2019 and she did cry, \u2018Will ye not raise up your eyes to the Heavens?
