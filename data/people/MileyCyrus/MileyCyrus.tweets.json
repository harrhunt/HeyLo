BUT at this point I had to make a healthy decision for myself to leave a previous life behind. I am the healthiest and happiest I have been in a long time.  You can say I am a twerking, pot smoking , foul mouthed hillbilly but I am not a liar. I can admit to a lot of things but I refuse to admit that my marriage ended because of cheating. Liam and I have been together for a decade. I\u2019ve said it before &amp; it remains true, I love Liam and always will. But the truth is, once Liam &amp; I reconciled,I meant it, &amp; I was committed. There are NO secrets to uncover here. I\u2019ve learned from every experience in my life. I\u2019m not perfect, I don\u2019t want to be, it\u2019s boring. I\u2019ve grown up in front of you, but the bottom line is, I HAVE GROWN UP. There are probably more nudes of me on the internet than maybe any woman in history. I swung on a wrecking ball naked. I got kicked off hotel Transylvania for buying Liam a penis cake for his birthday and licking it. I lost a massive Walmart deal at 17 for ripping a bong. I fucked up and cheated in relationships when I was young. It is no secret that I was into partying in my teens and early 20\u2019s. I have not only smoked, but advocated for weed, I\u2019ve experimented with drugs, my biggest song to date is about dancing on molly and snorting lines in the bathroom. I can accept that the life I\u2019ve chosen means I must live completely open and transparent with my fans who I love, and the public, 100% of the time. What I cannot accept is being told I\u2019m lying to cover up a crime I haven\u2019t committed. I have nothing to hide. Slide Away. https://t.co/ziLo5sF2en https://t.co/ASc8RrW0Xj https://t.co/cVh5YHUW7b Life\u2019s a climb... but the view is great. https://t.co/mE8lYlfCMQ My dad always told me \u201c Nature never hurries but it is always on time\u201d.... it fills my heart with peace and hope KNOWING that is true.

(right up there with Joan &amp; The Blackhearts) These lyrics always rang so true to me in my world..... I was \"afraid of changin\" .... cause I \"built my life around you\" , that always meant to me personally, everything I had built in MY life (especially my career) was based on Still thinkin about last night.... feels like a dream. I had the opportunity to sing Landslide (top 3 favorite song of all time) in front of Stevie Nicks (I am so thankful for these lyrics) &amp; Fleetwood Mac!
