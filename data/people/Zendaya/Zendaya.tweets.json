To stop and acknowledge the people in our lives who make it possible to do the work we do and honestly, make life worth living. It comes in many forms and sometimes it\u2019s just a thank you. We made this as a family, shot it in 14 days with a 22 person crew I am eternally grateful for. For their talent, their time, their hard work, and their willingness to believe in this film. If there\u2019s anything to learn from this year, and I hope from our little movie... even try. This is really my first time believing that maybe I could. This is my first time being a leading lady, but also my first time being this creatively involved in something, producing something, co-financing something, owning something and sharing it all with my crew. Full of excitement and nervousness as this lil movie we made in lockdown with people I love is coming out in the next hour. Nervousness for a few reasons.
