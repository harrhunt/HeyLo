Thanks @TaylorSwift13 for catching up with us! #TaylorSwiftOnSeacrest https://t.co/g8xAzmPu2C @taylorswift13 .@TaylorSwift13's not sure if she'll play #Lover in stadiums.

This whole phase of my life is very much about freedom and the #Lover album to me completely represents freedom.\u201d #TaylorSwiftOnSeacrest If @TaylorSwift13 will re-record her past albums differently, she tells me: \u201cI\u2019m really going to be listening to the fans because there are some amazing ideas that they\u2019ve had.\u201d\n\nHere you go #Swifties. Time to submit those ideas. #TaylorSwiftOnSeacrest On getting the best album reviews she's ever received with #Lover, she says: \"It gets me emotional even talking about it.
