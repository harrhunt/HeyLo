This is an emergency Not to belabor the conversation from over the wknd, but you don\u2019t solve mass hunger, high unemployment, huge slowdown in the economy caused by pandemic w/charitable donations.

Amazing! #VoiceBattles #TeamLegend Thank you people who chose! https://t.co/7TPCbcQZoc @andraydomise @mcuban @jonshonric Carry on bro. Have a lovely weekend @andraydomise @mcuban @jonshonric Brilliant work @andraydomise @mcuban @jonshonric Haha you googled my net worth and think it\u2019s an actual source. @andraydomise @mcuban @jonshonric I wanted Warren to be the nominee for President but the people of the party picked Biden and he was the nominee.  Ordinary people voted and chose him. Clyburn endorsement helped but the people chose. @andraydomise @mcuban @jonshonric What is your alternative?  Have you and your buddies pick the party representatives because you know better than ordinary people in the district?  Democracy is imperfect and frustrating but the people have to decide and the candidate has to convince them somehow @andraydomise @mcuban @jonshonric It\u2019s not my job to know every upstart primary candidate for 435 seats in Congress. It\u2019s their job to make themselves known to their community and win their primary. It\u2019s difficult but it\u2019s doable.  I don\u2019t know what else to say. This is how you change the makeup of the House @mcuban @jonshonric @andraydomise And AOC proved that literally going door to door and organizing locally and listening to the needs of the community could overcome the party machine. @mcuban @jonshonric @andraydomise I agree that these are barriers to entry for disruptive candidates who don\u2019t have party backing and financing. But they\u2019re not insurmountable barriers, particularly in an era with many candidates who are powered by individual online smaller donations @mcuban @jonshonric @andraydomise By the way, if the people in Pelosi\u2019s district want to primary her and vote for someone else, they have every right to. That\u2019s how democracy works. Again, that\u2019s how AOC and Cori Bush and others are in the House. @mcuban @jonshonric @andraydomise Agreed that our system needs reform. But the only way we have to do it is through.... democracy. Democracy is literally government by the people. We need to vote in the right reps and encourage them to change the laws that are harmful to the country @mcuban @jonshonric @andraydomise The party leadership doesn\u2019t pick their representatives. The ordinary people in the party do. That\u2019s how we got AOC and Trump. They were both not the party leadership\u2019s pick. If you have beef with the party\u2019s representatives, run someone else and win the votes @andraydomise @mcuban @jonshonric THEY WANT TO BE RE-ELECTED @andraydomise @mcuban @jonshonric And we should continue to pay attention after we put them in office. Hold them accountable. Tell them what we want. @andraydomise @mcuban @jonshonric Chrissy and I also raise lots of money for Feeding America and City Harvest etc but be clear that the federal government has the power and funds to do wayyyyyy more than any charity. It\u2019s not even close. So it\u2019s very meaningful to make sure we have the best reps in power @andraydomise @mcuban @jonshonric What i don\u2019t know is the marginal impact of any donation to a candidate or party or GOTV organizer. So maybe all of them have enough money to wage this election fight. But I\u2019m donating in case they don\u2019t and because the difference in outcomes could be quite stark and significant @andraydomise @mcuban @jonshonric And this particular situation (GA election) will mean the difference between the Dems being in control or the GOP. So it is pivotal and the difference in outcomes could be quite meaningful in real people\u2019s lives @andraydomise @mcuban @jonshonric I will never put all my faith in any politician.But there are clear differences between the parties and the Democrats tend to be more willing to use government resources to aid the poor and working class (extend healthcare, increase unemployment benefits, increase min wage, Snap) @mcuban @jonshonric @andraydomise We should care who those representatives are and try to pick the best ones. We should have campaign finance and voting rights reform and end gerrymandering to make sure our representatives are actually representative and accountable @mcuban @jonshonric @andraydomise Any other solution (relying on the whims and largesse of unaccountable billionaires and their foundations, for instance) are inferior to democracy @mcuban @jonshonric @andraydomise That\u2019s democracy. But i don\u2019t know a better alternative. We pay taxes, pool our money together, pick representatives to allocate and administer the resources in the best interest of the community and hold them accountable. We\u2019re so proud of this movie!  I hope you get to watch it with your family this weekend. Let me know what you think! https://t.co/lTYIfYddYG Ever wondered what song I would play if a bear was running toward me and my family? Of course you have!

As\u2026 Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey is now streaming on @Netflix! #EverythingIsPossible @StrongBlackLead @NetflixFilm https://t.co/vU0cJVoSSB @AnandWrites Bruh. Trying to tell him @mcuban ...point of diminishing returns for donating to the runoffs in Georgia. It\u2019s hard to know. But I plan to err on the side of donating to help Ossoff and Warnock win.  I hope it works. It will be better for the country @mcuban I believe the Democrats will do more to help the country recover. Period. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s even close. Mitch will be obstructionist and try to find ways to make Biden a one-term president, just as he promised (and failed) to do with Obama. But i don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve reached the @mcuban And there is clearly a difference between what a Mitch-led senate will do vs what a Schumer-led senate will do.   As much as politics is annoying, this is very high stakes and hugely impactful to the lives of everyday Americans. @mcuban Agree that there is a point of diminishing returns to political ad spending. So we should choose whether or not to donate with that in mind. But charity isn\u2019t going to be sufficient to address all the suffering out there. We need big spending that only governments can do at scale @mcuban That being said, I\u2019ll be doing both @mcuban I get that politics is annoying and contentious, but the bottom line is that the Senate flipping would be far more impactful than a food bank donation. We need massive stimulus and aid to individuals and small businesses. Government needs to do this. Charity isn\u2019t sufficient Hey guys. Sen Johnson would like to be emailed about the postal service. https://t.co/DG4guMHmUv Fact check: Trump is currently at 72.4M so he can\u2019t even round up to 73M.

Congratulations, @GeorgeGascon, on this much-needed win for LA! Judge @FanonRucker would have brought a wealth of experience to the District Attorney Office.

But just know we\u2019re grateful and we\u2019re sending love to all of you and your families. More than anything, we\u2019ve heard so many stories about how so many other families have experienced this pain, often suffering in silence.  It\u2019s a club no one wants to be a part of, but it\u2019s comforting to know we\u2019re not alone. Thank you to everyone who has been sending us prayers and well wishes, flowers, cards, words of comfort and empathy.  We feel and appreciate your love and support more than you know. We promised each other this on our wedding day seven years ago, and every challenge we\u2019ve faced has made that promise more powerful, more resilient.  Our love will remain. We will never break. I wrote this song because I have faith that as long as we walk this earth, we will hold each other\u2019s hands through every tear, through every up and down, through every test. I\u2019m in awe of the strength you\u2019ve shown through the most challenging moments. What an awesome gift it is to be able to bring life into the world.  We\u2019ve experienced the miracle, the power and joy of this gift, and now we\u2019ve deeply felt its inherent fragility. This is for Chrissy.  I love and cherish you and our family so much.

Over 4,000 COVID 19 deaths.  All of these deaths matter, and every life is precious.  But it's clear Trump has no interest in healing people / saving lives.  Just in waging war to look tough for reelection. Usually the Wag the Dog scenario is to go to other countries to start a war when your polls are in the tank.  Nope.  Trump just wants to wage war on America's neighborhoods We don't have enough testing or contact tracing.  We have the virus spreading like wildfire.  The economy is in the dumps.  What do we need?  More police?  This is fucking stupid. Welp, I looked it up.  In the middle of a once in a century pandemic where the US has far more deaths than any other country and unemployment is sky high, POTUS decides the states are just fine dealing with the pandemic, but need the feds policing black neighborhoods https://t.co/8NcP31QK0m I wasn't briefed on #OperationLegend.

Let's keep fighting for all of this. Presidential politics is very unsatisfying when you're trying to push for radical change and they're trying to put together a majority coalition. Either way, let's keep fighting for it. This is not merely an intellectual exercise. It's life and death. And the real world implications of electing (or reelecting) someone who doesn't know how to run the government are particularly urgent and impactful in the middle of a pandemic that's been so much more deadly due to an incompetent President Part of an artist's job is to imagine a different future. I appreciate the desire to break free from the strictures of the 2-party system in America, for instance. But you can't divorce that conversation from the real world implications of rooting for a futile 3rd party bid. If you are going to speak out, try to do your homework. Read about it. Talk to activists and organizers and people impacted.  Be open to evolution and changing your mind. Be intentional and strategic.  And think about the impact of your words on the real lives of real people It ain't for everybody.  If you're more comfortable just making bops, do that.  We need that in our lives too! Reporters always ask me if more artists should speak out about politics. I always say ummmmmm not necessarily. @chrissyteigen i also picked it up with my bare hand and took it to the toilet because i give up @chrissyteigen facts.  all facts. @ewarren Happy Anniversary!! @DycOfficial @Twitter @jack @Blackbirds @TwitterDetroit Beautiful.

But, to be fair, she simply isn't the impetus. The conversation has been ongoing and folks have been doing significant work around this issue for years @ReignOfApril @saraherib And @prisonculture had a great interview with @chrislhayes on #WITHPod about abolition as well @ReignOfApril @saraherib There are a lot of folks working on restorative justice models around the country.

Then we did some finishing touches over the past few months.  The oldest song is Always. I wrote it with @EsterDean and @HEYDJCAMPER back in the Love In the Future sessions in 2011/2012. https://t.co/Wa8P7V4trT When I was young, I always wanted to be a singer. But I also loved watching Matlock and wanted to be a defense lawyer who fought for the falsely accused.

She tours with me in my band and also makes her own solo records https://t.co/0WCxAfceAH I wrote this one in a great session with Mr Hudson, Greg Wells and Nasri.  It probably took a few hours to write. It was one of the earlier songs I wrote for this album, but it feels even more needed and poignant now https://t.co/yA42UQo5k6 I almost always write the music first.

Watch the #ShermansShowcase Black History Month Spectacular June 19th on @AMC_TV &amp; @IFC. https://t.co/KY5BvYhXuC @lang_lang Happy birthday, brother! Celebrating Juneteenth with a special edition of #Verzuz! It's a battle of the pianos with me vs. @AliciaKeys this Friday, June 19th at 8ET/5PT @verzuzonline https://t.co/uttjPbMKDd @originalkoffee Thank YOU!  You're incredible! I\u2019ve got your Father\u2019s Day plans covered. Join my family and friends on Sunday, June 21st for #JohnLegendFathersDay at 8|7c on @ABCNetwork! #BiggerLove https://t.co/HsDHI2Gaou A week from today, on June 19, I invite you to experience a #BiggerLove. I debuted in 2004 with an album called Get Lifted.  And now, as we enter the summer of 2020, I hope this new album can get you lifted again, fill your hearts with love and inspiration, give you something to dance to, something to hold hands to, something to make love to. I\u2019m under no illusion that music can save the world or solve the world\u2019s problems, but I\u2019ve always turned to music to help me through tough times and I know many of you have done the same.  That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t wait to release this album to the world. But It\u2019s important for us to continue to show the world the fullness of what it is to be black &amp; human. Through our art, we are able to do that. This album is a celebration of love, joy, sensuality, hope, &amp; resilience, the things that make our culture so beautiful &amp; influential. Lately, the images of black people in the media have been showing us with knees on our necks, in mourning, or expressing our collective outrage.  We feel all those emotions. All of these songs were created prior to the world being rocked by a pandemic, prior to the latest police killings in the U.S. that sent so many to the streets in protest.  During these painful times, some of us may wonder if it\u2019s ok to laugh or dance or be romantic. The songs are inspired by the loves of my life:  my wife, my family and the rich tradition of black music that has made me the artist I am. This project has been a labor of love for me, something I\u2019ve spent over a year conceiving and creating.  I poured my heart and soul into these songs and collaborated with some incredibly gifted co-writers, producers and musicians. I\u2019m so excited to introduce my new album #BiggerLove to the world.  Here\u2019s the album cover painted by brilliant artist Charly Palmer.  Check out the track list, including my amazing featured guests. https://t.co/nWu6Y2JhRH I support #TeamJoe because this nightmare of a presidency needs to end. Join us tomorrow, Thursday, June 11th: https://t.co/RNa2jZ5Iht https://t.co/tj7gJ19VJJ @dreamhampton Go Dream! RT @TVGuide: Sherman's Showcase's hilariously unapologetic Black History Month Spectacular could not have come at a better time https://t.c\u2026 Proud to see that our #GetLiftedFilmCo production \"Atlanta's Missing and Murdered\" is nominated for 2 @CriticsChoice #RealTVAwards for Best Crime/Justice Series and Best Limited Documentary Series.  Watch it on demand on @HBO! This is from the brand new @ShermansShow special airing on June 19th on AMC/IFC! Man. We got the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States of America to promo a @ShermansShow song #AddSomeKente https://t.co/3u5tvmePQ4 Everyone was saying $15 minimum wage and Medicare for All and gay marriage were also unrealistic and ridiculous but activists moved the conversation and pushed politicians toward progress It's not the job of grass roots activists on the left to craft political messaging for mainstream democratic candidates. I'm almost 100% sure Biden won't be tweeting #DefundThePolice.  It's the job of activists to push these politicians toward meaningful change. \"defund\" is the word because it says we're taking away some funding from one budget item and moving it to higher priorities. \"reform\" or \"retrain\" does not at all suggest the same thing. We've been supposedly doing the latter for decades This doesn't mean there will be no police; it means there should be significantly fewer police and more professionals of other types with expertise in their fields, whether it's social work, health care, conflict resolution, drug treatment, etc Whenever there are budget cuts, those \"softer\" services are on the chopping block first.  And, since we know we're not solving the underlying problems, we figure we better keep a huge police force to contain them.  Let's resolve to do differently.  Let's imagine a healthier world And that choice comes at a cost. We defund housing support, health care, education and child care, the arts, drug treatment, community centers, all sorts of services that would actually reduce the problems that we ask the police to surveil and contain Police funding takes up a huge portion of our local budgets. Budgets are moral documents which spell out in black and white what our priorities are. We have finite amounts of money to spend and right now we spend far too much on policing Some intentionally want to cast the argument in extremes like that so they can score political points. But I ask that those of you who are reasonable and actually care about making this country healthy and safe for all people engage with the thoughtful arguments in this piece I know this word \"defund\" has caused some controversy, even from some who are inclined to agree with a lot of the underlying arguments. Some hear that word and envision The Purge, some dystopian descent into anarchy A Black Mother Discusses Defunding the Police https://t.co/myJRLSWYgQ Happy birthday to Breonna Taylor https://t.co/NfvfMA9KnW RT @ava: My God.

Dr King was unpopular, was harassed and spied upon by the FBI and then assassinated.  Kaepernick quietly went to one knee and lost his career. They just want us to shut up and take it.  They don't want any protest, peaceful or otherwise @_ZaNYATO_ Haha fake black person.  Hi \"bruh\" Preservers of the status quo will always try to equate protesting with violence so that they can change the narrative from the systemic and immediate causes of these very legitimate, predominantly peaceful protests. Don't fall for it.  These protests were caused by state violence Excellent question. Perhaps you should ask the police because THEY DO IT ALL THE TIME.  Ask any activist advocating for marginalized groups.  That's why these legal aid and bailout funds are prepared to deal with this. They're used to it. Some of you think that supporting a bailout fund means we're supporting people who intentionally harm people or destroy property because \"why would the police arrest and jail peaceful protestors?\" @AndrewYang Take away police funding and reroute it towards community needs (like health care, maybe a UBI!) Prevent crime through community edification.  Let's stop trying to solve problems by hiring more law enforcement Please stay as safe as you can. There is still a deadly virus that thrives on people being really close to each other. Distance as much as possible and wear a mask to protect yourself and others! Americans have the first amendment right to peacefully protest oppression and injustice. Chrissy and I will be donating to these 3 organizations which are organizing, supporting and defending those marching for justice:  @Mvmnt4BlkLives @nlgnews @bailproject https://t.co/whxOPQQuTu If you think whatever bad conditions in your community would be solved by more police, consider the possibility of spending that same money on schools, health care, drug addiction treatment, housing support.  We do everything ass-backwards Meanwhile, billions of dollars of exploitation, fraud and other white collar crime happens with no arrests, no police involvement, nothing. We need to divest in our entire system of overincarceration and overpolicing. We are not made safer or closer to justice by any of it. Consider the fact that 4 police officers responded to the alleged use of a $20 counterfeit bill. Do we have too many police officers or too few? This young woman was killed in her home for no reason.  We don't have a video, but it still happened.
