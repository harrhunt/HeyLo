Over 4,000 COVID 19 deaths.  All of these deaths matter, and every life is precious.  But it's clear Trump has no interest in healing people / saving lives.  Just in waging war to look tough for reelection. Usually the Wag the Dog scenario is to go to other countries to start a war when your polls are in the tank.  Nope.  Trump just wants to wage war on America's neighborhoods We don't have enough testing or contact tracing.  We have the virus spreading like wildfire.  The economy is in the dumps.  What do we need?  More police?  This is fucking stupid. Welp, I looked it up.

Let's keep fighting for all of this. Presidential politics is very unsatisfying when you're trying to push for radical change and they're trying to put together a majority coalition. Either way, let's keep fighting for it. This is not merely an intellectual exercise. It's life and death. And the real world implications of electing (or reelecting) someone who doesn't know how to run the government are particularly urgent and impactful in the middle of a pandemic that's been so much more deadly due to an incompetent President Part of an artist's job is to imagine a different future. I appreciate the desire to break free from the strictures of the 2-party system in America, for instance. But you can't divorce that conversation from the real world implications of rooting for a futile 3rd party bid. If you are going to speak out, try to do your homework. Read about it. Talk to activists and organizers and people impacted.  Be open to evolution and changing your mind. Be intentional and strategic.  And think about the impact of your words on the real lives of real people It ain't for everybody.  If you're more comfortable just making bops, do that.  We need that in our lives too! Reporters always ask me if more artists should speak out about politics. I always say ummmmmm not necessarily. @chrissyteigen i also picked it up with my bare hand and took it to the toilet because i give up @chrissyteigen facts.  all facts. @ewarren Happy Anniversary!!

I\u2019m so honored to have his work as the face of this project. Since most of you aren\u2019t getting physical copies of the music these days, I decided to give you the enhanced credits to tell you the story of the album. We\u2019ll start with the images you see. Charly Palmer is the brilliant artist who painted the album cover. I\u2019m so glad #BiggerLove is finally out! We\u2019ve been working on this project for the last 18 months or so, and I got to collaborate with some amazing people. https://t.co/40H9zg9x2o https://t.co/XPtk0mzfN9 Hanging out and performing on @GMA this morning - tune in to watch! https://t.co/NPlXAcn9wM There will be CDs and Vinyl coming soon-ish.

Then we did some finishing touches over the past few months.  The oldest song is Always. I wrote it with @EsterDean and @HEYDJCAMPER back in the Love In the Future sessions in 2011/2012. https://t.co/Wa8P7V4trT When I was young, I always wanted to be a singer. But I also loved watching Matlock and wanted to be a defense lawyer who fought for the falsely accused. That's why Bryan Stevenson is one of my real life heroes https://t.co/2NziDKgV8G Speaking of my current favorite track!  \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/6zjwE69ld7 I'll pay her handsomely.  I still owe her from the Stereo video the day I met her https://t.co/ypnOuRbEc9 This album is full of love, hope, and soul.  After I wrote the song #BiggerLove with @RyanTedder and @Cautiousclayton I knew that it felt like an album title that captured the spirit of the music https://t.co/QGZNKg9wgA Koffee is so dope.  Great voice and flow. I think she's the youngest Grammy winner for best reggae album!  She's the present and the future. So glad to have her on the album https://t.co/e37yc75pE3 It changes all the time. Right now, it's Remember Us feat. @rapsody. The music, the vibe, the nostalgia and rapsody's perfect verse are doing it for me right now https://t.co/P0MeEpUC0x We're postponing til next year.

But every time I think about releasing something, I want to top all my old songs with new ones. But maybe one day... https://t.co/TFrmwCVjIm Ever since we could email each other big audio files (quite a few years ago), a lot of us have had long distance collaborations so it wasn't a big leap to do it during the quarantine. I sang a demo into my phone for Jhene mapping out her duet vocals, &amp; she recorded them perfectly https://t.co/FyW7j2SUIt @Natalieimani.  She's a wonderful singer. She tours with me in my band and also makes her own solo records https://t.co/0WCxAfceAH I wrote this one in a great session with Mr Hudson, Greg Wells and Nasri.  It probably took a few hours to write. It was one of the earlier songs I wrote for this album, but it feels even more needed and poignant now https://t.co/yA42UQo5k6 I almost always write the music first. The lyrics flow from the music for me. I know some artists do it the opposite way though https://t.co/6UXHCORTON Chrissy's French onion soup! \ud83d\ude0b @chrissyteigen @cravings https://t.co/4hjVVlCsCN Every album is unique.

I\u2019ve got your Father\u2019s Day plans covered. Join my family and friends on Sunday, June 21st for #JohnLegendFathersDay at 8|7c on @ABCNetwork! #BiggerLove https://t.co/HsDHI2Gaou A week from today, on June 19, I invite you to experience a #BiggerLove. I debuted in 2004 with an album called Get Lifted.  And now, as we enter the summer of 2020, I hope this new album can get you lifted again, fill your hearts with love and inspiration, give you something to dance to, something to hold hands to, something to make love to. I\u2019m under no illusion that music can save the world or solve the world\u2019s problems, but I\u2019ve always turned to music to help me through tough times and I know many of you have done the same.  That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t wait to release this album to the world. But It\u2019s important for us to continue to show the world the fullness of what it is to be black &amp; human. Through our art, we are able to do that. This album is a celebration of love, joy, sensuality, hope, &amp; resilience, the things that make our culture so beautiful &amp; influential. Lately, the images of black people in the media have been showing us with knees on our necks, in mourning, or expressing our collective outrage.  We feel all those emotions. All of these songs were created prior to the world being rocked by a pandemic, prior to the latest police killings in the U.S. that sent so many to the streets in protest.  During these painful times, some of us may wonder if it\u2019s ok to laugh or dance or be romantic. The songs are inspired by the loves of my life:  my wife, my family and the rich tradition of black music that has made me the artist I am. This project has been a labor of love for me, something I\u2019ve spent over a year conceiving and creating.  I poured my heart and soul into these songs and collaborated with some incredibly gifted co-writers, producers and musicians. I\u2019m so excited to introduce my new album #BiggerLove to the world.  Here\u2019s the album cover painted by brilliant artist Charly Palmer.  Check out the track list, including my amazing featured guests. https://t.co/nWu6Y2JhRH I support #TeamJoe because this nightmare of a presidency needs to end.

We got the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States of America to promo a @ShermansShow song #AddSomeKente https://t.co/3u5tvmePQ4 Everyone was saying $15 minimum wage and Medicare for All and gay marriage were also unrealistic and ridiculous but activists moved the conversation and pushed politicians toward progress It's not the job of grass roots activists on the left to craft political messaging for mainstream democratic candidates. I'm almost 100% sure Biden won't be tweeting #DefundThePolice.  It's the job of activists to push these politicians toward meaningful change. \"defund\" is the word because it says we're taking away some funding from one budget item and moving it to higher priorities. \"reform\" or \"retrain\" does not at all suggest the same thing. We've been supposedly doing the latter for decades This doesn't mean there will be no police; it means there should be significantly fewer police and more professionals of other types with expertise in their fields, whether it's social work, health care, conflict resolution, drug treatment, etc Whenever there are budget cuts, those \"softer\" services are on the chopping block first.  And, since we know we're not solving the underlying problems, we figure we better keep a huge police force to contain them.  Let's resolve to do differently.  Let's imagine a healthier world And that choice comes at a cost. We defund housing support, health care, education and child care, the arts, drug treatment, community centers, all sorts of services that would actually reduce the problems that we ask the police to surveil and contain Police funding takes up a huge portion of our local budgets. Budgets are moral documents which spell out in black and white what our priorities are. We have finite amounts of money to spend and right now we spend far too much on policing Some intentionally want to cast the argument in extremes like that so they can score political points. But I ask that those of you who are reasonable and actually care about making this country healthy and safe for all people engage with the thoughtful arguments in this piece I know this word \"defund\" has caused some controversy, even from some who are inclined to agree with a lot of the underlying arguments.

Hi \"bruh\" Preservers of the status quo will always try to equate protesting with violence so that they can change the narrative from the systemic and immediate causes of these very legitimate, predominantly peaceful protests. Don't fall for it.  These protests were caused by state violence Excellent question. Perhaps you should ask the police because THEY DO IT ALL THE TIME.  Ask any activist advocating for marginalized groups.  That's why these legal aid and bailout funds are prepared to deal with this. They're used to it. Some of you think that supporting a bailout fund means we're supporting people who intentionally harm people or destroy property because \"why would the police arrest and jail peaceful protestors?\" @AndrewYang Take away police funding and reroute it towards community needs (like health care, maybe a UBI!) Prevent crime through community edification.  Let's stop trying to solve problems by hiring more law enforcement Please stay as safe as you can. There is still a deadly virus that thrives on people being really close to each other. Distance as much as possible and wear a mask to protect yourself and others! Americans have the first amendment right to peacefully protest oppression and injustice. Chrissy and I will be donating to these 3 organizations which are organizing, supporting and defending those marching for justice:  @Mvmnt4BlkLives @nlgnews @bailproject https://t.co/whxOPQQuTu If you think whatever bad conditions in your community would be solved by more police, consider the possibility of spending that same money on schools, health care, drug addiction treatment, housing support.  We do everything ass-backwards Meanwhile, billions of dollars of exploitation, fraud and other white collar crime happens with no arrests, no police involvement, nothing. We need to divest in our entire system of overincarceration and overpolicing. We are not made safer or closer to justice by any of it. Consider the fact that 4 police officers responded to the alleged use of a $20 counterfeit bill. Do we have too many police officers or too few? This young woman was killed in her home for no reason.  We don't have a video, but it still happened.

We don't need to lock people up for any of this stuff. Her sentence shouldn't be fewer years. It should be ZERO. It's unconscionable that we locked a woman up for voting when, unbeknownst to her, she was ineligible. It's insane we locked a woman up for 5 years for sending her kid to the wrong school district.  Literally everyone involved in that decision should be ashamed of themselves Americans have become desensitized to how much we lock people up.  Prisons and jails are not the answer to every bad thing everyone does, but we've come to use them to address nearly every societal ill. I get why everyone gets mad when rich person X gets a short sentence and poor person of color Y gets a long one. The answer isn't for X to get more; it's for both of them to get less (or even none!!!)

This is all just conversation and a way of affirming and critiquing certain behavior and values. I think it's a worthy discussion if it influences people to think about the impact of their actions (in business, politics and philanthropy) on society @maxvan00 @secupp I'm gonna take a hard pass on looking to the 19th century for when America was at its greatest @rootb3er @MeredthSalenger @secupp Different Kochs. Same spelling, different family @PeterFManning3 @secupp He answers to billionaires like....the Kochs! @DWesJr @secupp Cool, bro @pmtisariddle @secupp If I ever run for office, I certainly will.  Still waiting for POTUS's \"audit\" to be over, I assume? @secupp Democracy is most certainly messy and imperfect but depending on the largesse and pet interests of unaccountable oligarchs is a far worse option. @secupp *unaccountable @secupp Trust has to be earned. But at least the people get to vote on politicians every 2-6 years. It'd be nice if those elections were free of unaccounted billionaires tipping the scale. @secupp And I'm pretty sure people have been criticizing him pretty loudly for at least the past decade. @secupp It may not matter, honestly.  But I think a lot of these guys care about their legacy. Maybe the ones who are still alive will see this and do better. Maybe they'll at least attempt to do more good than harm in the world. @secupp How many Medicaid expansion refusers did he fund? How many politicians who wanted to strip healthcare from millions did he fund?  He could have invested his money in making healthcare more accessible to the poor and working class.  He did the opposite. @secupp At least politicians have to answer to the people. At least when there aren't billionaires actively funding anti-democratic efforts like voter suppression and gerrymandering. Thanks again, Koch Brothers. @secupp I think we'll never agree on the role of government.  You'll always prefer less than I do. I get that. But I'd rather rely on democratically-elected officials than an unaccountable billionaire to set priorities and fund public goods. @JonTrotterEsq @secupp We can all debate the moral implications of everyone's political acts.  Part of your opinion will be based on your own priorities and values.  But let's at least be clear-eyed and examine the facts of what he advocated for and the real-life effects of the policies he championed. @secupp When you work so hard to avoid paying taxes that could go to fund things like education, the arts and infrastructure, spare me the celebration of your donation to the arts. @secupp For instance, when you spend so much to support politicians who want to strip health insurance from people, IDGAF about the money you spend on cancer research.  People without health insurance can't access that amazing research anyway. @secupp I don't celebrate his death. But I most certainly don't celebrate his life. @secupp He spent a decent amount fighting for crim justice reform too.  It's a cause I care about deeply.  People are complicated.  But I have to say that the net effect of the Koch brothers' activism is highly negative and I don't think it's that close of a call. @secupp It's not a lack of attention I'm concerned about. It's active attention towards destructive political aims. @HighArchmage @secupp @MIT @AnandWrites Word. He spends significant time on the Sacklers' story. @secupp @MIT When you spend so much $ and influence to dismantle the state and destroy the planet, it really isn't enough to donate even millions to offset that damage.  @AnandWrites wrote a great book re: this called Winners Take All.

But this bill won't pass the GOP Senate and Trump wont sign. How about Dems unilaterally vow to voluntarily follow a certain anti-corruption code even if it's not the law of the land. @jDorai Both parties should. You're right. But the Democrats claim to be the party of the people. GOP makes it clear their main goal is lowering taxes for the rich and deregulating corporations.  Democrats should back up their brand with actions that make it clear who they stand with Democrats should make it their policy to truly drain the swamp. Show that you can't be bought.  Show that you are making policy with no ulterior motives.  Make that a core part of the brand Everybody's retweeting this. But it really is great.

I'm friends with the #SurvivingRKelly director and several protestors in the #MuteRKelly movement so I had a personal connection and agreed to appear. I don't just go around interviewing for every expos\u00e9. This is dumb @tariqnasheed I'm glad you agree with me that R deserves the Weinstein treatment. Believe the victims, expose the rampant predatory behavior, career destruction and indictment with convictions hopefully in the future. @DreMicheals1 Weinstein has been exposed. His career is destroyed, he's ostracized from the business  and will never make a movie again.  He's charged with sexual assault and is awaiting trial. If you want the same for R, then great!  Me too. @BluBell17 We have never collabed. Ever. @BluBell17 Please show me the songs I made with him. Google really hard. They don't exist. If y'all wanna cape for R and discount all these women's stories, just say it. Don't bring up some old pics of me and somebody else. https://t.co/2wus2P7vNm I took a photo with and worked with Harvey on several occasions before his abuse was known to me and the rest of the world.  Since his being exposed, his company and career have rightfully been destroyed and he's been indicted. Sounds like something that should happen to R Kelly https://t.co/LgIOQpEnsP @dh_simba7 @JT_theQB4th Congratulations on a phenomenal season!  On to the next challenge! @mason_patty Love you back!  Just believe that pundits' opinions should represent a wider range of the diversity of the populace.

It is, in part, fueled by the rhetoric of demagogues who scare people about brown people and Jews. Some of those demagogues are on prime time on Fox News, getting ad dollars from mainstream corps @NateSilver538 The logical endpoint of anything moderate could be something extreme. A silly reason to not do that moderate thing. @NateSilver538 Slippery slope arguments are too easy. Executives can make decisions about what kind of speech goes too far and shouldn't be supported by ad dollars.

That is a position of high honor and extreme privilege. He has the right to not be criminally convicted and locked up without convincing evidence. It's a different standard. @Yi_Dav2016 @secupp Well, you could understand him lying about, say, sexually assualting someone. But lying about getting very drunk is ridiculous and unnecessary.  All these beers and underage drinking and you never went too far?  Obvious bullshit. @mikedaitch @MICKGUILFOYLE @secupp My belief that the government shouldn't have power over a woman's uterus is very much a moral issue. My belief that a supreme Court Justice shouldn't be a liar and sexual assualter: also moral @TallManShort @US395 @secupp Dr Ford is not absurd and her accusations clearly weren't. Did you watch her testimony? @liberalnotlefty @KLMcFilth @DestructiveChem @secupp These are the sorts of details the FBI investigates to help flesh out the facts and assess the credibility of the accusations.  GOP doesn't want the investigation because they're afraid of the truth. @liberalnotlefty @KLMcFilth @DestructiveChem @secupp Dr Ford came forward before Kavanaugh was even picked, when he was on a short list. That timeline is critical. It shows the party wasn't paying or inciting her to come forward. She knew he had integrity issues and didn't want him to be picked from the shortlist. @MICKGUILFOYLE @secupp The rape question goes to his credibility, integrity, temperament. It's not a criminal case. There is no beyond a reasonable doubt standard. @MICKGUILFOYLE @secupp It is not a criminal prosecution of a rape claim. This is not a rape case. It's a job interview to decide whether or not Kavanaugh should get a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land. A position that gives him power over all of our lives @US395 @secupp Trump promised he would pick judges that would overturn RvW. He said women should be punished.  And the federalist society is committed to overturning as well.  So are we supposed to believe that Kavanaugh was picked and won't carry out their plan? @liberalnotlefty @KLMcFilth @DestructiveChem @secupp We dont know the extent of the evidence because the claims haven't been investigated. They should be investigated @DestructiveChem @secupp Real, actual, sentient human beings have said they were victims of Kavanaugh and his cronies. The Democratic party didn't make this up. If you want to call the women liars, just say it. @DestructiveChem @secupp Dr Ford accused him with clarity and credibility. The Democratic party didn't. @DestructiveChem @secupp Are you calling Dr Ford a liar?  Did she make all of this up? @JustMaintain @secupp It's about all of it @secupp And the fact that this person who made all of these \"boys will be boys\" mistakes as a teenager can now have the power to force a teenage girl to carry a pregnancy to term is downright terrifying. @secupp I hate his politics. But I'm also resigned to the fact that a conservative without integrity issues will make it to the court, just like Gorsuch did. Kavanaugh is a terrible choice even among conservatives I clearly disagree with @secupp And I don't think we've ever seen a court nominee display such disdain for the other political party. He obviously can't be even remotely impartial. @secupp He lied about his involvement in Bush policy decisions and judge nomination campaigns. He most likely lied about the extent of his drinking and other things he could have admitted to. He's not to be trusted. @secupp The biggest problem with him is that he's lied multiple times before the senate, sometimes about things he needn't lie about. @JasonBrandon8 So we pick based on who's most qualified now? What does that even mean really Raise your hand if you believe there's even a tiny chance Kavanaugh has never had so much to drink that he didn't remember some of the night's events.  He's obviously a liar. People keep saying it's not in the Constitution. That's why we have amendments.  The Constitution can change.  The founding fathers weren't divine. @raythemaverick I'm saying the Constitution is wrong on this point. I know what it says. I know that it's completely ridiculous in the real world too @Aftermath8 The founding fathers aren't divine. They fucked up on this one, among other things And obviously the senate needs to be dramatically changed.  California's representation vs Wyoming is a travesty I haven't workshopped this but it ain't crazy. It's like best actor and best actress categories. We should have a man and a woman representing each district and state to guarantee 50/50 representation. I believe Dr Ford.

If we want to prevent evil we need to at least confront the realities that led to it. People don't commit crimes because liberals are too soft to call them animals. @OluwaSirdam We are the product of a bunch of decisions, including plenty of our own.  But we all have parents, neighborhoods, governments, etc. whose decisions help shape our future too. @Beard__Chase no, I'm saying some innocent children grow up to be gang members.  do you dispute this obvious fact? @KentBrockman13 nope.  but they're human. nazis were humans.  kkk members human.  the people who do the absolute worst things are still human.  calling them animals may make us feel better.  doesn't make it true. Dehumanizing large groups of people is the demagogue's precursor to visiting violence and pain upon them. It makes it easier to destroy their families and much worse. And we should particularly interrogate the role of American policy in helping to make MS-13 the organization it is now. But it's much more honest and challenging to realize they were all babies once and think about what in society, their home life, etc took them from baby to violent gang member. And then to think about collective action we could take to mitigate these conditions Even human beings who commit heinous acts are the same species as us, not \"animals\".

You can show me all the individuals you want. I'm sure they are wonderful people. The NRA's agenda is to sell more guns and stop any meaningful gun safety measures. You are a danger to America. You are a danger to law enforcement. https://t.co/yIAbotNU8i and it was FANTASTIC https://t.co/EY85FWxktO We did not, however, talk about my new single.  Did I mention I had a new single?  haha. #AGoodNight We discussed the infamous text exchange, why policy matters, why black people tend to vote for Democrats, the history behind our party loyalty (hint:  we ain't slaves), and how we can remember our history and still be fly. Had an excellent conversation with my brother @ebrointheAM!  Listen to all of it here!  https://t.co/WxCZ5bGEBm @BernardKerik @majority4_trump @NRA Police in nations without our addiction to guns almost never have to worry about being shot. And they rarely resort to shooting civilians. The NRA's only mission is to sell more guns. They are dangerous to police. Spent an amazing evening with Kiehl\u2019s celebrating the launch of their sustainability platform last night! Follow @Kiehls and #KiehlsMadeBetter to find out more soon. #KiehlsPartner https://t.co/n5HjDCPAGK Just like Trump to slap his name on something someone else built and take credit for it. I know fact free thought is a major pillar of maga but here's a little chart showing how black unemployment went down dramatically under Obama (after Dubya's financial meltdown) and has continued going down a little under Trump. So we do thank our President Obama for this! https://t.co/Nl0ySJkUt4 Based on the flood of maga in my mentions, they think Trump saved America's economy. And that black folks, in particular, should be grateful to our racist president for our low unemployment rate Hope to see you as Georgia's next governor! https://t.co/4MEiwa8jVP I believe in redemption for the formerly incarcerated. But quite odd that he would choose to lecture me on respect for the law. https://t.co/ndCIxzyexI I wonder what makes life more difficult for police. That we have so many guns per capita in America or me being upset when cops get away with murder.  The NRA is a danger to this nation and to the police. https://t.co/dn1NfFLhIP @beaburns @kanyewest @chrissyteigen Google Pixel @jfreewright Well deserved, brother! RT @JulianCastro: This Administration wants everybody to sacrifice except themselves. Chartered jets, first class seats, extravagant dining\u2026 King James!!! And I'mma retweet this ad because I need a break from this shit https://t.co/m7m4n8rcAE Anyway, y'all need to come to Montgomery and see this memorial The defining trait of Trump's campaign and political profile was his embrace of white supremacy.  He made it clear every time he spoke. Some serious cognitive dissonance to ignore that for the other x% you might find appealing. I guess I agree with &gt;1% of anyone's thoughts though I love that great, brilliant artists have the power to imagine a better future. But artists can't be blind to the truth. They see the statistics about black applications for real estate or loans or employment being turned away because their name was Jamal and not James They know their family was destroyed by deportation or incarceration. They know their loved one was denied safe harbor because of their religion. They know their son or daughter was shot because their skin color evoked fear Far too many people don't have the luxury of closing their eyes and ears. They feel it in their lives and can't act like what they see and know doesn't exist. I imagine there's some comfort in imagining a future without racism and projecting that onto the present. Thinking if we just deny the truth, it doesn't exist. If history is erased, we don't have to deal with its consequences. However...
