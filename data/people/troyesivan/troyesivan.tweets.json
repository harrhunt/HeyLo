Okayyyyyyy I\u2019m done n never talking about this again bc my parents read this stuff and i feel weird. love to all There\u2019s no shame in anal sex or any kind of sex - i just don\u2019t want to talk about it over the phone to a complete stranger I highly doubt anyone would ask any of my straight peers explicit questions about who does what to who in their relationship, no matter the content of their music. I don\u2019t think artists should have to expect to be asked about that when they show up to work in the morning I speak about sex in my music on my terms, when I\u2019m in control, and writing music that is going to be close to my heart forever. That does not open the flood gates + give anyone a pass on basic manners and allow them to ask about the ins and outs of what i do in bed Firstly, Bloom is an album about love. I said that in every single interview i did about the album. Suggesting that i made the entire album about bottoming is over sexualising me + my work, and is reductive Last I\u2019ll say on this, but disappointing to see that @outmagazine, an LGBT publication, was the only one to miss the mark so much on the reporting of this https://t.co/vEgSnIm7Q5 Lol nooooo don\u2019t NZ is my fave and i can\u2019t wait to get there https://t.co/dLSrjUO9Em You sure you don\u2019t wanna just ask if i have a gayby or if i like Will and Grace like the other guy??? https://t.co/Gi8JNCuJoK Next time I\u2019ll just do a Twitter q&amp;a I thought about asking the interviewer about his absolute fave sex position after that last question, but then i remembered how wildly invasive, strange and innapropriate that would be.
