For one example, see: https://t.co/hV6Fw8Rue9 @Owens_Juninho @UN @OSIRISREx Studying asteroids like Bennu help scientists understand how planets formed and how life began, as well as improve our understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth. More info: https://t.co/5cLpwxHrbz @Owens_Juninho @UN Bennu only poses a very small (0.037%) total chance of impact in the future, and the @OSIRISREx mission is closely studying Bennu. @sadhanathiru_ @UN Asteroid mining may be possible in the future. Some asteroids are thought to contain organic elements, and may have supplied those to the planets early in solar system history. But asteroids are not usually thought to be naturally habitable. #AsteroidDay @AndarKiAwaaz @UN A second interstellar object, 2I/Borisov, was discovered in 2019. There are calculations suggesting there is always an interstellar object moving through the inner solar system, if we knew where to look! #AsteroidDay @QueenEmmaHawaii @UN Objects are classified by international agreement, based on orbital and physical characteristics. An object may seem to fit more than one classification, but typically has only one official classification. https://t.co/q2hKzBaVMb #AsteroidDay @Luco65 @AsteroidWatch @UN DART doesn\u2019t detect asteroids. However, we're formulating the Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveillance mission, which will survey the sky for NEOs in the infrared, with a goal of finding 90% of NEOs larger than 140m in diameter. #AsteroidDay @YuLin_Langtso @UN To deflect larger asteroids, more massive impactors would be needed, but these, as well as other methods, like nuclear explosive devices for deflection, and gravity tractors, are possible with existing technologies, given enough time to prepare the missions. @YuLin_Langtso @UN Yes, and we'll demonstrate this, on a small scale, with the DART mission to change the orbit of the satellite of the asteroid Didymos. @Quantum59026601 @UN Of the near-Earth asteroids larger than 140 meters in size, there are about \u2154 of the predicted 25,000 remaining to be found. #AsteroidDay @rohankumar___ @UN Commercial mining is not quite viable yet, but may be in the future. Yes, a careful economic approach would need to be taken to avoid negative effects on the market. #AsteroidDay @goodendofkings @UN The key is the minimum time, ideally years to decades, to give plenty of time to launch an asteroid deflection mission, which is why discovering and tracking asteroids is critical. #AsteroidDay @MackerelPhones @UN Some technologies already exist that can deflect an asteroid from colliding with Earth. Whether those technologies will be useful or not depends on the amount of warning time and the asteroid size. The more time we have, the more options we have! #AsteroidDay @NicoleMHoneycut @UN The more measurements of an asteroids position we have, the better we can predict its future path. With enough data, we can predict future positions to within a few hundred km or better. #AsteroidDay @elmurpheytv @UN All asteroids travel faster than a speeding bullet! The slowest ones may travel at only 4 or 5 miles per second, but the fastest ones are over 40 miles per second relative to Earth. #AsteroidDay @Ascendor @AsteroidWatch @UN The largest known object in the Main Asteroid Belt is the dwarf planet Ceres, which is about 580 mi (940 km) in diameter. It can be seen with a small telescope along with many others between Mars and Jupiter. #AsteroidDay @AntiSquid1 @UN The key to planetary defense is finding them first. We have the technology to find any hazardous asteroid years to decades - even centuries before they could impact which then would provide plenty of time to divert them from impacting Earth. #AsteroidDay @EyuChyu @AsteroidWatch @UN The key is the minimum time, ideally years to decades, to give plenty of time to launch an asteroid deflection mission, which is why discovering and tracking asteroids is critical. #AsteroidDay @Iwillnotfall @UN We're working to discover and track near-Earth asteroids so that there would be enough time to prepare - up to years to decades - should any pose an impact threat. #AsteroidDay @alinaillmeeer1 @UN Asteroids tend to spend most of their time millions of miles from Earth. Even during brief close passes to Earth the closest are still thousands of miles away. #AsteroidDay @_vedantpatel @UN Meteors are the flashes we see in the sky made from incoming objects. Pieces of asteroids that make it to the ground are called meteorites. #AsteroidDay @Jaspartapsingh3 @UN Apophis will safely pass Earth on April 13, 2029 at about one tenth the distance to the Moon, or approximately 38,000 km. Studying that will help assess if it poses any future concern. #AsteroidDay @spencergoldade @UN Deflecting an asteroid will no longer be sci-fi once our Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission completes its technology demonstration of asteroid kinetic impactor deflection in 2022! #AsteroidDay @NotSolhi @UN Near-Earth asteroids come within 30 million miles of Earth\u2019s orbit and travel at roughly 30 km/s in their orbits around the Sun. #AsteroidDay @nitin_quiry @UN Every day is #AsteroidDay for our team! Asteroid search programs discover objects every single day, including today. @Empath_Witch_RN @UN Unlikely, most asteroids are orbitally bound within the solar system. #AsteroidDay @Prakash251998 @UN This depends on the exact size of the asteroid and the amount of warning time we have, which makes early detection very important! The sooner we find an asteroid, the more time we have to mitigate it. #AsteroidDay @caseywhalen57 @UN Yes, some asteroids contain iron, nickel and possibly other metals including some platinum group metals. #AsteroidDay @rohankumar___ @UN We're developing the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission which will test the kinetic impactor deflection technique by impacting Dimorphos, the moon of asteroid Didymos, in 2022. #AsteroidDay @rohankumar___ @UN The bigger asteroids are, the fewer there are and the easier they are to find.
