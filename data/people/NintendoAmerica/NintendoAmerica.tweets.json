We anticipate it may be a while, though, as good science takes time. Until then, we hope players continue to enjoy #Splatoon2. Keep up the squid research, everyone! Classic main weapons appear viable in the Splatlands, although their appearance seems evolved to suit this unique culture. The .96 Gal and Range Blaster look markedly different than we\u2019re used to, which will seemingly make them stand out more from other weapons of the same type. https://t.co/bdDGpdNp2C In the video transmission, we also spotted some special weapons! In addition to a brand-new one, some seem like reconfigured versions of special weapons found in Inkopolis. How perfectly fitting for the city of chaos\u2026 https://t.co/2tXIF471ae We\u2019ve also discovered a new weapon with a shape like a bow. It looks a bit primitive at first glance, but on closer inspection, it\u2019s packed with technology, including a mechanism capable of launching three strings of ink simultaneously! https://t.co/u2pOjLwqgt We\u2019ve identified two new ways that Inklings can move. A \u201csquid roll\u201d allows them to leap and twirl out of their ink, and a \u201csquid surge\u201d allows them to quickly swim up ink-covered walls and jump out at the top! Just think how these abilities could be used in the heat of battle\u2026 https://t.co/5NwwJZSnwr In the Splatlands, Inklings seem to favor entering the battlefield by launching themselves out of some sort of midair spawner drone. It appears they can even choose their landing spot before flying into action! https://t.co/ISsBcDl5nH Even in the Splatlands, Inklings seem devoted to the popular pastime of Turf War. The basic rules appear unchanged\u2014two teams of four compete to ink the most ground. However, the denizens of Splatsville appear to have taken their battles into the surrounding wilds of nature! https://t.co/4PUVUi8t1W We\u2019ve learned that Splatsville is located in a broader region called the Splatlands. It seems the intense sun and harsh environment have had a profound effect on its inhabitants. In recent years, trendsetting Inklings have been drawn to this culture like moths to a Bunsen burner! https://t.co/NgChjFFMhl Here we see Splatsville, the newly discovered \u201ccity of chaos.\u201d It has a dated feel yet seems densely populated. Research indicates that Splatsville\u2019s development has accelerated rapidly since the Final Splatfest a year and a half ago, even though it\u2019s located far from Inkopolis. https://t.co/9ufNURlsf8 In the new video transmission, an Inkling is seen accompanied by a juvenile Salmonid called a Smallfry. Our studies have long shown the Salmonids to be a dangerous species. How this seemingly symbiotic relationship evolved is a thrilling mystery. Further research is required! https://t.co/NXeTYkhk8m It\u2019s no secret that Inklings and Octolings can arrange their head tentacles in various \u201chairstyles.\u201d However, it seems these wonderful creatures are capable of more intricate designs than previously known. Just look at this Inkling\u2026 It has a braid! What a day for science. https://t.co/PJS7eVbaTu Attention, worldwide squid researchers!\n\n#Splatoon3 was just announced via video transmission. It doesn\u2019t launch for some time, but we learned some fascinating ecological details: a new Inkling &amp; Octoling habitat has been discovered! And it seems quite different than Inkopolis... https://t.co/7YGu7qqUZR Venture into a hand-crafted solar system and unravel the mysteries of the universe when the critically acclaimed #OuterWilds comes to #NintendoSwitch this summer! #NintendoDirect @Mobius_Games https://t.co/O5Z5Y8N139 #Splatoon3 arrives on #NintendoSwitch in 2022!
