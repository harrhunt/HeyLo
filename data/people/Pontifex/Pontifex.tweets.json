{"tweets": "May we not let this time of grace pass in vain, in the foolish illusion that we can control the times and means of our conversion to the Lord! #Lent How many times have we told the Lord: \u201cLord, I will come to you later... I can\u2019t come today. Tomorrow I will begin to pray and do something for others\u201d. In this life, we will always have things to do and excuses to offer, but right now is the time to return to God. #Lent For us believers, \u201csister water\u201d is not merchandise: it is a universal symbol and is the source of life and health. Many brothers and sisters have access to too little and perhaps polluted water. It is necessary to assure potable water and hygienic services to all. #WorldWaterDay \u201cUnless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit\u201d (Jn 12:23-24). Precisely then, in trials and in solitude while the seed is dying, that is the moment in which life blossoms, to bear ripe fruit in due time Every child who a woman expects in her womb is a gift that changes a family\u2019s history: the life of fathers and mothers, grandparents and of brothers and sisters. That child needs to be welcomed, loved and nurtured. Always! #WorldDownSyndromeDay Racism is a virus that quickly mutates and, instead of disappearing, goes into hiding, and lurks in waiting. Instances of racism continue to shame us, for they show that our supposed social progress is not as real or definitive as we think. #FightRacism #FratelliTutti Each day that begins, if welcomed in #prayer, is accompanied by courage, so that the problems we have to face no longer seem to be obstacles to our #happiness, but rather appeals from God, opportunities for our encounter with him. #WorldHappinessDay To be a good father means to offer everything, holding nothing back; to protect without suffocating; to pardon without asking anything in return; to wait patiently and trustingly. It means following the example of the \"Good Father\" who is in heaven. May God bless all fathers! Saint Joseph is an outstanding example of acceptance of God\u2019s plans. May he help everyone, especially young people who are discerning, to make God\u2019s dreams for them come true. #Vocations https://t.co/n7BhguDUoI I pray that every family may feel the living presence of the Holy Family of Nazareth in their own home, that they may fill our small domestic communities with sincere and generous love, a source of joy even in trials and difficulties. #AmorisLaetitia https://t.co/ku78PZroiC To experience #Lent in hope means receiving the hope of Christ, who gave his life on the cross and was raised by God on the third day, and always being prepared to make a defence to anyone who calls us to account for our hope (1 Pt 3,15). With great sorrow, I must recall the dramatic situation in #Myanmar, where many people, especially young people, are losing their lives to offer hope to their country. I too kneel in the streets of Myanmar and say: End the violence! May dialogue prevail! The Holy Spirit writes the history of the Church and of the world. We are open books, willing to receive his handwriting. And in each of us the Spirit composes original works, because there is never one Christian who is completely identical to another. #GeneralAudience In these days of uncertainty about our future, in our charity may we speak works of reassurance and help others to realise that God loves them as sons and daughters. #Lent To experience #Lent with love means caring for those who suffer or feel abandoned and fearful because of the #Covid-19 pandemic. Ten years ago, the bloody conflict in Syria began that has caused one of the most serious humanitarian catastrophes. Let us #PrayTogether so that all the suffering experienced by beloved and tortured Syria might not be forgotten and so that our solidarity might revive their hope. Dear brothers and sisters from the #Philippines, five hundred years have passed since the Christian message first arrived in your land and you received the joy of the Gospel.  And this joy is evident in your people. Thank you for the joy you bring to the whole world! If God so loves us that he gives himself to us, the Church too has this mission. She is not sent to judge but to welcome; not to impose, but to sow; not to condemn, but to bring Christ who is our salvation. https://t.co/f6I43aD74X In Jesus, God went in search of us where we were lost. In Jesus, he came to raise us up when we fell. In Jesus, he wept with us and healed our wounds. In Jesus, he blessed our life forever. #Laetare #Lent is about discerning where our hearts are directed. Let us ask: Where is my life\u2019s navigation system taking me \u2013 towards God or towards myself? By receiving forgiveness in the Sacrament of Reconciliation, that is the heart of our process of conversion, we spread forgiveness. Having received forgiveness, we can offer it through attentive dialogue and giving comfort to those experiencing sorrow and pain. #Lent I encourage you to dedicate time to the Word of God, to the Sacraments, and to fasting and prayer, in order to renew our relationship with God, ourselves, and our neighbor. #Lent #24hoursfortheLord The beginning of the return to God is the recognition of our need for him and his mercy. This is the right path, the path of humility. #Lent #24hoursfortheLord All of us have spiritual infirmities that we cannot heal on our own. We need Jesus\u2019 healing, we need to present our wounds to him and say: \u201cJesus, I am in your presence, with my sin, with my sorrows. You can set me free. Heal my heart\u201d. #Lent A message of fraternity came from Erbil as well, the city in which I was received by the President of the autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan, @IKRPresident, and its Prime Minister, by the Authorities and by the people. I thank the dear Kurdish population for their warm welcome. I am grateful to the religious Authorities as well, beginning with the Grand Ayatollah Al-Sistani, with whom I had an unforgettable meeting. May God, who is peace, grant a future of fraternity to Iraq, the Middle East and the entire world! After my Visit in #Iraq, I am filled with gratitude to God and to all those who made it possible: the President of the Republic, @BarhamSalih, and the Government, the Patriarchs and Bishops. Thinking of the many Iraqis who have emigrated, I would like to say to them: you have left everything, like Abraham; like him, keep the faith and hope and be weavers of friendship and of fraternity wherever you are. And if you can, return. #Iraq #GeneralAudience Let us continue to pray for Iraq and for the Middle East. Despite the destruction, in #Iraq, the palm, the country's symbol, has continued to grow and bear fruit. So it is for fraternity: it does not make noise, but is fruitful and grows. #GeneralAudience #PrayTogether The response to war is not another war. The response to weapons is not other weapons. The response is fraternity. This is the challenge not only for Iraq. It is the challenge for many regions in conflict and, ultimately, for the entire world. #Peace #GeneralAudience #Lent is a journey that involves our whole life, our entire being. It is a time to reconsider the path we are taking, to find the route that leads us home and to rediscover our profound relationship with God, on whom everything depends. Iraq will always remain in my heart. I ask all of you, dear brothers and sisters, to work together, united for a future of peace and prosperity that leaves no one behind and discriminates against no one. I assure you of my prayers for this beloved country. #ApostolicJourney I would like to say a heartfelt thank you to all the women, especially the women of #Iraq, courageous women who continue to give life, in spite of wrongs and hurts. May women be respected and protected! May they be shown respect and provided with opportunities! #ApostolicJourney Today, I can see at first hand that the Church in Iraq is alive, that Christ is alive and at work in this, his holy and faithful people. #ApostolicJourney #Iraq https://t.co/VpbIOt9trA \u201cDestroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up\u201d (Jn 2:19). Jesus was speaking about the temple of his body, and about the Church as well. By the power of his Resurrection he can raise our communities from the ruins left by hatred. #ApostolicJourney #Iraq God can bring peace to this land.  We trust in him and, together with all people of good will, we say \u201cno\u201d to terrorism and the manipulation of religion. #ApostolicJourney #Iraq Fraternity is more durable than fratricide, hope is more powerful than hatred, peace more powerful than war. This conviction can never be silenced by the blood spilled by those who pervert the name of God to pursue paths of destruction. #ApostolicJourney #Iraq Lord, to you we entrust all those whose span of earthly life was cut short by the violent hand of their brothers and sisters; we also pray to you for those who caused such harm. May they repent, touched by the power of your mercy. https://t.co/QwcnOiABcX Love is our strength, strength of so many brothers and sisters who here too have suffered prejudice and indignities, mistreatment and persecutions for the name of Jesus. #ApostolicJourney #Iraq https://t.co/igMBv943ys To be blessed, we do not need to become occasional heroes, but witnesses day after day. Witness is the way to embody the wisdom of Jesus. That is how the world is changed: not by power and might, but by the Beatitudes. #ApostolicJourney #Iraq Almighty God, our Creator, you love our human family, we, children of Abraham, ask you to welcome into your abode of peace and light all victims of violence and war. #ApostolicJourney #Iraq  https://t.co/uBO9fzqEqd It is up to us, today\u2019s humanity, especially believers, to turn instruments of hatred into instruments of #peace, to appeal firmly to the leaders of nations to make the increasing proliferation of arms give way to the distribution of food for all. #ApostolicJourney #Iraq Where does the journey of peace begin? From the decision not to have enemies. Anyone who believes in God, has no enemies to fight.  He or she has only one enemy to face, one that stands at the door of the heart and knocks to enter: it is hatred.  #ApostolicJourney #Iraq #Peace does not demand winners or losers, but brothers and sisters who, despite past hurts, journey from conflict to unity.  Let us ask for this in praying for the whole Middle East, especially for war-torn Syria. #ApostolicJourney #Iraq Let us remember our brothers and sisters who have paid the extreme price for their fidelity to the Lord. May their sacrifice inspire us to renew our trust in the strength of the Cross and its saving message of forgiveness, reconciliation and rebirth #ApostolicJourney #Iraq Only if we succeed in regarding each other, with our differences, as members of the same human family, can we begin an effective process of reconstruction and leave a better, more just and more human world to the future generations. #ApostolicJourney #Iraq I come as a penitent, asking forgiveness from Heaven and our brothers for so much destruction and cruelty; a pilgrim of peace, in the name of Christ, Prince of Peace. How we have prayed, in these years, for peace in #Iraq! God always listens. It is up to us to walk His paths. My dear Christian brothers and sisters from #Iraq, who have testified to your faith in Jesus amid harsh sufferings: I cannot wait to see you. I am honoured to encounter a Church of martyrs: thank you for your witness! https://t.co/bgm76p31tM Tomorrow I will go to #Iraq for a three-day pilgrimage. I have long wanted to meet those people who have suffered so much. I ask you to accompany this apostolic journey with your prayers, so it may unfold in the best possible way and bear hoped-for fruits. #Lent is a time to believe, or rather to receive God into our life so that we may \u201cmake our home with Him\u201d (Jn 14: 23) Sad news of bloody clashes and loss of life reach us from Myanmar. I appeal to the authorities involved that dialogue may prevail over repression, and ask the international community to ensure that the aspirations of the people of Myanmar are not stifled. We would not have had the courage to believe in a God who loves humanity, if we had not known Jesus. What kind of God is prepared to die for people? What kind of God loves always and patiently, without demanding to be loved in return? #GeneralAudience Let us #PrayTogether that we may experience the sacrament of reconciliation with renewed depth, to taste the forgiveness and infinite mercy of God. #PrayerIntentions https://t.co/f6wrayko76 The center of confession is Jesus who waits for us, who listens to us and forgives us. All of us are specialists in crucifying others to save ourselves. Jesus, instead, allowed himself to be crucified, to teach us not to shift evil onto others. #Lent I ask government leaders, businesses, international organizations to cooperate and to seek a solution for everyone regarding #Covid: vaccines for everyone, especially for the world's most vulnerable and needy people. #ZeroDiscriminationDay In the case of rare diseases, a support network among family members is more important than ever. I encourage those initiatives that support research and cures and I express my closeness to those who ill, especially the children, and their families. I join my voice to that of the Bishops of Nigeria to condemn the vile kidnapping of the 317 girls, taken away from their school in Jangebe. I am praying for these girls so they might return home soon. I am near to their families. The #GospelOfTheDay (Mk 9:2-10) calls us to contemplate Jesus's transfiguration. It is an invitation to remember, especially when we pass through a difficult trial, that the Lord is Risen and does not permit darkness to have the last word. A year ago today the #RomeCall for Artificial Intelligence was signed and I hope that more and more people of goodwill will cooperate to promote the common good, protect the lasts and develop a shared algorethics. Through recollection and silent prayer, hope is given to us as interior light, illuminating the challenges and choices we face in our mission. Hence the need to pray and, in secret, to encounter the Father of tender love (Mt 6:6). #Lent During the Season of #Lent, the Holy Spirit drives us too, like Jesus, into the desert (Mk 1:12-15). It is not a physical place, but rather an existential dimension in which we can be silent and listen to the word of God, so that a true conversion might be effected in us. May the example of so many doctors and healthcare workers who have risked their life to the point of losing it due to the #pandemic move us to feeling truly grateful for how generously, and sometimes heroically, they carry out their profession. In this #LentenSeason, accepting and living the truth revealed in Christ means, first of all, opening our hearts to God\u2019s word, which the Church passes on from generation to generation. Lord, Our God, grant that we Christians may live the Gospel, and recognize Christ in each human being, so as to see him crucified in the sufferings of the abandoned and forgotten of our world, and risen in each brother or sister who makes a new start. #WorldDayOfSocialJustice Fasting, prayer and almsgiving, as preached by Jesus (cf. Mt 6:1-18), enable and express our conversion. #Lent #Lent is precisely the season of hope when we turn our gaze back to the God who is patient. Saint Paul passionately urges us to place our hope in reconciliation: \u201cBe reconciled to God\u201d (2 Cor 5:20). Let us return to the Holy Spirit, the Giver of Life, to the Fire that resurrects our #ashes. Let us pray once more to the Spirit and rediscover the fire of praise, which consumes the ashes of lamentation and resignation. #Lent Today we bow our heads to receive #ashes. #Lent is a humble descent both inwards and towards others. It is about realizing that salvation is not an ascent to glory, but a descent in love. It is about becoming little. https://t.co/1Jfc1j0vcR We are now embarking on our #LentenJourney, which opens with the words of the prophet Joel. They point out the path we are to follow. We hear an invitation that arises from God: \u201cReturn to me with all your heart\u201d (Joel 2:12). Lent is a journey of return to God. During this season of #conversion, let us renew our faith, draw from the \u201cliving water\u201d of hope, and receive with open hearts the love of God, who makes us brothers and sisters in Christ. #Lent\nhttps://t.co/LA8HkEjcRv This haste, this everything right now, does not come from God. If we get worked up about the right now, we forget what remains forever: we follow the passing clouds and lose sight of the sky. Let us pray together today in memory of twenty-one Coptic Martyrs: may they intercede for us all before the Father. https://t.co/pa395BHSU1 To understand God's plan for our lives better, let us seek to strengthen our relationship with Him through #Prayer. Thus we will discover that God is a compassionate Father who always takes care of us. May the Lord inspire everyone to draw near to those who suffer, especially children, and to put the weakest in first place. I entrust the doctors and all sick children to the Virgin Mary so that with her mother affection she might look after them. #ICCDay We are created to love and through the conjugal union of a man and a woman, this vocation is lived reciprocally and in complete and definitive communion of life. On this memorial of St Valentine, I accompany engaged and married couples with my prayer. May the intercession of Saints Cyril and Methodius, evangelizers of the Slavic people, help us find new ways to communicate the Gospel and that the Christian churches grow in their desire to walk toward full unity while respecting differences. Each of us might experience wounds, failure, suffering, selfishness that make us close ourselves off from God and others. In the face of all this, Jesus draws near with compassion and touches our life to heal it. #GospelOfTheDay #Radio has this beautiful trait: it carries the word to the most distant places #WorldRadioDay Those who put arms into the hands of children instead of food, books and toys commit a crime not only against the little ones, but against all of humanity. #ChildrenNotSoldiers On the #WorldDayOfTheSick special attention goes toward those who are ill and to those who assist them. I think especially of those who suffer the consequences of the #coronavirus pandemic. I express my nearness to everyone, especially to the poorest. Through the intercession of #OurLadyOfLourdes, patroness of the sick, let us ask the Lord to grant health of soul and body to all those who suffer due to illness and the current pandemic. May He give strength to those who assist them in this time of trial. I express my closeness to the victims of the calamity that happened in #India where part of a glacier separated itself provoking violent flooding that devastated two power plants. I pray for the workers who died, for their families and for all those who were wounded. The person who prays is like someone in love with the beloved in his or her heart wherever they go. So we can pray at any moment, and during what happens every day: on the street, in the office, on public transportation, through words and in the silence of our hearts. #Prayer All of us are responsible for the communications we make, for the information we share, for the control that we can exert over fake news by exposing it. All of us are to be witnesses of the truth. #SaferInternetDay #Fraternity is the true cure for the pandemic and the many evils that have affected us. Along with vaccines, fraternity and hope are, as it were, the medicine we need in today\u2019s world.\nhttps://t.co/ZFXaCQivv5 The International Day of Prayer and Awareness against Human Trafficking encourages us to not stop praying and fighting together so that every person who is enslaved might be restored to freedom. #PrayAgainstTrafficking https://t.co/QQIMmNEbrF The wounds of our brothers and sisters exploited by human trafficking cry out to us. They are victims of an economic system that, by maximizing profit, causes \"the human person to be commotidized\". Let us all be committed to a just and solidary economy. #PrayAgainstTrafficking Let us ask for the grace that our eyes might see the drama of our brothers and sisters who are the victims of trafficking in persons, and for the courage to act so that our communities will be free of slavery. #PrayAgainstTrafficking I would like to make an appeal in favor of unaccompanied minors, those who find themselves on the so called \"Balkan route\" and those on all the other \"routes\". May they not lack the care they deserve or the and preferential humanitarian channels because of us. Once again I would like to assure my spiritual closely and solidarity to the people of Myanmar. And I am praying so that all those with leadership responsibilities in the country might make themselves sincerely available to serve the common good. Let us to allow Jesus to heal us \u2013 we always need this, everyone \u2013 so that we might in our turn be witnesses to God\u2019s healing tenderness. #GospelOfTheDay In the spirit of human fraternity, I invite everyone not to forget the most vulnerable populations, and to give particular attention to neglected tropical diseases that affect the poorest people. Let us promote the necessary treatments so that no one will be left behind. Social friendship and universal fraternity necessarily call for an acknowledgement of the worth of every human person, always and everywhere. #FratelliTutti There is no time today for indifference. Either we are brothers and sisters, or everything will fall apart. Fraternity is the new frontier for humanity on which we need to build; it is the challenge of our century.  @alimamaltayeb #HumanFraternity https://t.co/oWCr5gzxSg I would like to congratulate the UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, and Latifah Ibn Ziaten, Foundress of the Imad Association for Youth and Peace, winners of the 2021 #ZayedAward for #HumanFraternity. I thank both of you for your witness. Tomorrow we will celebrate the first #HumanFraternityDay. Let us pray and work each and every day so that everyone might live fraternally together in our world and in peace. The Church evangelizes and is herself evangelized through the beauty of the Liturgy.Let us ask the grace of a personal and authentic encounter with the living Christ in the liturgical celebration,so that our lives might become a spiritual sacrifice offered to God.#GeneralAudience The Lord does not call us to be soloists, but to be part of a choir that can sometimes miss a note or two, but must always try to sing in unison. #ConsecratedLife Let us contemplate God\u2019s patience and implore the trusting patience of Simeon (Lk 2:25). In this way, may our eyes, too, see the light of salvation and bring that light to the whole world. https://t.co/QNDcxqqvH2 Grandparents are the uniting link between generations to transmit to the young the experience of life and faith. Therefore, I have decided to institute the World Day of Grandparents and the Elderly which will be held annually on the fourth Sunday of July. The pandemic has confirmed how necessary it is to protect the right to health for the weakest: I hope that the leaders of the nations may unite forces to cure those who are ill with Hansen's disease and for their inclusion in society. When we read the Gospel by ourselves with an open heart, a little of its light and beneficial power always reaches us, enlightening, healing, consoling. #GospelOfTheDay Mk 1:21-28 The Lord looks for us where we are, he loves us as we are, and he patiently walks by our side. With his word, he wants to change us, to invite us to live fuller lives and to put out into the deep together with him. The culture of life is the heritage that Christians want to share with everyone. Every human life, unique and unrepeatable, is priceless. This must be courageously proclaimed ever anew through word and action. The history of evangelization began with the Lord\u2019s own passionate desire to call and enter into friendly dialogue with everyone, just as they are (Jn 15:12-17). https://t.co/oHNkqpUrmX The words of the Sacred Scripture were not written to remain imprisoned on papyrus, parchment or paper, but to be received by a person who prays, making them blossom in his or her heart. #Prayer #WordOfGod Today we celebrate #RemembranceDay. To remember is an expression of humanity; it means being attentive because these things can happen again, starting with ideological proposals that are intended to save a people and end up destroying humanity. The word of God is the antidote to our fear of having to face life. In speaking to us, the Lord reminds us that we are in his heart, that we are precious in his eyes, and that he holds us in the palm of his hand. We are branches of the same vine, we are communicating vessels: the good and the bad each one does is poured out on the others. To the extent that we remain in God we draw closer to others, and to the extent that we draw closer to others we remain in God. #ChristianUnity I wish to thank all those who, during this Week, have prayed and will continue to pray for #ChristianUnity. Let us not ignore God\u2019s word! It is a love letter, written to us by the One who knows us best. In reading it, we again hear his voice, see his face and receive his Spirit. #SundayOfTheWord May the Word of God sown in the soil of our hearts, lead us in turn to sow hope through closeness to others. Just as God has done with us. #SundayOfTheWord Prior to every word of ours about God, there is his word to us, his Word who continues to tell us: \u201cDo not be afraid, I am with you. I am at your side and I will always be there\u201d. #SundayOfTheWord https://t.co/LI6Xim8rLg Jesus speaks of God to everyone, wherever they find themselves: he speaks \u201cwalking along the shore\u201d,to fishermen who were \u201ccasting their nets\u201d (Mk 1:16).He speaks to people in the most ordinary times and places. Here we see the universal power of the Word of God. #SundayOfTheWord The #WordOfGod consoles and encourages us. At the same time it summons us to conversion, challenges us, frees us from the bondage of our selfishness. For His word has the power to change our lives and to lead us out of darkness into the light. The #WordofGod took on a face. The invisible God let Himself be seen, heard and touched (see 1 Jn 1:1-3). The word is effective only if it is \u201cseen\u201d, if it engages us in experience, in dialogue. Thus, the invitation to \u201ccome and see\u201d was, and continues to be, essential. I would like to devote this Message for World Communications Day this year to the invitation to \u201ccome and see\u201d (Jn 1:46). In order to tell the truth we need to go and see, listen to people and confront reality. #WCD https://t.co/DYM8iEYm0p During this time of serious hardship, this #Prayer is even more necessary so that unity might prevail over conflicts. Our good example is fundamental: it is essential that Christians pursue the path toward full visible unity. #ChristianUnity I strongly encourage all States and all people to work decisively toward promoting conditions necessary for a world without nuclear weapons, contributing to the advancement of #peace and multilateral cooperation which humanity greatly needs today. Each one of us Christians is a branch of the one vine which is Jesus; and all of us together are called to bear the fruits of this common membership in Christ. #Prayer #ChristianUnity #ChristianUnity can be achieved only as a fruit of #prayer. Jesus opened the way for us by praying.  Our prayer for unity is thus a participation in the Lord\u2019s prayer, who promised that any prayer said in His name would be heard by the Father. The world\u2019s faith depends on #ChristianUnity; in fact, the Lord asked that we be one \u201cso the world might believe\u201d (Jn 17:21). The world will not believe because of our convincing arguments, but because we have borne witness to that love that unites us and draws us near. #Prayer After the Last Supper, Jesus prayed for His own, \u201cthat they may all be one\u201d (Jn 17:21). This means that we are not able to achieve unity with our own strength. Above all, unity is a gift, it is a grace to be requested through #prayer. #ChristianUnity Jesus invites us to abide in Him so as to bear much fruit (see Jn 15:5-9). Abiding in the Lord means finding the courage to step outside of ourselves to take care of others' needs and give a Christian witness in the world. #Prayer #UnityOfChristians Today The Week of Prayer for Christian Unity begins. This year, the theme refers to Jesus\u2019s counsel: \u201cAbide in my love and you shall bear much fruit\u201d (cf. Jn 15:5-9). #PrayTogether Let us pray together for our brothers and sisters of Sulawesi, in Indonesia, hit by a strong earthquake. May the Lord console and sustain the efforts of all those who are engaged in bringing aid. Let us also pray for the victims of the airplane accident in Indonesia. The design that God has for each one of us is always a design of love. And the greatest joy for every\nbeliever is to respond to that call, offering one\u2019s entire being to the service of God and the brothers and sisters. #Angelus We are always on a journey in life. Let us choose the path of God! We will discover that there are no unexpected events, no uphill path, and no night that cannot be faced with Jesus. In each act of service, in every work of #mercy we perform, God manifests Himself; God sets His gaze upon the world. God overcomes the world's evil by taking it upon himself. This is also how we can lift others up: not by judging, not by suggesting what to do, but by becoming neighbours, empathizing, sharing God's love. In difficult and dark moments let us find the courage to say: \"Blessed are you, Lord\". Let us praise the Lord: this will be so good for us. #Prayer #GeneralAudience We possess a great wealth that depends on what we are: the life we have received, the good within us, the indelible beauty God has given us by making us in his image. All these things make each of us precious in his eyes, each one of us is priceless and unique in history. A society is all the more human to the degree that it cares effectively for its most frail and suffering members, in a spirit of fraternal love. https://t.co/QerQ2QbOiz It is striking that the Lord spent most of his time on Earth living an ordinary life, without standing out. It is a beautiful message that reveals the greatness of daily life, the importance in God's eyes of every gesture and moment of life, even the most simple. I am praying for the United States of America, shaken by the recent attack on Congress. I pray for those who lost their life. Violence is always self-destructive. I urge everyone to promote a culture of encounter and of care to construct the common good. Today I could not celebrate Baptisms in the Sistine Chapel, as is customary. I am praying for all the children who at this time are receiving Baptism, the Christian identity, the grace of forgiveness and of redemption. The Father says to each one of us, as He did to Jesus: \u201cYou are my beloved Son\u201d. We are God's beloved children. This is our deepest identity. It is the first point of the spiritual life and we are reminded about it by Jesus first public gesture. #BaptismoftheLord This is the great meaning of #Christmas: God becomes man so that we can become children of God. Christmas is passing. But we must return to family life, to work, transformed, we must return glorifying and praising God for all that we have heard and seen. We must bring the good news to the world: Jesus is our saviour. May the Child of Bethlehem help us, then, to be generous, supportive and helpful, especially towards those who are vulnerable, the sick, those unemployed or experiencing hardship. I extend my affection to the brothers and sisters of the Oriental Churches, Catholic and Orthodox, who celebrate the Nativity of the Lord today. To them, I wish them a Holy Christmas in the light of Christ our peace and our hope! Today we celebrate World Missionary Child Day. I thank all the children and boys and girls who are involved. I encourage you to be joyful witnesses of Jesus, seeking to always bring fraternity among your peers. Like the Magi, we too are called to allow ourselves to be attracted, illuminated and converted by Christ: He is the journey of faith, through prayer and the contemplation of God\u2019s works, which continually fill us with every new joy and wonder. The first step towards an attitude of worship is to \u201clift up our eyes\u201d. When we lift up our eyes to God, life\u2019s problems do not go away, but we feel certain that the Lord grants us the strength to deal with them. https://t.co/VurdvapT7J To worship the Lord, we first have to \u201clift up our eyes\u201d: not to let ourselves be imprisoned by those imaginary spectres that stifle hope, knowing that the Lord is aware of our troubles, attentive to our prayers and not indifferent to the tears we shed. https://t.co/x9CKZMSKV3 In the Child Jesus, God shows Himself to be lovable, full of goodness and gentleness. We can truly love a God like that with all our hearts. As he did in Bethlehem, so too with us, God loves to work wonders through our poverty.  He placed the whole of our salvation in the manger of a stable. He is unafraid of our poverty, so let us allow his mercy to transform it completely! Jesus is the eternal Word of God, who has always thought of us and wanted to communicate with us. #Angelus Looking at the Nativity scene, we can become a little childlike and allow the wonder of the \u201cmarvellous\u201d way in which God wanted to come into the world to be reborn in us. This will revive tenderness in us; and today we are in great need of tenderness! #WorldPeaceDay https://t.co/2gzUCaXQZO #Peace can become a reality if we begin to be in peace with ourselves and with those who are near us, removing the obstacles that prevent us from taking care of those who find themselves in need and in indigence. #WorldPeaceDay https://t.co/oIFRche7sz Holy Mother of God, to you we consecrate this New Year. You, who know how to cherish things in your heart, care for us, bless our time, and teach us to find time for God and for others. https://t.co/Luja5nQcEO https://t.co/qpIKKklZLB The blessing and praise that the Lord loves the most is love of neighbour. We praise him for this, because we believe and we know that all the good that is accomplished day after day on earth, in the end, comes from him. We thank God for for the good things that have taken place during the pandemic, for the many people who, without making noise, have tried to make the weight of this trial more bearable. #Christmas is the feast of Love incarnate, born for us in Jesus Christ. He is the light of humanity shining in the darkness, giving meaning to human existence and all of history. The Son of God comes down from heaven and comes to earth to bring us to heaven! This is what we need to meditate on, contemplate, what we need to reflect on during #Christmas. The #prayer of thanksgiving begins by recognizing that we were thought of before we learned how to think; we were loved before we learned how to love.  If we view life like this, then \u201cthank you\u201d becomes the driving force of our day. #GeneralAudience Yesterday, an earthquake in Croatia caused victims and caused serious damage. I express my closeness to the wounded and to those who have been affected by the quake and I pray in particular for those who have lost their lives and for their families. The Son of God was born an outcast, in order to tell us that every outcast is a child of God.  He came into the world as each child comes into the world, weak and vulnerable, so that we can learn to accept our weaknesses with tender love. While humanity\u2019s ruin is that everyone goes their own way, in the nativity scene everyone converges upon Jesus, Prince of Peace in the night of the world. #Nativityscene I have decided to declare a special year dedicated to the Family #Amorislaetitia, which will be inaugurated on the next Solemnity of Saint Joseph. Let us entrust this journey with families all over the world to the Holy Family of Nazareth. We too can change evil into good each day.  Loving actions change history: even the ones that are small, hidden, everyday. For God guides history through the humble courage of those who pray, love and forgive. Saint Stephan  is the first martyr, the first of a host of brothers and sisters who continue to bring the light into the darkness \u2013 while he was on the receiving end of the stones of hatred, reciprocated with words of forgiveness. He thus changed history. In the past few days I have received Christmas greetings from Rome and other parts of the world. Since it is impossible to respond to everyone, I express my gratitude to everyone, especially for the gift of prayer, which I willingly reciprocate. May Christmas be an opportunity for all of us to rediscover the family as a cradle of life and faith, a place of acceptance and love, dialogue, forgiveness, fraternal solidarity and shared joy, a source of peace for all humanity. By his birth in the flesh, the Son of God consecrated familial love.  My thoughts at this moment turn to families: to those who cannot come together today and to those forced to remain at home. Every other person is my brother or my sister.  In everyone, I see reflected the face of God, and in those who suffer, I see the Lord pleading for my help.  I see him in the sick, the poor, the unemployed, the marginalized, the migrant and the refugee. Thanks to this Child, all of us can speak to God and call him \u201cFather\u201d. We can all call one another brothers and sisters.  We come from every continent, from every language and culture, with our own identities and differences, yet we are all brothers and sisters. \u201cTo us a child is born\u201d (Is 9:6).  He came to save us!  He tells us that pain and evil are not the final word.  To become resigned to violence and injustice would be to reject the joy and hope of Christmas. The birth of Jesus is the \u201cnewness\u201d that enables us to be reborn each year and to find, in him, the strength needed to face every trial. #Christmas #Christmas https://t.co/uaOdqUJSaQ To us a son is given. Jesus, you are the Child who makes me a child. You, my Saviour, teach me to serve. You who did not leave me alone, help me to comfort your brothers and sisters, for, from this night forward, all are my brothers and sisters. #Christmas God came into the world as a child to make us children of God.  What a magnificent gift!  This day, God amazes us and says to each of us: \u201cYou are amazing\u201d. #Christmas God came among us in poverty and need, to tell us that in serving the poor, we will show our love for him.  From this night onward, as a poet wrote, \u201cGod\u2019s residence is next to mine, his furniture is love\u201d (Emily Dickinson, Poems, XVII). #Christmas Follow the Solemnity of the Nativity of the Lord - Midnight Mass - Saint Peter's Basilica at 19:30 (CET)  https://t.co/Ek22HaeB8U https://t.co/vv2Bcpn1jB Christmas is the feast of God's love for us: the divine love that inspires, directs and corrects change, and defeats the human fear of leaving \"safety\" to cast us back onto the \"mystery\". If the #pandemic has forced us to be more distant, Jesus, in the crib, shows us the way of tenderness to be close to each other, to be human. Let us follow this path. #Christmas #GeneralAudience May the joyous expectation of the coming of the Saviour who became man, like us, fill our hearts with hope and peace. #Advent Those who fail to view a crisis in the light of the Gospel simply perform an autopsy on a cadaver. They see the crisis, but not the hope and the light brought by the Gospel. https://t.co/L2y9Memill Jesus does not wait until we are good to love us, but gives Himself freely to us. Instead of complaining in these difficult times about what the pandemic prevents us from doing, let us do something for someone who has less: not the umpteenth gift for ourselves and our friends, but for a person in need whom no-one thinks of! #Angelus #Solidarity finds concrete expression in service, which can take a variety of forms in an effort to care for others. And service means caring for the vulnerable members of our families, our society, our people. #HumanSolidarityDay The Christmas tree and the Nativity scene are signs of hope, especially in this difficult time. Let us be sure we do not stop at the sign, but get to the meaning, that is, to Jesus, to the love of God that He revealed to us, the infinite goodness that he made shine on the world. I encourage you to dedicate time to prayer, meditating in the light of the Word of God, so that the Holy Spirit who inhabits it might illuminate the path to follow and transform our hearts, as we await the birth of Our Lord Jesus. #Advent Loving our neighbour as ourselves means being committed to building a world in which everyone has access to the goods of the earth, in which all can develop as individuals and as families, and in which fundamental rights and dignity are guaranteed to all. #MigrantsDay \u201cOur soul waits for the Lord: he is our help and shield. Yes, our heart is glad in him\u201d (Ps 33:20-21). The confident expectation of the Lord allows us to find comfort and courage in the dark moments of our lives. #Advent The events of this year teach us the importance of caring for each other and creation. Therefore I have chosen, as the theme for the Message for the 54th #WorldPeaceDay, \"The culture of care as a journey of peace\". https://t.co/oIFRche7sz I ask God to inspire, in the hearts of all, respect for the life of our brothers, especially the most fragile and helpless, and to give strength to those who receive them and care for them, even when this demands heroic love. #Prayer during the time of #Advent helps us to remember we are not more righteous or better than others, but that we are all sinners who need to be touched by God's mercy. #GeneralAudience To pray is to light a candle in the darkness. #Prayer rouses us from the tepidness of a purely horizontal existence, lifts our gaze to higher things, makes us attuned to the Lord, allows God to be close to us; it frees us from our solitude and gives us hope. #Advent is the time we are given to welcome the Lord who comes to encounter us, and also to verify our longing for God, to look forward and prepare ourselves for Christ\u2019s return. I bless the statuettes of Jesus, which will be placed in the Nativity scene. When you pray at home, before the Nativity scene with your families, allow yourselves to be drawn by the tenderness of Baby Jesus, born poor and frail among us, in order to give us his love. The Virgin Mary silently awaited God's Word of salvation; she welcomed it; she listened to it; she conceived it. In her, God became close. This is why the Church calls Mary a \u201cCause of our joy\u201d. #Angelus The current pandemic and climate change affect above all the lives of the poor. We must promote a culture that places at its center human dignity and the common good. For this reason the Holy See joins in the objective of net zero emission. https://t.co/k2cRGfqtrC Looking at the image of Our Lady of #Guadalupe, we see these three realities reflected: abundance, blessing and gift. God always gives Himself in abundance in His blessings. Accompanied by the Mother of Jesus on the journey towards Christmas, in these times that are difficult for many, let us make an effort to rediscover the great hope and joy brought to us by the coming of the Son of God into the world. #Advent Everyone is called to contribute with courage and determination to the respect for the fundamental rights of every person, especially the \"invisible\": of the many who are hungry and thirsty, who are naked, sick, outcast or imprisoned. God listens to the cry of those who invoke Him. Even our reluctant questions, those that remain in the depths of our heart. The Father wishes to give us the Holy Spirit, which inspires every #prayer and transforms everything. It is a question of patience, of supporting the wait. 150 years after the proclamation of St Joseph as Patron of the Catholic Church, I would like to share some personal reflections on this extraordinary figure, so close to our own human experience.\nhttps://t.co/GOQ2CVmOm4 The uncontaminated beauty of our Mother is incomparable, but at the same time it attracts us. Let us entrust ourselves to her and say \u201cno\u201d to sin and \u201cyes\u201d to Grace once and for all. #Angelus I want to be close to all doctors and nurses during this time in which the pandemic calls us to be near all men and women who suffer. Thank you for drawing near to them, thanks for your tenderness, thanks for your professionalism in taking care of the sick. Conversion is a grace that we need to forcefully ask God for. We are converted to the degree in which we open ourselves up to the beauty, the goodness, the tenderness of God. Thus let us leave what is false and fleeting for what is true, beautiful and everlasting. #GospelOfTheDay Just as before our birth, our loved ones awaited us, so now Love in person awaits us. If we are awaited in Heaven, why should we be caught up with earthly concerns?  Why should we waste time complaining about the night, when the light of day awaits us? Come, Lord Jesus, make our distracted hearts watchful. Awaken within us the desire to pray and the need to love. To help our society to \u201cbuild back better\u201d, inclusion of the vulnerable must also entail efforts to promote their active participation. #IDPD https://t.co/JIIJgNx76E Inclusion should be the \u201crock\u201d on which to build programmes and initiatives of civil institutions meant to ensure that no one, especially those in greatest difficulty, is left behind. #IDPD The first step of faith is to tell God that we need him, that we need him to be close to us. Thus, if we ask Jesus to come close to us, we will train ourselves to be watchful. I want to assure my prayers for #Nigeria. Last Saturday more than one hundred farmers were brutally killed. May God welcome them in His peace and comfort their families, and convert the hearts of those who commit similar atrocities which gravely offend His name. God\u2019s grace changes lives: He takes us as we are, but He never leaves us as we are. #GeneralAudience Today, as in the past, slavery is rooted in a notion of the human person that allows people to be treated like an object, it tramples their dignity. Slavery makes us \"un-dignified\" because it takes way everyone's dignity. https://t.co/L5HYLITf43 Let us frequently repeat the traditional #Advent prayer: \u201cCome, Lord Jesus\u201d (Rev 22:20): before meetings, studying, work, and before making decisions, in the important moments or times of trial: Come, Lord Jesus! Let us keep in mind that not even a murderer loses his personal dignity \u2014 God Himself guarantees it (see EV 9). The firm rejection of the death penalty shows to what extent it is possible to recognize the inalienable dignity of every human being. #FratelliTutti #NoDeathPenalty #Advent is the Season in which we remember God's nearness, that He came down toward us. Praying and loving, that is what it means to be watchful. When the Church worships God and serves our neighbour, it does not live in the night.However weak and weary, she journeys towards the Lord. Let us now call out to him. Come, Lord Jesus, we need you! https://t.co/nZPQIdeu1T #Advent is a continuous call to hope: it reminds us that God is present in history to lead it to its ultimate goal and to its fullness, which is the Lord Jesus Christ. Conversion is precisely this: instead of being on the wrong road, we go on God's road. https://t.co/w5f5Kbxn9P All of us love Jesus, all of us want to follow him, yet we must always be careful to remain on the road. For with our feet, with our bodies, we can be with Him, but our hearts can wander far afield and so lead us off the road. #Consistory The proclamation of the passion, death and resurrection (Mk 10:32-45) is a saving Word necessary for the Church in every age. We too, Pope and Cardinals, must always see ourselves reflected in this Word, it is painful, but it also heals, liberates and converts us. #Consistory Follow the Ordinary Public Consistory for the creation of new Cardinals - Saint Peter's Basilica at 16 (CET)  https://t.co/FTKcnquY2k https://t.co/z0EZEGDCyd We do not live aimlessly and without destination. We are awaited. We are precious. God has prepared for us the most worthy and beautiful place: Paradise. I invite everyone to pray for #Ethiopia where armed clashes have intensified and are causing a serious humanitarian situation. I appeal to the parties in conflict so that the violence might ceases, life may be safeguarded and the populations can regain #peace. God is more patient than we are, and those who knock with faith and perseverance on the door of his heart will not be disappointed. #Prayer Lord, Father of our human family, you created all human beings equal in dignity: pour forth into our hearts a fraternal spirit. Move us to create healthier societies and a more dignified world, a world without hunger, poverty, violence and war. #FratelliTutti When we pray, God opens our eyes renews and changes our hearts, heals our wounds and grants us the grace we need. #GeneralAudience #Prayer Too often, women are insulted, beaten, raped, forced to prostitute themselves.... If we want a better world, that will be a peaceful home and not a battlefield, we all need to do a lot more for the dignity of each woman. Let us care for the needs of every man and woman, young and old, with the same fraternal spirit of care and closeness that marked the Good Samaritan. #FratelliTutti We were not created to dream about vacations or the weekend, but to make God\u2019s dreams come true in this world. God made us capable of dreaming, so that we could embrace the beauty of life. The works of mercy are the most beautiful works in life. Dear young people, let us not give up on great dreams. The Lord does not want us to narrow our horizons or to remain parked on the roadside of life.  He wants us to race boldly and joyfully towards lofty goals. #takeupthecross https://t.co/RG9dMvwXEt Before pouring out His love for us on the cross, Jesus shares His final wishes. He tells us that the good we do to one of our least brothers and sisters \u2013 hungry, thirsty, strangers, in need, sick, imprisoned \u2013 we do to Him (Mt 25:37-40). #GospelOfTheDay Today, #ChristTheKing Sunday, the Cross and the icon of Mary, Salus Populi Romani, symbols of World Youth Days, begins a new pilgrimage which will lead to Lisbon in 2023. #takeupthecross Dear young people, the effects of our actions and decisions affect you personally. Therefore, you can\u2019t remain outside the places that are shaping the present and future. You\u2019re either part of them or history will pass you by. #FrancescoEconomy https://t.co/SozNfxjdu8 Today we remember Mary\u2019s Presentation in the Temple and celebrate #ProOrantibus Day. Thank you, contemplative sisters and brothers, because you are support for the weak, beacons that signal the port, torches that illuminate the dark night, sentinels who announce the new day. A pleasure to speak by phone yesterday with my brother @alimamaltayeb, Grand Imam of Al-Azhar. We reaffirm our support to human fraternity as the solution to erase violence, discrimination and hatred in the name of religion. Religions have nothing to do with these. #FratelliTutti Every child needs to be welcomed and defended, helped and protected, from the moment of their conception. #WorldChildrensDay The earth and its poor urgently demand a sound economy and a sustainable development. Therefore, we are called to rethink our mental and moral priorities so that they are in conformity with God\u2019s commandments and the common good. \u201cMary kept all these things, reflecting on them in her heart\u201d (Lk 2:19). Everything that happens to her ends up in her heart so that it might pass through the sieve of #prayer and be transfigured by it. #GeneralAudience Even a smile that we can share with the poor is a source of love. An outstretched hand can always be enriched by the smile of those who quietly and unassumingly offer to help, inspired only by the joy of living as one of Christ\u2019s disciples. Every form of fundamentalist intolerance damages relationships between individuals, groups and peoples. Let us be committed to living and teaching the value of respect, a love capable of welcoming differences, and the priority of the dignity of every human being. #TolleranceDay I am near in prayer to the dear people of the #Philippines  who are suffering because of the destruction, and especially because of the flooding caused by a strong #typhoon. I express my solidarity to the poorest families and those who are doing all they can to help them. Hold out your hand to the poor, instead of demanding what you lack.  In this way, you will multiply the talents you have received. (Mt 25:14-30) #WorldDayOfThePoor #GospelOfTheDay https://t.co/wQ7D6r26zN The Lord\u2019s blessing descends upon us and prayer attains its goal when accompanied by service to the poor.  #WorldDayOfThePoor https://t.co/52RPz4TfJr The ability to stretch forth our hand shows that we possess an innate capacity to act in ways that give meaning to life. #WorldDayOfThePoor Generosity that supports the weak, consoles the afflicted, relieves suffering and restores dignity to those stripped of it, is a condition for a fully human life. #WorldDayOfThePoor The one who prays is never alone. In fact, Jesus welcomes us in His prayer so that we might pray in Him and through Him. This is the work of the Holy Spirit. The Gospel invites us to pray to the Father in Jesus\u2019s name. #Prayer #GeneralAudience Yesterday, the Report on the sad case of former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick was published. I renew my closeness to the victims of sexual abuse and the Church's commitment to eradicate this evil.  https://t.co/OMVcbFcyhC Today we celebrate the liturgical memorial of #SaintMartin, Bishop of Tours, a great Pastor in the Church who distinguished himself with evangelical charity toward the poor and marginalized. May his example teach us to be ever more courageous in the faith and generous in charity. Society is enriched by the dialogue between science and faith, which opens up new horizons for thought. The light of faith needs to enlighten scientific advances so that they respect the centrality of the human person.  #WorldScienceDay Today, on the Feast of the Dedication of the Basilica of St John Lateran, we recall that the Lord desires to dwell in every heart. Even if we should distance ourselves from Him, the Lord needs only three days to reconstruct His temple within us\" (See Jn 2:19) Let us pray for the populations of Central America who were hit by a violent hurricane. May the Lord welcome the deceased, comfort their families and sustain those most in need, as well as all those who are doing all they can to help them. I am following with concern the news arriving from Ethiopia. While I urge that the temptation of an armed conflict be rejected, I invite everyone to prayer and to fraternal respect, to dialogue and to a peaceful end to the disagreements. \"Faith working through love\" (Gal 5:6) is the shining lamp with which we can pass through the night beyond death and reach the great feast of life. #GospelOfTheDay (Mt 25:1-13) All of us are able to give without expecting anything in return, to do good to others without demanding that they treat us well in return. As Jesus told his disciples: \u201cWithout cost you have received, without cost you are to give\u201d (Mt 10:8). #FratelliTutti War is the negation of all rights and a dramatic assault on the environment. If we want true integral human development for all, we must work tirelessly to avoid war. #EnvironmentConflictDay #FratelliTutti https://t.co/VqVZmzQ5go Prayer for the deceased, raised in the trust that they dwell with God, extends its benefits to us too: it educates us in a true vision of life; it opens us up to true freedom, disposing us to the continuous search for eternal goods. https://t.co/AzNl3aZyp1 Let us attend the school of Jesus Christ, teacher of #Prayer. May we learn from Him that prayer is primarily listening and encountering God, an art to be practiced with insistence, the place where we perceive that everything comes from God and returns to Him. #GeneralAudience I express my sorrow and dismay for the terrorist attack in #Vienna, and I pray for the victims and their families. Enough violence! Let us together strengthen peace and fraternity. Only love can silence hate. Today we pray for all the #FaithfulDeparted and especially for the victims of the #Coronavirus: for those who have died alone, without the caress of their loved ones; and for those who have given their lives serving the sick. Choosing purity, meekness and mercy; choosing to entrust oneself to the Lord in poverty of spirit and in affliction; dedicating oneself to justice and peace \u2013 this means going against the current. This evangelical path was trodden by #AllTheSaints and Blesseds. #GospelOfTheDay Every saint is a message which the Holy Spirit takes from the riches of Jesus Christ and gives to his people. #GaudeteEtExsultate #AllSaintsDay https://t.co/7kG5vq0Lcn We need to look at our cities with a contemplative gaze, a gaze of faith which sees God dwelling in homes, on the streets and squares. This presence must be found, discovered. God does not hide himself from those who seek him with a sincere heart. #WorldCitiesDay Jesus challenges us to put aside all differences and, in the face of suffering, to draw near to others with no questions asked. #FratelliTutti I am close to the Catholic community of #Nice, mourning the attack that sowed death in a place of prayer and consolation. I pray for the victims, for their families and for the beloved French people, that they may respond to evil with good. I unite myself to the pain of the families of the students barbarically killed in #Kumba, #Cameroon. May God enlighten hearts, so that similar acts may never be repeated! I send my affection to the families and all Cameroon, and I invoke the comfort that only God can give. \u201cYou are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased\u201d (Lk 3:22). This simple phrase enables us to intuit something of the mystery of Jesus and of His heart, always turned to the Father. Jesus gave us His own #Prayer, which is His loving dialogue with the Father. #GeneralAudience Those who love may be sure that none of their acts of love will be lost, nor any of their acts of sincere concern for others, nor any single act of love for God, nor any generous effort, nor any painful endurance. All of these enfold our world like a vital force. #FratelliTutti Kindness frees us from the cruelty that at times infects human relationships, from the anxiety that prevents us from thinking of others, from the frantic flurry of activity that forgets that others also have a right to be happy. #FratelliTutti Let us pray to the Lord for Nigeria, so that every form of violence might always be avoided, in the constant search of social harmony through the promotion of justice and the common good. What is not expressed in love of neighbour is not true love of God; and, likewise, what is not drawn from one's relationship with God is not true love of neighbour. #GospelOfTheDay (Mt 22:34-40) If we want true integral human development for all, war must be avoided, ensuring the rule of law and tireless recourse to negotiation and arbitration. The United Nation \u2019s Charter applies transparently and sincerely, and is an reference point of justice and a peace. #UNDay Life without fraternal gratuitousness becomes a form of frenetic commerce, constantly weighing what we give and what we get back. God, instead, gives freely, helping even those who are unfaithful; he \u201cmakes his sun rise on the evil and on the good\u201d (Mt 5:45). #FratelliTutti St #JohnPaulII and his passion for life and fascination with the mystery of God, of the world and of humankind was an extraordinary gift of God to the Church. Let us remember his faith: may it be an example to lives as witnesses today. So often today man does not know what is within him, in the depths of his mind and heart.... Therefore, let Christ speak to man. He alone has words of life, of eternal life. #StJohnPaulII Prayer is the centre of life. If there is prayer, even a brother, a sister, becomes important. Those who adore God, love His children. Those who respect God, respect human beings. #GeneralAudience To all believers, and to men and women of good will, we say: let us become creative artisans of peace, let us build social friendship, let us make our own the culture of dialogue. #Peaceandfraternity https://t.co/BZ8MiOUZXI \u201cEnough!\u201d says Jesus (Lk 22:38), when his disciples produce two swords before the Passion. \u201cEnough!\u201d That single word of Jesus echoes through the centuries and reaches us forcefully in our own time: enough of swords, weapons, violence and war! The \u201cgospel\u201d of save yourself is not the Gospel of salvation. It is the falsest of the apocryphal gospels, making others carry the cross. Whereas the true Gospel bids us take up the cross of others. #Peaceandfraternity Our present gathering represents an incentive to religious leaders and to all believers to pray fervently for peace, never resigned to war, but working with the gentle strength of faith to end conflicts. #Peaceandfraternity https://t.co/t70L2MRihi I invite you again to take the #Rosary and lift up your gaze to Our Lady, sign of consolation and sure hope. One million children around the world are doing this today, as they pray for unity and peace. #ChildrenPraying Belonging to Christ, and the resulting way of life, do not isolate the believer from the world, but rather make him or her the protagonist in a service of love for the common good. The mission, the \u2018Church on the move\u2019, is not a programme to be carried out by sheer force of will. It is Christ who makes the Church go out of herself. In the mission of evangelization, you move because the Holy Spirit pushes you, and carries you. #WorldMissionDay Today and tomorrow, one million children around the world pray the Rosary. May we confidently recite the #Rosary every day. It is a weapon that protects us from evil and temptation. #ChildrenPraying We need to develop the awareness that nowadays we are either all saved together or no one is saved. #Poverty, decadence and suffering in one part of the earth are a breeding ground for problems that will end up affecting the entire planet. #FratelliTutti #EndPoverty A courageous decision? Using the money spent on weapons for a \u201cglobal Fund\u201d to defeat hunger. This would help avoid many wars and the emigration of many of our brothers and sisters from the poorest nations. Hunger is not only a tragedy for humanity, it is shameful. Faced with this reality, we cannot remain insensitive or paralyzed. We are all responsible. #WorldHungerDay Education bears within itself a seed of hope: the hope of peace and justice; the hope of beauty and goodness; the hope of social harmony. #GlobalCompactOnEducation https://t.co/12UM7BZOgp It is time to subscribe to a global pact on education for and with future generations. This requires commitment from families, communities, schools, universities, institutions, religions, governments, and the human family to train mature men and women. #GlobalCompactOnEducation Today we recall Saint #TeresaOfJesus, master of #prayer. She teaches us that prayer is an expression of friendship with God who always loves us. With God nothing can disturb or frighten us, because \"God alone suffices.\" In #Prayer, we place our worries and petitions in the hands of God, and we trust that He will listen, for He knows what we need and will give us what is good for us. #GeneralAudience Tenderness is love that draws near and becomes real. A movement that starts from our heart and reaches the eyes, the ears and the hands. Tenderness is the path of choice for the strongest, most courageous men and women. #FratelliTutti The witness of Blessed Carlo Acutis indicates to today's young people that true happiness is found by putting God in first place and serving Him in our brothers and sisters, especially the least. I am near to those people affected by wildfires: on the West Coast of the United States, especially California, the central regions of South America, the Pantanal area, Paraguay, the banks of the Paran\u00e1 River, and Argentina. May the Lord sustain them. It is not enough to accept the invitation to follow the Lord; one must be open to a journey of conversion, which changes the heart. The garment of mercy, which God offers us unceasingly, is the free gift of his love; it is grace. # GospelOfTheDay Appearances notwithstanding, every person is immensely holy and deserves our love. Consequently, if I can help at least one person to have a better life, that already justifies the offering of my life. #FratelliTutti We achieve fulfilment when we break down walls and our hearts are filled with faces and names.  #FratelliTutti Every person has the right to live with dignity and to develop him or herself completely, even if they were born with or grew up with limitations. For the immense dignity of the human person is not based on circumstances but on the intrinsic worth of their being. #FratelliTutti All Christians and people of good will are today called to work not only for the abolition of the death penalty in all its forms, but also to work for the improvement of prison conditions, out of respect for the human dignity of persons deprived of their freedom. Our love for others, for who they are, moves us to seek the best for their lives. Only by cultivating this way of relating to one another will we make possible a social friendship that excludes no one and a fraternity that is open to all. #FratelliTutti All of us, as believers, need to recognize that love takes first place: love must never be put at risk, and the greatest danger lies in failing to love (cf. 1 Cor 13:1-13). #FratelliTutti https://t.co/7voH7bULco The process of building fraternity, be it local or universal, can only be undertaken by spirits that are free and open to authentic encounters. #FratelliTutti Belief in God, and the worship of God are not enough to ensure that we actually live in a way pleasing to God. The guarantee of an authentic openness to God is a way of practising the faith that helps open our hearts to our brothers and sisters. #FratelliTutti The journey of fraternity has a Mother. In the power of the risen Lord, she wants to give birth to a new world, where all of us are brothers and sisters, where there is room for all our societies discard, where justice and peace are resplendent. #OurLadyOfTheRosary #FratelliTutti As believers, we are convinced that, without an openness to the Father of all, there will be no solid and stable reasons for an appeal to fraternity. #FratelliTutti The proof of #prayer is real love for our neighbour. #GeneralAudience Let us dream, as a single human family, as fellow travelers sharing the same flesh, as children of the same earth which is our common home, each of us bringing the richness of his or her beliefs and convictions, each of us with his or her own voice, brothers and sisters all. It is my desire that, in this our time, by acknowledging the dignity of each human person, we can contribute to the rebirth of a universal aspiration to fraternity. #FratelliTutti We cannot be indifferent to suffering; we cannot allow anyone to go through life as an outcast. Instead,we should feel indignant,challenged to emerge from our comfortable isolation and to be changed by our contact with human suffering.That is the meaning of dignity #FratelliTutti By his actions, the Good Samaritan showed that the existence of each and every individual is deeply tied to that of others: life is not simply time that passes; life is a time for interactions. #FratelliTutti To care for the world in which we live means to care for ourselves. Yet we need to think of ourselves more and more as a single family dwelling in a common home. #SeasonOfCreation #FratelliTutti #SaintFrancisofAssisi, this saint of fraternal love, simplicity and joy, who inspired me to write the Encyclical Laudato Si\u2019, prompts me once more to devote this new Encyclical to fraternity and social friendship. #FratelliTutti Encyclical #FratelliTutti  https://t.co/c89aZACfGa https://t.co/TRJktiKntO The parable of the murderous vinedressers (Mt 21:33-43) is an admonition for all times, including our own. The vineyard is the Lord's, not ours. And God awaits the fruit of His vineyard from those He has sent to work in it. #GospelOfTheDay #SaintFrancisofAssisi, faithful to Scripture, invites us to see nature as a magnificent book in which God speaks to us and grants us a glimpse of his infinite beauty and goodness. #SeasonOfCreation I offer this social Encyclical as a modest contribution to continued reflection, in the hope that in the face of present-day attempts to eliminate or ignore others, we may prove capable of responding with a new vision of fraternity and social friendship. #FratelliTutti https://t.co/P3qso8k8qM The effort to build a more just society implies the capacity of fraternity, a spirit of human communion. #SeasonOfCreation #FratelliTutti The urgent challenge to protect our common home includes the task of uniting the entire human family in searching for sustainable and integral development, for we know that things can change. #SeasonOfCreation Let us continue to grow in the awareness that we all live in a common home as members of a single family! #SeasonOfCreation #SaintThereseOfLisieux invites us to practise the little way of love, not to let the possibility of offering a smile to slip by, or any small gesture that sows peace and friendship. #SeasonOfCreation Let us not go back to the \"normality\" sick with with injustice, inequality and environmental degradation.The normality to which we are called is that of the Kingdom of God, where there is bread for all and the social organisation is based on contributing, sharing and distributing Devotion to sacred Scripture, a \u201cliving and tender love\u201d for the written word of God: this is the legacy that Saint Jerome bequeathed to the Church by his life and labours. https://t.co/OSaNDBkcIs Saint Michael, help us in the battle for salvation we are fighting. Saint Gabriel, bring us the good news that Jesus has saved us, and grant us hope. Saint Raphael, take our hands and help us along on the path of complete healing. #ArchangelSaints Almighty God, present in the entire universe and in the smallest of Your creatures, fill us with the strength of Your love so that we might take care of life and beauty. #SeasonOfCreation The #GospelOfTheDay questions the way of living a Christian life, which is not made up of dreams or beautiful aspirations, but of concrete commitments, to open ourselves ever more to God's will and to love for our brothers and sisters. Today we celebrate the Memorial of #StVincentDePaul, Patron of charitable organizations. May St Vincent's example lead all of us to joyful and disinterested service to the most in need, and open us to hospitality and the gift of life. Let\u2019s pray for the millions of internally displaced people. Just like Jesus and his parents who fled to Egypt, they live with fear, uncertainty and unease. #WDMR2020 #DisplacedlikeJesus @M_RSection We see the face of Jesus in the faces of the hungry, the thirsty, the naked, the sick, strangers and prisoners; Christ calls us to help. #WDMR2020 #DisplacedlikeJesus @M_RSection https://t.co/ir1lVA2zZp Let us ask the Lord for the gift of peace, for a world without arms of mass destruction! Let us dedicate ourselves to free humanity from nuclear arms, this serious threat to the human race. I urge civil authorities to be especially attentive to children who are denied their fundamental rights and dignity, particularly their right to life and to schooling. #UN75 @UN https://t.co/VUTkbiHxc8 We need to dismantle the perverse logic that links personal and national security to the possession of weaponry. This logic serves only to increase the profits of the arms industry, while fostering a climate of distrust and fear between persons and peoples. #UN75 @UN I renew my appeal that in light of the present circumstances, that all nations be enabled to meet the greatest needs of the moment, reducing or forgiving the debt of the poorest nations. #UN75 @UN The #pandemic has shown us that we cannot live without one another. The United Nations was established to bring nations together, to be a bridge between peoples.  Let us make good use of it to build together the future we all desire. #UN75 @UN Everyone\u2019s talents and involvement are needed to redress the damage caused by human abuse of God\u2019s creation. #SeasonOfCreation The destruction of the human environment is extremely serious, not only because God has entrusted the world to us, but because human life is itself a gift which must be defended. #SeasonOfCreation #Solidarity needs subsidiarity. There is no true solidarity without social participation, without the contribution of families, associations, cooperatives, small businesses, and other expressions of society. #GeneralAudience Life is grounded in three fundamental and closely connected relationships: the Relationship with God, with our neighbour and with the earth. #SeasonOfCreation The journey of reconciliation calls for patience and trust. #Peace will not be obtained unless it is hoped for. We need to pursue a genuine fraternity based on our common origin from God. The desire for #peace lies deep within the human heart, and we should not resign ourselves to seeking anything less than this. Those who reason using human logic, that is, the logic of the merits acquired through one\u2019s own greatness, from being first, find themselves last. Instead, those who humbly entrust themselves to the Father\u2019s mercy, from being last, find themselves first (see Mt 20:1-16) We are called to be instruments of God our Father, so that our planet might be what He dreamed of when he created it and correspond with his plan for peace, beauty and fullness. #SeasonOfCreation Everyone is important in God\u2019s eyes, everyone can transform a part of the world polluted by human voracity into the good reality willed by the Creator. #SeasonOfCreation Today, the nature that surrounds us is no longer admired, but \u201cdevoured\u201d. We must return to contemplation; so as not to be distracted by a thousand useless things, we must find silence; for the heart not to become sick, we must be still. #SeasonOfCreation To contemplate and to care: these are two attitudes that show the way to correct and rebalance our relationship as human beings with creation. #SeasonOfCreation #GeneralAudience\nhttps://t.co/T6xMjO5jnz Contemplation, which leads us to an attitude of care, is not a question of looking at nature from the outside, as if we were not immersed in it. But we are inside nature, we are part of nature. #SeasonOfCreation #GeneralAudience As many spiritual masters have taught us, heaven, earth, sea, and every creature have an iconic capacity or mystical capacity to bring us back to the Creator and to communion with creation. #SeasonOfCreation #GeneralAudience Climate restoration is of utmost importance for the Earth's future. Thus, I invite all nations to adopt more ambitious national targets to reduce emissions. #SeasonOfCreation The Sorrowful Virgin whose pierced heart mourned the death of Jesus now grieves for the sufferings of the crucified poor and for the creatures of this world laid waste by human power. #SeasonOfCreation The revelation of God\u2019s love for us seems madness. Every time that we look at the cross, we find this love. The crucifix is truly the great book of God\u2019s love. #ExaltationOfTheCross In recent days, a series of fires have devastated the refugee camp of Moria on the Island of Lesbos. I express my solidarity and closeness to all the victims of these dramatic events. How much suffering, how many wounds, how many wars could be avoided if forgiveness and mercy were the style of our life! #GospelOfTheDay In the #GospelOfTheDay (MT 18:21-35), Jesus exhorts us to open ourselves courageously to the strength of forgiveness, because not everything in life can be resolved with justice: there's a need for merciful love. Nature is filled with words of love, but how can we listen to them amid constant noise, and interminable and nerve-wracking distractions? #SeasonOfCreation As believers, we do not look at the world from without but from within, conscious of the bonds with which the Father has linked us to all beings. #SeasonOfCreation Today, in the tragedy of a #pandemic, in the face of the many false securities that have now crumbled, in the face of so many hopes betrayed, in the sense of abandonment that weighs upon our hearts, Jesus says to each one of us: \u201cCourage, open your heart to my love\u201d. The common good requires everyone\u2019s participation. If everyone contributes his or her part, and if no one is left out, we can regenerate good relationships on the communitarian, national and international level and even in harmony with the environment. #LaudatoS\u00ec To love everyone, including enemies, is difficult \u2013 I would say it is even an art! But an art that can be learned and improved. True love, that makes us fruitful and free, is always expansive and inclusive. This love cares, heals and does good. #GeneralAudience A virus that does not recognise barriers, borders, or cultural or political distinctions must be faced with a love without barriers, borders or distinctions. #GeneralAudience https://t.co/NM4r1XnNyw The Christian response to the pandemic and to the consequent socio-economic crisis is based on love, above all, love of God who always precedes us (see 1 Jn 4:19). When we welcome this divine love, then we can respond similarly. #GeneralAudience Mary, the Mother who cared for Jesus, cares with maternal affection and pain also for this wounded world. Rather than a problem to be solved, the world is a joyful mystery to be contemplated with gladness and praise. #SeasonOfCreation #LaudatoS\u00ec At times it takes greater love to rehabilitate a brother or sister. In the #GospelOfTheDay (Mt 18:15-20) Jesus invites us to put them in God's hands: only the Father can show a greater love than that of all brothers and sisters put together. Mother Teresa, tireless worker of charity, pray for us, so that our criterion for action might be gratuitous love, offered freely to everyone without distinction of language, culture, race, or religion. During this #SeasonOfCreation, may we be attentive to the rhythms of creation. The world was made to communicate the glory of God, to help us to discover the Lord of all in its beauty, and to return to Him. https://t.co/fXEUjNS03k Today we hear the voice of creation admonishing us to return to our rightful place in the natural created order \u2013 to remember that we are part of this interconnected web of life, not its masters. #SeasonOfCreation I invite everyone to join in a universal day of prayer and fasting for Lebanon, on 4 September. I also invite our brothers and sisters of other religious confessions to join in this initiative in whatever way they deem best. https://t.co/2DmrpIJ0XI As a human family we have our common origin in God. We dwell in a common home, the garden-planet where God placed us. But when we forget all this, our social fabric is weakened and the environment deteriorates. #GeneralAudience The current pandemic has highlighted our interdependence: we are all linked to each other, for better or for worse. Therefore, to come out of this crisis better than before, we have to do so together, all of us, in solidarity. #GeneralAudience A #JubileeForTheEarth is a time to restore the original harmony of creation and to heal strained human relationships. #SeasonOfCreation https://t.co/vEtfVqy8tP A #JubileeForTheEarth is a time to return to God, our loving Creator. We cannot live in harmony with creation if we are not at peace with the Creator who is the source and origin of all things. A #JubileeForTheEarth is a good time to remember creation\u2019s original vocation to exist as a community of love. We exist only in relationships: with God the Creator, with our brothers and sisters, and with all of God\u2019s creatures within our common home. The #JubileeForTheEarth calls us to think once again of our fellow human beings, especially the poor and the most vulnerable. We are asked to re-appropriate God\u2019s original and loving plan of creation as a common heritage. https://t.co/vEtfVqPJSp Today marks the World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation. From now until October 4th we will celebrate the #JubileeForTheEarth with our Christian brothers and sisters of various Churches and traditions. #SeasonOfCreation #SeasonOfCreation https://t.co/7zqYT5xUPY I follow with concern the tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean area and I appeal for constructive dialogue and respect for international law to resolve the conflicts that threaten the peace of the peoples of that region. For Peter and the other disciples \u2013 but for us too! - the cross is a 'hindrance', whereas Jesus considers the 'hindrance' escaping the cross, which would mean avoiding the Father's will, the mission that the Father has entrusted to Him for our salvation. #GospelOfTheDay Putting the paschal mystery at the center of our lives means feeling compassion towards the wounds of the crucified Christ present in the many innocent victims of wars and violence, in attacks on life, in environmental disasters, and in poverty. Trust in the Lord and make an effort to enter into his plans, accepting that His salvation can reach us in ways that may be different from what we expect. We must always have this \u201choly restlessness\u201d in our hearts, in the search for the true good who is God. Let us help others feel the thirst for God. He gives peace and happiness to our hearts. If we take care of the goods that the Creator gives us, if we put what we possess in common in such a way that no one would be lacking, then we would truly inspire hope to regenerate a more healthy and equal world. #GeneralAudience After the crisis, will we continue with this economic system of social injustice and depreciating care for the environment, of creation, of our common home?  Let\u2019s think about this. #GeneralAudience https://t.co/VbjiYe3Kal The root of every spiritual error is believing ourselves to be righteous. To consider ourselves righteous is to leave God, the only righteous one, out in the cold. Today is the tenth anniversary of the massacre of 72 migrants in Mexico. I express my solidarity with the families of the victims who today are still asking for truth and justice. The Lord will hold us to account for all of the migrants who have fallen on their journey of Hope. To pray is to allow yourself to be looked at by God without illusions, excuses, or justifications. Because from the devil come darkness and lies, from God come light and truth. Let\u2019s not forget the victims of the coronavirus. So much suffering, so many people who lost their lives; and so many volunteers, doctors, nurses, sisters, priests, who also lost their lives. Let us remember the families who have suffered because of this. In the #GospelOfTheDay, we hear Jesus\u2019s question directed to each one of us: \u201cAnd you, who do you say I am?\u201d. It is a question of giving not a theoretical answer, but one that involves faith, that is, life, because faith is life! God does not love you because you behave well. He loves you, plain and simple. His love is unconditional; it does not depend on you. God has no need to be defended by anyone and does not want His name to be used to terrorize people. We call upon everyone to stop using religions to incite hatred, violence, extremism and blind fanaticism. #HumanFraternity Amid so many passing things, the Lord wants to remind us of what will remain forever: love, because \u201cGod is love\u201d. May the Holy Spirit make us grow constantly in knowledge of God so that we might spread His love and His truth in the world. The response to the pandemic is dual: we need to find a cure for this small which has brought the whole world to its knees and we must cure a larger virus, that of social injustice. #GeneralAudience Wealth can force us to build walls. Jesus, instead, invites His disciples to transform goods and riches into relationships, because people are worth more than things, they are more valuable than any riches we possess. It is not the wealthy who bear fruit in life, but those who build and maintain many friendships through various \"riches\", namely, through the various gifts God has given them. If we present our poverty to the Lord, with an existence marked by tears and suffering, but with the tenacious faith of the Canaanite woman (see Mt 15:21-28) then the Lord cannot but welcome our prayer with His paternal eyes and heart. #GospelOfTheDay Let us invoke the intercession of the \u201cMother of hope\u201d for all the situations in the world that are most in need of hope, in particular for the population of the northern region of Nigeria, victim of violence and terrorist attacks. With God, nothing is lost! In Mary, the goal has been reached and we have before our eyes the reasons why we journey: not to gain the things here below, which are fleeting, but the homeland above, which is for ever. Hope needs patience, the patience of knowing that we sow, but it is God who gives growth. When we pray, God expects that we also be mindful of those who do not think as we do, those who have slammed the door in our face, those whom we find it hard to forgive. Only prayer unlocks chains, only prayer paves the way to unity. The coronavirus is not the only disease to be fought, but rather, the pandemic has shed light on broader social ills. One of these is a distorted view of the person, a perspective that ignores the dignity and relational character of the person. #GeneralAudience God does not choose us because of our \u201cgoodness\u201d, but precisely because we are and we feel small. We are born with a seed of dissatisfaction in search of fulfillment. Our heart, even without knowing it, thirsts for the encounter with God and seeks it, many times taking the wrong road. When our dissatisfaction encounters Jesus, the life of grace begins. Let us again pray for #Lebanon: after the catastrophe, for its particular identity, fruit of the encounter of different cultures, that with God\u2019s help and everyone\u2019s genuine participation, it may be reborn free and strong. Having faith means keeping your heart turned to God, to His love, to His Fatherly tenderness, amid the storm. Jesus wanted to teach this to Peter and the disciples, and also to us today (Mt 14:22-33). #GospelOfTheDay We are all in need of the Father who extends His hand to us. To pray to Him, to invoke Him, is not an illusion. Illusion is to think we can do without Him! Prayer is the soul of hope. Men and women of #Prayer bear the reflection of light on their faces. Even on the darkest days the sun does not cease to illuminate them. On the 75th anniversary of the atomic explosion at Hiroshima, let us remember that resources used in the arms race could and should be used instead to promote integral human development and to protect the natural environment. #Hiroshima75 Let us keep our eyes fixed on the resplendent face of God, whom we contemplate in Christ transfigured on Mount Tabor. He is the light that illuminates the events of every day. #Transfiguration In the next few weeks, I invite you to tackle together the pressing questions that the pandemic has brought to the fore, social ills above all. And we will do it in the light of the Gospel, of the theological virtues and of the principles of the Church\u2019s social doctrine. Let us pray for the victims of the explosions in Beirut and for their families; and let us pray for Lebanon so that, through the dedication of all its social, political and religious elements, it might face this extremely tragic and painful moment. https://t.co/jA6ek4I1KO Dear brother priests, let us ask the Lord that we be men whose lives bear witness to the compassion and mercy that Jesus alone can bestow on us. #HolyCureOfArs Let's look at the \"saints next door\" who, with simplicity, respond to evil with good, have the courage to love their enemies and to pray for them. How important it is to put God\u2019s forgiveness, which \u2018generates heaven\u2019 in us and around us, back at the centre! #PardonOfAssisi With the miracle of the multiplication of the loaves (see Mt 14:13-21), Jesus wants to educate His friends, both then and now, about God\u2019s logic: the logic of taking responsibility for others. #GospelOfTheDay #SaintIgnatius teaches us humility. Humility makes us aware that it is not we who build the Kingdom of God, but always the Lord\u2019s grace which acts within us. We are fragile clay vessels, yet we bear and communicate an immense treasure. #Friendship is one of life\u2019s gifts and a grace from God. Faithful friends, who stand at our side in times of difficulty, are a reflection of the Lord\u2019s love, His gentle and consoling presence in our lives. Trafficking in persons still constitutes an open wound on the body of contemporary society. I offer heartfelt thanks to all those who work on behalf of the innocent victims of the commodification of the human person. Much remains to be done! #EndHumanTrafficking Men and women who pray know that hope is stronger than discouragement. They believe that love is more powerful than death, and that love will surely triumph one day, even if it be in times and ways we do not know. #Prayer When someone offers us a service, we should not think that we deserve everything. Gratitude, appreciation is, first of all, good manners, but it is also a characteristic of a Christian. It is a simple but genuine sign of the Kingdom of God. On the memorial of the Saints Joachim and Anne, Jesus's \u201cgrandparents\u201d, I would like to invite young people to do something tender towards the elderly, especially the loneliest, in their homes or residences. Dear young people, each elderly person is your grandparent! The Kingdom of Heaven is the opposite of the superfluous things the world offers, the opposite of a dull life: it is a treasure that renews everyday life and leads it to extend towards wider horizons. #GospelOfTheDay The true pilgrim is capable of going at the pace of the slowest person. And Jesus is capable of this. Jesus is our pilgrim companion. He respects our situation, and does not accelerate the pace. He is the Lord of patience. Prophecy is born whenever we allow ourselves to be challenged by God, not when we are concerned to keep everything quiet and under control. When love for parents and children is inspired and purified by love for the Lord, it then becomes wholly fruitful and produces good fruits within the #family itself and well beyond it. In the parable of the weeds from the #GospelOfTheDay (Mt 13:24-43), Jesus helps us understand God\u2019s patience, opening our hearts to hope. #OurLadyOfMountCarmel, our mother, help us to have innocent hands and a pure heart, and not to utter lies or speak ill of our neighbor. Then we will be able to go up to the mountain of the Lord and obtain His blessing, His justice, and His salvation. On the Day of Judgment we will not be judged for our ideas, but for the compassion we have shown to others. On this #SeaSunday, we entrust to the Virgin Mary, Star of the Sea, all maritime personnel, fishermen, and their families. They have made many sacrifices \u2013 even during the lockdown \u2013 to continue working to provide us with food and other primary needs. The #GospelOfTheDay (Mt 13:1-23) recalls that the Word of God is a fruitful and effective seed that God scatters generously everywhere. If we want, we can become good soil, ploughed and carefully cultivated, to help ripen the seed of the Word. Making it fruitful depends on us. #SaintBenedict, Patron of Europe, show us Christians of today how joyful hope always springs from faith, and how this can change the world. Faith is either missionary or it is no faith at all. Faith takes us out of ourselves and toward others. Faith must be transmitted, not to convince but to offer a treasure. Let us ask the Lord to help us live our faith with open doors: a transparent faith. On the anniversary of my visit to #Lampedusa, let us pray that we might discover the face of Jesus in all people forced to flee their homeland because of the many injustices that continue to afflict our world. @M_RSection Faith makes us walk with Jesus on the roads of this world, in the certainty that the power of His Spirit will bend the forces of evil, subjecting them to the power of God\u2019s love. The United Nations has called for an immediate, global ceasefire in order to face the Covid-19 pandemic and provide humanitarian aid. I hope this Resolution will be implemented quickly for the good of those who suffer and become a first step toward a future of peace. In the #GospelOfTheDay (Mt 11:25-30), Jesus praises the Father, because He has hidden the secrets of His Kingdom \"from the wise and the learned\" and revealed them to the \"little ones\", who long for Him and expect everything from Him. In some places, #cooperatives are being developed to exploit renewable sources of energy which ensure local self-sufficiency. They can make a real difference in the fight against climate change, thanks to a strong sense of community and a deep love for the land. Christian joy flows from listening to, and accepting, the Good News of the death and resurrection of Jesus. Whoever believes this message knows that life is born of the love of God the Father. https://t.co/8QN3ZZlcMs Evil never gives peace. It causes frenzy first then leaves bitterness. Instead, God\u2019s voice never promises cheap, easily acquired joy. He invites us to go beyond our ego to find that true good: peace. Today we commemorate the first martyrs of the Church of Rome. They have left us an inheritance to protect and imitate: the Gospel of love and mercy. The Christian martyrs of every period are men and women of peace, despite persecution. Today the Fourth Conference of the European Union and the United Nations to \u201csupport the future of Syria and the region\u201d takes place. Let us pray for this meeting, so that it might place above everything the good of peoples who need food, health care, education, work. Today we are united in a special way with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Peter and Andrew were brothers. Whenever possible, we exchange fraternal visits on our respective feast days, as we journey together towards the goal that the Lord desires: full unity. The proud Saul became Paul, a name that means \u201csmall\u201d. The Lord shook him. He shattered Paul\u2019s illusion of being respectably religious to make him His instrument. https://t.co/8kMZVJ4oL1 Just as the Lord transformed Simon into Peter, so He calls each one of us, to make us living stones with which to build a renewed Church and a renewed humanity. On the feast of the Apostles Peter and Paul, I would like to share two key words: unity and prophecy. The Lord asks each of us: \u201cDo you want to be a builder of unity? Do you want to be a prophet of my heaven on earth?\u201d Let's find the courage to answer: \u201cYes, I do!\u201d I invite everyone to pray for the people of Yemen, especially children, who are suffering as a result of the very serious humanitarian crisis, and for those affected by the severe floods in Western Ukraine. God\u2019s generous gratitude takes into account even the smallest gesture of love and service given to our brothers and sisters. Jesus teaches us this in #TheGospelOfTheDay (Mt 10:42). Jesus says to His disciples: \u201cWhoever does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me\u201d (Mt 10:38). There is no true love without the cross, without a personal price to pay. When borne with Jesus, the cross is not scary because He's always at our side to help us. If you are looking for meaning in life but, not finding one, you throw yourself away with \"imitations of love\", such as wealth, career, pleasure, or an addiction, let Jesus look at you, and you will discover you have always been loved. Only those who see with the heart see things well, because they know how to \u201clook into\u201d each person: to see a brother or sister apart from his or her mistakes, hope amid difficulty. They see God everywhere. Let us begin anew from the numerous examples of generous, freely-given love, which in these months have shown us how much closeness, care, and sacrifice are needed to nourish fraternity and civil coexistence. In this way, we will emerge from this crisis stronger. In these difficult times, your work as maritime personnel and fishermen has become even more important. Today I would like to offer you a message of hope, comfort and consolation. #SeafarersAreKeyWorkers https://t.co/qZLcgceiuY #Prayer arises from the conviction that life is not something that takes us by surprise, but a stupefying mystery that inspires in us poetry, music, gratitude, praise, even lament and supplication. #GeneralAudience The birth of #JohnTheBaptist to elderly parents teaches us that God does not rely on our reasoning and limited human abilities. We must learn to trust, to be silent before the mystery of God, and to contemplate His works in humility and silence. God created us for communion, for fraternity. Now more than ever the pretense of focusing everything on ourselves, making individualism society\u2019s guiding principle, has proven illusory. We have to be careful! When the emergency is over we can easily fall back into this illusion. The Word of God is given to us as the Word of life, which transforms, renews, and does not judge in order to condemn, but heals and has forgiveness as its aim. A Word that is light for our steps! In this Sunday's Gospel (Mt 10:26-33) Jesus invites us not to be afraid, to be strong and confident in the face of life's challenges, because even when we encounter setbacks, our lives rest firmly in God\u2019s hands, who loves us and takes care of us. Dear young people, let us ask for the grace of a new heart through the intercession of your patron #StAloysiusGonzaga, a courageous young man who never retreated from serving others, to the point of giving his life to care for plague victims. May the Lord change our hearts! Dear Doctors and Nurses, the world saw how much good you did in a very difficult situation. Even when you were exhausted, you continued dedicating yourselves with professionalism and self-sacrifice. This generates hope. My esteem and sincere thanks go to you! Jesus is present, as He was at the time of Herod, in each person forced to flee to safety. In their faces we are called to see Christ\u2019s face who pleads with us to help. In the end, we will be the ones to thank Him for being able to love and serve. #WorldRefugeeDay I invite you to pray for priests, so that through your prayer the Lord might strengthen their vocation, comfort them in their ministry, and help them always be joyful ministers of the Gospel for all people. #SanctificationOfPriests Today is the International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict. Let us remember that women embody within themselves the protection of life, communion, and the desire to care for all things. The way we treat women\u2019s bodies reveals our level of humanity. The Lord always watches over us with mercy. Let us not be afraid of approaching him! He has a merciful heart! If we show him our inner wounds, our inner sins, he will always forgive us. It is pure mercy! Let us go to Jesus! #SacredHeartofJesus The Lord cannot enter into hard or ideological hearts. The Lord enters into hearts that are like His: hearts that are open and compassionate. To pray means to intercede for the world, to remember that despite all its frailties, it always belongs to God. #GeneralAudience #Prayer The Lord urges us to remember, repair, rebuild, and to do so together, never forgetting those who suffer. Our principle of unity is the Holy Spirit who reminds us that above all we are God\u2019s beloved children. He comes to us, in our differences and difficulties to tell us that we have one Lord, Jesus, and one Father. For this reason we are brothers and sisters! The #Covid19 pandemic has shown that our societies are not organized well enough to make room for the elderly, with proper respect for their dignity and frailty. When the elderly are not cared for, there is no future for the young. #WEAAD2020 World Blood Donor Day is an opportunity to encourage society to be in solidarity with those in need. I express my appreciation to all those who perform this simple but very important act of helping others. #WBDD2020 I urge international bodies and those who have political and military responsibilities to search for a path to peace in #Libya. I pray for the thousands of migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons and call on the international community to take their plight to heart. In the Eucharist, Jesus draws close to us. Let us not turn away from those around us, those who hunger for food and dignity, those without work, and those who struggle to carry on. Genuine closeness is needed, as are true bonds of solidarity. https://t.co/aFYP6HCrbX The Lord, offering himself to us in the simplicity of bread,invites us not to waste our lives in chasing the myriad illusions that we think we cannot do without,yet that leave us empty within. The Eucharist satisfies our hunger for material things and kindles our desire to serve. The Lord knows that evil and sins do not define us; they are diseases, infections. And he comes to heal them with the Eucharist, which contains the antibodies to our negative memory. With Jesus, we can become immune to sadness. God knows how weak our memory is, so He has done something remarkable: He left us a memorial. He left us Bread in which He is present, alive and true, with all the flavour of His love. Let us ask for the grace to approach everyone as a brother or sister, and never to regard anyone as an enemy. \u201cStretch forth your hand to the poor\u201d (Sir 6:7). Age-old wisdom has proposed these words as a sacred rule to be followed in life. https://t.co/VrlvpZZc47 If we draw God\u2019s mercy, forgiveness, and tenderness from the #HeartOfJesus, then our heart too will gradually become more patient, more generous, and more merciful. Many children are forced into jobs that are inappropriate for their age, depriving them of their childhood and jeopardizing their integral development. I appeal to institutions to spare no effort to protect minors. #NoChildLabourDay Jesus welcomes sinners and eats with them. The same happens with us, in every Mass, in every church: Jesus is happy to welcome us at His table, where He offers Himself for us. #CorpusDomini In our darkest moments, when we sin or are disoriented, we always have an appointment with God. We do not need to be afraid, because God will change our hearts and give us the blessing reserved for those who allow Him to change them. #GeneralAudience There are two Christian responses to escape the spiral of violence: prayer and the gift of self. The #Beatitudes teach us that God, in order to give Himself to us, often chooses unthinkable paths, perhaps the path of our limitations, of our tears, of our defeats. In many nations #Covid19 continues to claim many victims. I wish to express my closeness to those populations, to the sick and their families, and to all those who care for them. #PrayTogether The feast of the #MostHolyTrinity invites us to let ourselves be fascinated by God\u2019s beauty, goodness and inexhaustible truth. He is humble, near, who became flesh in order to enter into our history, so that every man and woman may encounter Him and have eternal life. The Spirit loves us and knows everyone\u2019s place: for Him, we are not bits of confetti blown about by the wind, but irreplaceable fragments in His mosaic. The Heart of Christ is so great it wants to welcome us all into the revolution of tenderness. Everything is interconnected: Genuine care for our own lives and our relationships with nature is inseparable from fraternity, justice, and faithfulness to others. #LaudatoSi #WorldEnvironmentDay https://t.co/rCvEWjis2l It is important to bring together scientific capabilities \u2013 in a transparent and disinterested way \u2013 in order to guarantee universal access to essential technologies that will enable every person, in every part of the world, to receive healthcare. Let us learn from Abraham to pray with faith: listening, walking, engaging in dialogue to the point of argument, but always willing to accept God's word and to put it into practice. #GeneralAudience We cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form. At the same time, we have to recognize that violence is self-destructive and self-defeating. Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost. Let us pray for reconciliation and peace. We have such need of the light and strength of the Holy Spirit! The Church needs it to walk harmoniously and courageously in the witness of the Gospel. And the entire human family needs it so as to move out of this crisis more united and not more divided. Let us invoke the Holy Spirit. May He might give light and strength to the Church and society in the #Amazon region, sorely tried by the pandemic. I pray for the poorest of that precious Region and the world. And I plead that they may not lack health care. A Church that is mother follows the path of tenderness and compassion. A son or daughter of the Church is therefore meek, tender, smiling, and full of love. #MaryMotherOfTheChurch The Holy Spirit assures us that we are not alone, that God sustains us.  Dear friends, we must give in turn the gift that we have received: we are called to share the comfort of the Spirit, the closeness of God. How I desire that we Christians be more deeply united as witnesses of mercy for the human family so severely tested in these days. Let\u2019s ask the Spirit for the gift of unity, for only if we live as brothers &amp; sisters can we spread the spirit of fraternity. https://t.co/iylzrGvG3F #Mission is a free and conscious response to God\u2019s call. Yet we discern this call only when we have a personal relationship of love with Jesus present in his Church. https://t.co/SK8BbwG9n6 Let\u2019s view the Church with the Spirit\u2019s eyes not with the world\u2019s which sees us on the right or left. The Spirit sees sons &amp; daughters of the Father,Jesus\u2019s brothers &amp; sisters. The world sees conservatives and progressives. The Spirit sees children of God. https://t.co/JixmeFgsHv Come, Holy Spirit: you are harmony; make us builders of unity.  You always give yourself; grant us the courage to go out of ourselves, to love and help each other, in order to become one family. Amen. #Pentecost Holy Spirit, memory of God, revive in us the memory of the gift received.  Free us from the paralysis of selfishness and awaken in us the desire to serve, to do good. #Pentecost From humanity's great trials, among which is the #pandemic, we come out better or worse. We will not be the same. And that is why we open ourselves to the Holy Spirit today so that He might change our hearts and help us to come out better. We need the Holy Spirit to give us new eyes, to open our minds and our hearts to face the present moment and the future having learned this lesson: That humanity is one. No one is saved alone. No one. The Faith provides us with a realistic and creative imagination, capable of abandoning the logic of repetition, of substitution or of preservation; it invites us to initiate a season that is always new: the season of the Lord. Dear brother priests, I want to fraternally share with you all these things that I thought and felt during this time of the pandemic, so that they might help us in our journey of praise for the Lord and of service to our brothers. https://t.co/eWK0mlJaIz The Holy Spirit makes us take flight, opens up the wonderful destiny for which we were born, and nourishes us with living hope. Let us ask Him to come to us, and He will draw near. The Holy Spirit, when we invite Him into our wounds, anoints our painful memories with the balm of hope, because the Spirit restores hope. #Prayer liberates us from our instinct toward violence. It is a gaze directed toward God, so that He might take care of the human heart. #GeneralAudience #PrayTogether https://t.co/aI2CBptvg0 The Holy Spirit transforms us into a Church-womb of mercy, that is, into a \u201cmother with a heart open\u201d to all. Jesus bore our humanity and brought it beyond death to a new place, to Heaven, so that there where He is, we might also be. Today marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of Saint John Paul II\u2019s Encyclical Letter Ut Unum Sint. On this anniversary, I give thanks to the Lord for the journey he has allowed us to travel as Christians in quest of full communion. https://t.co/XQvMtUuaMn God of love, show us our place in this world as channels of your love for all the creatures of this earth, for not one of them is forgotten in your sight. Praise be to you! #LaudatoSi5 Let us entrust to Mary Help of Christians all in this difficult time who work for peace, for dialogue between nations, for service to the poor, for the care of creation, and for the victory of humanity over every disease of body, heart and soul. \u6211\u5011\u628a\u5728\u4e2d\u570b\u7684\u5f1f\u5144\u59ca\u59b9\u8a17\u4ed8\u65bc\u6211\u5011\u5929\u4e0a\u7684\u6bcd\u89aa\u5f15\u9818\u53ca\u5e87\u4f51\uff0c\u9858\u4ed6\u5011\u4fe1\u5fb7\u5805\u6bc5\uff0c\u978f\u56fa\u53cb\u611b\u5718\u7d50\uff0c\u559c\u6a02\u5730\u898b\u8b49\u4e26\u4fc3\u9032\u611b\u5fb7\u8207\u671b\u5fb7\u3002 \u6211\u4eec\u628a\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u5f1f\u5144\u59ca\u59b9\u8a17\u4ed8\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u5929\u4e0a\u7684\u6bcd\u4eb2\u5f15\u9886\u53ca\u5e87\u4f51\uff0c\u613f\u4ed6\u4eec\u4fe1\u5fb7\u575a\u6bc5\uff0c\u5de9\u56fa\u53cb\u7231\u56e2\u7ed3\uff0c\u559c\u4e50\u5730\u89c1\u8bc1\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7231\u5fb7\u4e0e\u671b\u5fb7\u3002 Let us entrust our brother and sister Catholics in China to the guidance and protection of our Heavenly Mother, so that they might be strong in faith and steadfast in fraternal union, joyful witnesses, and promoters of charity and hope. The Feast of the #Ascension tells us that Jesus ascended to Heaven to dwell gloriously at the right hand of the Father and remains always among us. This is the source of our strength, perseverance and joy. Knowledge of the Lord is handed down from generation to generation mainly by telling the story of how He continues to make Himself present. The God of life communicates with us through the story of life. #WorldCommunicationsDay2020 https://t.co/R2qPpcY8fb An integral ecology includes taking time to recover a serene harmony with creation, reflecting on our lifestyle and our ideals, and contemplating the Creator who lives among us and surrounds us. #LaudatoSi5 Care for nature is part of a lifestyle which includes the capacity for living together and communion. Jesus reminded us that we have God as our common Father and that this makes us brothers and sisters. #LaudatoSi5 Men and women of #Prayer safeguard the basic truths. They repeat to everyone that this life, despite all its fatigue, trials, and difficult days, is filled with a grace at which we marvel. As such life must always be defended and protected. Each year sees the disappearance of thousands of plant and animal species which we will never know, which our children will never see. Because of us, thousands of species will no longer give glory to God by their very existence. We have no such right. #Biodiversity #LaudatoSi5 Receiving the joy of the Spirit is a grace. Moreover, it is the only force that enables us to preach the Gospel and to confess our faith in the Lord. Faith means bearing witness to the joy that the Lord gives to us. A joy such as this cannot be the result of our own efforts. The joy of proclaiming the Gospel always shines brightly against the backdrop of a grateful memory. To be \u201cin a state of mission\u201d is a reflection of gratitude. It is the response of one who by gratitude is made docile to the Spirit and is therefore free. https://t.co/BBW9VX8i4v If one follows Jesus, happy to be attracted by Him, others will take notice. They may even be astonished. The joy that radiates from those attracted by Christ and by his Spirit is what can make any missionary initiative fruitful. Jesus told his disciples that he would send them the Spirit, the Comforter, prior to his departure. In this way, he also entrusted the apostolic work of the Church to the Spirit for all time, until his return. #Ascension https://t.co/BBW9VX8i4v This life is the gift that God has given us. It is too short to be spent in sadness. Let us praise God, content simply to exist. We are children of the great King, capable of reading His signature in all Creation. #LaudatoSi5 The human person grows more, matures more and is sanctified more to the extent that he or she enters into relationships, going out from themselves to live in communion with God, with others and with all creatures. #LaudatoSi5 If the events of life \u2013 with all its bitterness \u2013 risk suffocating the gift of #Prayer within us, it is enough to contemplate a starry sky, a sunset, or a flower, to reignite the spark of thanksgiving. #GeneralAudience When we can see God reflected in all that exists, our hearts are moved to praise the Lord for all his creatures and to worship him in union with them. #LaudatoSi5 If we are transparent before the Lord like a crystal, His light \u2013 the light of mercy \u2013 will shine in us and, through us, in the world. All of us can cooperate as instruments of God for the care of creation, each according to his or her own culture, experience, involvements and talents. #LaudatoSi5 Today we remember the great faith and example of #JohnPaulII. Let us hear the echo of his appeal to open wide the doors to Christ, to not be afraid. Let us walk joyfully along the paths of the world, following the footsteps of the giant who has preceded us. We are never alone! https://t.co/1Qfrtzl1D1 100 years ago the Lord visited His people. He sent a pastor. #JohnPaulII was our shepherd in prayer, in closeness to the people, in love for justice that always goes together with mercy. Tomorrow marks the centenary of the birth of Saint John Paul II. Let us remember him with great affection and gratitude. At 7:00 AM, I will celebrate Holy Mass, which will be broadcast all over the world, at the altar where his mortal remains rest. https://t.co/t70L2MRihi I urgently appeal for renewed dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet. We need a conversation which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its human roots, concern and affect us all. #LaudatoSi5 Our society has a sense of being orphaned that touches our sense of belonging and fraternity, because the Father is missing. Let\u2019s ask the Holy Spirit for the grace to rediscover the Father, who gives us a sense of meaning in life. May He make us one family. #HomilySantaMarta Let us #PrayTogether today for those who clean hospitals, streets, who empty dumpsters, who go to each house to remove trash. It\u2019s a job that no one sees, but one that is necessary for our survival. May the Lord bless them. Let us care for all of creation, which is a gift of the good God, our Creator. Let us celebrate Laudato si' Week. #LaudatoSi5 \nhttps://t.co/UwAe8DP79E https://t.co/OF3KTNwNxY What is the spirit of the world that Jesus talks about (Jn 15:18-21)? It is a way of life, a culture of the temporary that doesn't know how to be faithful. Let us ask the Holy Spirit for the grace to discern between what is worldliness and what is evangelical. #HomilySantaMarta Today, let us #PrayTogether for those persons who are burying the dead during this pandemic, risking being infected as well. To bury the dead is one of the works of mercy. In light of the tragic events that have marked 2020, I dedicate my Message for the World Day of Migrants and Refugees \u2013 on internally displaced persons \u2013 to all those experiencing situations of precariousness and marginalization as a result of Covid-19. https://t.co/gePJK3JFyC The perfect path to follow Jesus is not rigidity, which brings turmoil, but the spirit of evangelical freedom, which always brings joy. #HomilySantaMarta Today is the #InternationalDayOfFamilies: Let us pray for all families, so that the Spirit of the Lord - the spirit of love, respect, and freedom - might grow in families. #PrayTogether May God have mercy on us and put an end to this tragedy, this pandemic, as well as the pandemics of hunger, war, and children without an education. This we ask as brothers and sisters, everyone together. #HumanFraternity #PrayTogether All of us \u2013 brothers and sisters of every religious tradition \u2013 unite today for the day of prayer, fasting, and penance called by the Higher Committee for Human Fraternity. #HumanFraternity #PrayTogether #HomilySantaMarta https://t.co/OZrgcDiKLF Prayer belongs to everyone: to men and women of every religion, and probably even to those who profess no religion. Prayer is born within the secrecy of our being, in that interior place that spiritual writers often call the \u201cheart\u201d. #GeneralAudience Mother of the Lord, Virgin Mary, Queen of the Rosary, show us the power of your protective mantle. From your arms come the hope and peace of which we are sorely in need. #OurLadyOfFatima \"Remain in me and I in you\" (Jn 15:4). This \"remaining\" is not passive but active. It is a mutual remaining. \"I am the vine, you are the branches\" (Jn 15:5). We branches need the lymph, and the vine needs the fruit of our witness. #HomilySantaMarta Today is International Nurses Day. Nursing is more than a profession \u2013 it's a vocation, a dedication. During this pandemic, they have given an example of heroism. Some have even given their lives. Let us #PrayTogether for nurses. https://t.co/yl0CodUld3 The peace the world gives isolates us from others. It lulls us to sleep, and is temporary and sterile. The peace the Lord gives is lasting, fruitful, contagious. It makes us go out to create community. It is filled with hope because it looks toward Heaven. #HomilySantaMarta I would like to remind you that on 14 May, believers of every religion are invited to unite themselves spiritually in a day of prayer, fasting and works of charity, to implore God to help humanity overcome the coronavirus #pandemic. #HumanFraternity #PrayTogether What does the Holy Spirit do in us? He reminds us of everything Jesus said. He teaches us to understand it better,to grow in our understanding of the faith. He accompanies and supports us in discernment. He enlightens us in life's decisions,both great and small. #HomilySantaMarta Many people have recently lost their jobs. Let us #PrayTogether for our brothers and sisters who are suffering for lack of employment. Today, many countries are celebrating #MothersDay. I wish to remember all mothers with gratitude and affection, entrusting them to the protection of Mary, our heavenly Mother. Let us also remember those mothers who accompany us from Heaven. In the #GospelOfTheDay (John 14:1-12), Jesus indicates two remedies for being troubled in heart. First: to not depend on ourselves but to have faith in Him. Second: to remember that here we are passing through and that Jesus has reserved us a place in Heaven. #ReginaCaeli It takes courage to pray. To pray is to go with Jesus to the Father who will give us everything. The Church progresses with this courageous prayer, because the Holy Spirit teaches us that we do very little, but it is God who \"does things\" in the Church. #HomilySantaMarta On the 70th anniversary of the Schuman Declaration, I hope that it will continue to inspire those with responsibilities in the European Union. They are called to face the social and economic consequences of the pandemic in a spirit of harmony and cooperation. #EuropeDay2020 The Church strives forward between the consolation of God and the persecution of the world. The Holy Spirit creates harmony within the Church. The evil spirit destroys. Let us place our trust not in temporal power, but in Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. #HomilySantaMarta Today is the commemoration of Saint Luisa de Marillac. Let us #PrayTogether for the Vincentian sisters who have worked here at Santa Marta for nearly 100 years, while running the clinic. Today at the Shrine of Our Lady of Pompei, the faithful lift up an intense prayer of Supplication to #OurLadyOfTheRosary. Let us #PrayTogether so that, through the intercession of the Holy Virgin, the Lord might grant mercy and peace on the Church and the entire world. How does the Lord console? By drawing near, while speaking little. Through truth: He neither speaks formalities nor deceives. Through hope: \"Do not let your hearts be troubled\". The Lord's consolation is near, true, and opens to us the doors of hope. #HomilySantaMarta Today is World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day. Let us #PrayTogether for those people who work in these noteworthy institutions. May the Lord bless their work which does so much good. In the midst of isolation when we are suffering from a lack of tenderness and chances to meet up, and we experience the loss of so many things, let us once again listen to the proclamation that saves us: Christ is risen and is living by our side. To be Christian is to belong to a people freely chosen by God, and to remember those who have preceded us on the journey to salvation. Let us ask the Lord for the awareness of belonging to the people of God which, in its totality, has the sense of the faith. #HomilySantaMarta I would like to ask the Lord to bless artists, who make us understand what beauty is. The Gospel cannot be understood without beauty. Let us #PrayTogether once more for artists. #Prayer is the breath of faith. It is like a cry that comes forth from the heart of the believer and is entrusted to God. Faith is having two raised hands and a voice that cries out to implore the gift of salvation. #GeneralAudience It is not easy to live in the light. The light makes us see many ugly things within us: vices, pride, the worldly spirit. But Jesus tells us: \"Take courage; let yourself be enlightened, because I save you\". Let us not be afraid of Jesus's light! #HomilySantaMarta Let us #PrayTogether for men and women who work in the media. They have risked much and worked tirelessly during this pandemic. May the Lord help them always in their task to transmit the truth. https://t.co/MYp1e4I42y https://t.co/lutQwrwWpB There are certain attitudes that do not allow us to progress in knowledge of the Lord: wealth, apathy, rigidity, clericalism, worldliness... Freedom is lacking, and we cannot follow Jesus without that freedom. #HomilySantaMarta Today we pray for the deceased who have died because of the pandemic. They have died alone, without the caresses of their loved ones. So many did not even have a funeral. May the Lord receive them into His glory. #PrayTogether I welcome the proposal of the Higher Committee for #HumanFraternity that believers of all religions should unite spiritually on 14 May for a day of prayer and fasting, to implore God to help humanity overcome the #coronavirus. #PrayTogether Some ideas cause division to the point that the idea is more important than the Holy Spirit who guides us. May the Lord free us from divisions, and help us understand this great mystery of Jesus: He is everyone's Shepherd, in Him we are all brothers and sisters. #HomilySantaMarta During the quarantine, families try to do a lot of new things. There's so much creativity to keep going. But sometimes there's also domestic violence. Let us #PrayTogether for families, that they might persevere in peace, with creativity and patience during the quarantine. During the current crisis, we need good, free journalism that serves all people, especially those who do not have a voice: journalism that is dedicated to the search for truth and which opens paths toward communion and peace. #WPFD2020 Let us #PrayTogether today for #vocations, asking the Lord for the gift of good workers for His Kingdom, whose hearts and hands are open to His love. https://t.co/Y7eRhi5anC Let us #PrayTogether for the many pastors who give their lives for the faithful.I think often of priests,as well as other pastors who care for the good of the people: doctors. May the example of these shepherds,priests and doctors help us care for the holy,faithful people of God. Good Shepherd Sunday is a beautiful Sunday, one of peace, meekness, and tenderness because our Shepherd cares for us. \"The Lord is my Shepherd, there is nothing I shall want\" (Ps 23). #HomilySantaMarta Let us turn this time of #pandemic into a test case to prepare for our collective future. Without an all-embracing vision, there will be no future for anyone. A crisis is the moment to make a choice. This pandemic is a time of social crisis. How should we react? With perseverance, silence, and fidelity to God and decisions made earlier. A moment of crisis is like passing through fire to become stronger. #HomilySantaMarta Let us #PrayTogether for government leaders who are responsible for taking care of their people. May the Lord grant them strength and teach them that they need to show great unity in moments of crisis for the good of the people, because unity is superior to conflict. Let us rediscover the beauty of praying the #Rosary at home during May! At the end of each Rosary, we can recite a prayer asking for Mary\u2019s intercession, that the Lord might free us from this pandemic and life might serenely resume its normal course. https://t.co/xfItRvjOLV https://t.co/BZRxVxT9Dr \u201cWork\u201d is the word the Bible uses to describe God\u2019s creative activity: \u201cGod completed the work He had been doing\u201d (Gen 2:2). God entrusted this task to mankind: Work is the human vocation. #HomilySantaMarta Today is the feast of St. Joseph the Worker and also International Labour Day. Let us #PrayTogether for all workers, so that no one might be without work and all might be paid a just wage. May all benefit from the dignity of work and the beauty of rest. Christianity is not only a doctrine, a way of behaving, a culture. Yes, it is also these things. But the core of Christianity is an encounter: the encounter with Jesus. A Christian is a person who has encountered Jesus Christ, and was open to that encounter. Our witness opens the way for others. Our prayer opens the door to the Father's heart. Let us ask the Lord that we might live our work with witness and prayer, so that the Father might draw people to Jesus. #HomilySantaMarta Let us #PrayTogether today for those who have died because of the pandemic, and in a special way for the \"anonymous\" dead. Being poor in spirit, mourning, meekness, thirsting for holiness, showing mercy, purity of heart, and being a peacemaker can lead to persecution for Christ\u2019s sake. But in the end, this persecution is a cause for joy and great reward in heaven. #Beatitudes When confessing our sins we must not be abstract, but simple and concrete like children: \"I am a sinner because of this, this and this.\" This leads me to feel ashamed. Being concrete makes me serious rather than vaguely feel a sense of being a sinner. #HomilySantaMarta On the feast of St. Catherine of Siena, Doctor of the Church and Patroness of Europe, let us #PrayTogether for the unity of the European Union, so that we might all move ahead together as brothers and sisters. Easter brings us this message: the message of rebirth. We can be reborn with the same strength that raised up the Lord: with the strength of God. Many times we make comments that set off a small daily lynching. May the Lord help us to be righteous in our judgments and not to begin or follow gossip that provokes an undeserved condemnation. #HomilySantaMarta At this time, as indications emerge for a way out of quarantine, we pray that the Lord will grant us the grace of prudence and obedience to these indications, so that the pandemic does not return. #PrayTogether At times in life we distance ourselves from the Lord and lose the freshness of the first call. Let us ask for the grace to always go back to that first encounter, in which He looked at us, spoke to us, and placed in us the desire to follow Him. #HomilySantaMarta Let us #PrayTogether for artists, who have a great capacity for creativity and show us the path forward through beauty. May the Lord grant each of us the grace of creativity in this moment. The #GospelOfTheDay (Lk 24:13-35) teaches us that two opposite directions are set before us in life: The path of those who let themselves be paralysed by disappointments and trudge along sadly. Then there is the path of those who put Jesus and others before their own problems. What patience the Lord has with each of us! He respects our situation, walks at our side as He did with the disciples of Emmaus, and listens to our dissatisfactions. He respects us. He enjoys listening to how we speak so as to understand us well and give us the correct response. Let us #PrayTogether for all those who are suffering from sadness, because they are alone, do not know what future awaits them, or cannot take care of their family because they have no job. Let us pray for them today. https://t.co/fTs5VpC9FP While we are combating #coronavirus, we must continue the effort to prevent and cure #malaria which threatens millions of persons in many countries. I am near to all who are sick, to those who care for them. Contemplating together the face of Christ with the heart of Mary,as we pray the #Rosary, will make us more united as a spiritual family and will help us to overcome this trial. I will pray for you, especially for those who are suffering the most. Please, pray for me.#PrayTogether Dear brothers and sisters, I offer you the texts of two prayers to Our Lady which you can recite at the end of the #Rosary. I too will recite them during the month of May, uniting myself spiritually to you. #PrayTogether https://t.co/zSmhgaZciV The #GospelOfTheDay contains the Lord's final greeting: \"Go into the whole world and proclaim the Gospel\" (Mk 16:15). Faith always carries us out of ourselves. The faith needs to be transmitted and offered above all with witness. Go out so that people might see how you live. Today the Church celebrates the Feast of St Mark, one of the four Evangelists, the first to write a Gospel. It has a very simple style. If you have time today, read it. The simplicity with which he recounts the Lord's life makes for an enjoyable read. Let us #PrayTogether for those who provide funeral services. What they do is so painful, so sad, and they are touched deeply by the pain of this pandemic. Let us pray for them. As we look ahead to a slow and arduous recovery from the pandemic, the risk is that an even worse virus may strike us: that of a selfish indifference that forgets those who are left behind. Jesus formed the hearts of the Apostles to serve the people.He taught them the pastoral attitude of being near the people of God.Pastoral ministry is not accomplished with structures, but with the heart of a shepherd.Let us #PrayTogether for the Church's pastors.#HomilySantaMarta We pray today for teachers who have to work so hard to take lessons via the internet and other media channels, and we also pray for students who have to take exams in a way they are not used to. Let us accompany them with prayer. https://t.co/0Y5D7NjWkm The pandemic reminds us there are no differences or borders between those who suffer. We are all frail, all equal, all precious. May we be profoundly shaken: Now is the time to eliminate inequalities and heal the injustice undermining the health of the entire human family! Peter's secret weapon is Jesus's prayer. Jesus prays for Peter that his faith might not fail. What He did with Peter He does for all of us. Jesus prays for us before the Father, showing His wounds, the price of our salvation. #HomilySantaMarta There are families in need who cannot work and have nothing to eat. Then along come usurers to take what little they have. Let us #PrayTogether for these families' dignity. And let us pray also for the usurers, that the Lord might touch their hearts and convert them. Earth Day is an occasion to renew our commitment to love our common home, which is not a warehouse to exploit. Let us care for it and for the weakest members of our human family. #EarthDay50 https://t.co/xXv6l6NoIy Let us allow the love of God - who sent His Son Jesus - to enter into us, and help us see with the light of the Spirit. Let us ask ourselves: Do I walk in the light or in darkness? Am I a child of God? Or have I ended up like a poor \"bat\"? #HomilySantaMarta When we are in a state of sin, we are like \"human bats\" who can move about only at night. We find it easier to live in darkness because the light reveals to us what we do not want to see. But then our eyes grow accustomed to darkness and we no longer recognize the light. At this moment in which unity among us is very necessary, let us pray for Europe, so that it might succeed in creating the fraternal unity which the founding fathers drempt of for the European Community. #PrayTogether https://t.co/TeoaP1Z4DK In the time of trial that we are presently undergoing, we experience our frailty. We need the Lord, who sees an irrepressible beauty beyond that frailty. With Him we rediscover how precious we are, even in our vulnerability. Many things can divide communities: money, vanity, gossip. But the Spirit comes to save us from divisions. The Holy Spirit is the Master of harmony. He creates harmony in the community, because He Himself is harmony, the harmony between the Father and the Son. #HomilySantaMarta There's a lot of silence at this moment. May this silence, which is a bit new to what we are accustomed, teach us how to listen. Let us #PrayTogether that we might grow in our ability to listen. https://t.co/MGJaKDFjlG The Christian response to the storms of life and history can only be mercy: compassionate love among us and toward everyone, especially toward those who suffer, who have more difficulties, and are abandoned. To be Christian is not only to fulfill the Commandments, but \"to be born again\" and allow the Spirit to enter in us and carry us wherever He wants. This is the freedom of the Spirit. May the Lord help us always to be docile to the Spirit. #HomilySantaMarta Let us #PrayTogether for the men and women who have a vocation to political life, which is a high form of charity. We pray for political parties in various nations, so that in this pandemic they might together seek the good of the country and not the good of their own party. The Lord waits for us to offer him our failings so that he can help us experience his mercy. #DivineMercySunday https://t.co/ihgfUzEFg7 The faithful and patient mercy of God never tires of reaching out to lift us up when we fall. He wants us to see him, not as a taskmaster with whom we have to settle accounts, but as our Father who always raises us up. #DivineMercySunday Today the simple and disarming love of Jesus revives the heart of Thomas (Jn 20,19-31).  Like the apostle Thomas, let us accept mercy, the salvation of the world.  And let us show mercy to those who are most vulnerable; for only in this way will we build a new world. Where does the Apostles' courage come from? It is a gift of the Holy Spirit. Boldness - courage - is a gift that the Lord gives on the day of Pentecost. The Christian mission is born from this gift of the Holy Spirit. #HomilySantaMarta We remember the difficult task entrusted to healthcare providers, nurses and doctors, in caring for persons with disabilities who have come down with Covid-19. Let us #PrayTogether for persons with disabilities and those who assist them. The disciples had progressed in familiarity with the Lord. May the Lord also teach us this familiarity with Him, which is personal, but always communitarian: a familiarity in everyday life, in the sacraments, in the midst of the people of God. #HomilySantaMarta Let us #PrayTogether for expectant women who will become mothers and who ask themselves: \"What type of world will my child live in?\". May the Lord give them the courage and confidence that it will certainly be a different world, but also one which the Lord will love tremendously. The joy of the Lord is your strength (Neh 8:10). The joy of the Lord is the great strength we possess which drives us to continue being witnesses of life. Today let us ask for the grace of this joy, which is a fruit of the Holy Spirit. #HomilySantaMarta The #GospelOfTheDay (Lk 24:35-48) is one of my favorites: \"Their joy kept them from believing\" (v. 41). To be filled with joy: It is not merely being happy, positive, but is something else. It is to be filled with consolation, filled with the Lord's presence. #HomilySantaMarta Let us #PrayTogether for pharmacists. They are working hard, together with doctors and nurses, to help the sick get better. https://t.co/Xp51CfuurX They are called children of God who have learned the art of peace and exercise it, knowing that there is no reconciliation without the gift of one\u2019s own life, and that peace must be sought always and in every situation. #Beatitudes #GeneralAudience God's faithfulness is a patient fidelity to His people. God listens, guides, explains slowly, and kindles the heart as He did with the two disciples who had traveled far from Jerusalem: He made their hearts burn so they would return home. #HomilySantaMarta Let us #PrayTogether for the elderly, especially those who are isolated or in rest homes and are afraid of dying alone. They are our roots. They gave us the faith, tradition, and a sense of belonging. Let us pray that the Lord might be near to them. Jesus' resurrection shows us that death does not have the last world; life does. Christ has been raised, so it is possible to have a positive outlook on every event of our existence, even the most difficult ones and those charged with anguish and uncertainty. To repent means returning to faithfulness. Today let us ask for the grace to look beyond our own security, and to be faithful even before the tomb and the collapse of so many illusions. Remaining faithful is not easy. May the Lord keep us faithful. #HomilySantaMarta Let us #PrayTogether that the Lord might give us the grace of unity among us. In these difficulties times, may He allow us to discover the communion that binds us and the unity which is greater than any division. https://t.co/NDtmlcEmmH In the #GospelOfTheDay we hear that the women proclaimed Jesus' Resurrection to the disciples. Today I would like to remember the efforts that so many women make to take care of others, even during this health crisis. We will either bet on life, in favor of the resurrection of our people, or we will bet on the god of money, turning back to the tomb of hunger, slavery, war, the making of weapons, of children without an education. #HomilySantaMarta https://t.co/DDxnokvMcX Let us #PrayTogether for government leaders, scientists and politicians who are beginning to study a way out of the pandemic, though its \"aftermath\" has already begun. May they find the right way, always for the good of their people. Dear brothers and sisters, Indifference, self-centredness, division and forgetfulness are not words we want to hear at this time. We want to ban these words for ever! https://t.co/nZzOBsR0J6 In this night, the Church\u2019s voice rings out: \u201cChrist, my hope, is risen!\u201d. This is a different \u201ccontagion\u201d, a message transmitted from heart to heart \u2013 for every human heart awaits this Good News. It is the contagion of hope: \u201cChrist, my hope, is risen!\u201d. Tonight we acquire a fundamental right: the right to hope. It is a new and living hope that comes from God. It is not mere optimism; it is a gift from heaven, which we could not have earned on our own. Let us silence the cries of death, no more wars! Since we need bread, not guns. Let the abortion and killing of innocent lives end. May the hearts of those who have enough be open to filling the empty hands of those who do not have the bare necessities. Do not be afraid, do not yield to fear: This is the message of hope. It is addressed to us, today. These are the words that God repeats to us this very night. Let us direct our gaze to the Man of the Shroud, in whom we recognize the features of the Servant of the Lord, which Jesus accomplished in His Passion. Participate in the prayer before the Holy Shroud through the media at 5 PM: https://t.co/mfPrQND5HJ This Face disfigured by wounds communicates great peace.  His gaze is directed not to our eyes but to our heart, as if to say: Have faith, do not lose hope. The power of the love of God, the power of the Risen One overcomes all things. #HolyShroud https://t.co/9LfmSCtf18 Gaze upon the outstretched arms of Christ crucified, let yourself be saved over and over again. #PrayTogether #GoodFriday https://t.co/nV9MOuzQRb Let us #PrayTogether. Follow the Easter Triduum liturgies:  https://t.co/mfPrQND5HJ https://t.co/dIEImLQ3UW Dear brother priests, we have been anointed to anoint, to give of ourselves. Let us #PrayTogether today asking for the humility to protect this gift of anointing, and imploring God's mercy for the people entrusted to us and for the entire world. #HolyThursday From the open heart of the Crucified one, God\u2019s love reaches each one of us. Let us allow His gaze to rest on us. We will understand that we are not alone, but loved, for the Lord does not abandon us and He never, ever forgets us. #GeneralAudience Let's think of the little Judas that we all have within ourselves. Every one of us is capable of choosing between loyalty and self-interest. We are each capable of betraying, of selling, of making choices based on our own interests. Where are you, Judas? #HomilySantaMarta Let us pray today for the people doing business with those in need during this pandemic, who seek to profit from the needs of others and \"sell\" them. May the Lord touch and convert their hearts. #PrayTogether In these holy days let us stand before the Crucified One and let us ask for the grace to live in order to serve. May we reach out to those who are suffering and those most in need. May we not be concerned about what we lack, but what good we can do for others. There are always times in life when we fall, each one of us is a sinner. But what matters is our attitude before God. We ask for the grace to persevere in service and, when we fall, the grace to weep as Peter wept. #HomilySantaMarta In these days of #Lent, we've been witnessing the persecution that Jesus underwent and how He was judged ferociously, even though He was innocent. Let us #PrayTogether today for all those persons who suffer due to an unjust sentence because of someone had it in for them. The tragedy we are experiencing summons us to take seriously the things that are serious, and not to be caught up in those that matter less; to rediscover that life is of no use if not used to serve others. For life is measured by love. We will be judged on our relationship with the poor. When Jesus says, \"The poor you will always have with you\", he is saying, \"I will always be with you in the poor; I will be present there\". This is at the center of the Gospel, so much so that we will be judged on it. In those prisons that are overcrowded, there is the danger that this pandemic will end up as a grave tragedy. Let us #PrayTogether for those responsible, for those who must make decisions, so that they might find a correct and creative way to resolve this problem. Dear young people, feel called yourselves to put your lives on the line. Do not be afraid to devote your life to God and to others; it pays!For life is a gift we receive only when we give ourselves away, and our deepest joy comes from saying yes to love, without ifs and buts #WYD God saved us by serving us. We often think we are the ones who serve God. No, he is the one who freely chose to serve us, for he loved us first. It is difficult to love and not be loved in return. And it is even more difficult to serve if we do not let ourselves be served by God. Jesus experienced total abandonment in a situation he had never before experienced in order to be one with us in everything. He did it for me, for you, to say to us: \u201cDo not be afraid, you are not alone. I experienced all your desolation in order to be ever close to you\u201d. The Father upheld Jesus in his service.  He did not take away the evil that crushed him, but rather strengthened him in his suffering so that our evil could be overcome by good, by a love that loves to the very end. #PalmSunday https://t.co/oHLhN4fXGI This astonishes us: God saved us by taking upon himself all the punishment of our sins.  Without complaining, but with the humility, patience and obedience of a servant, and purely out of love. #PalmSunday #PrayTogether  https://t.co/0Wrtgv5Cqb https://t.co/A7m5iC9Lx9 By ourselves, we cannot remove the dust that sullies our hearts. Only Jesus, who knows and loves our heart, can heal it. #Lent is a time of healing. We should adopt the habit of examining the process of temptation in ourselves, which changes our hearts from good to bad: How did the process begin in my soul? How did it grow?... May the Holy Spirit enlighten us to have this interior awareness. #HomilySantaMarta In these painful times, people think of doing many good things. But others think of how they can take advantage of the situation to profit personally from it. Let us #PrayTogether that the Lord might grant an upright, transparent conscience to all of us. Dear friends, good evening! This evening I have the chance to enter your homes in a different way than usual. If you allow me, I would like to have a conversation with you for a few moments https://t.co/1AUA9zHkY3 Today I would like to thank all new mothers who confront understandable fears. Thank you, as well, to those who affectionately and competently support them. The children born during this time of the #coronavirus are a sign of great hope. It would be good to stop a moment this Friday to think about the sorrow of Mary,the Sorrowful Mother,and to say \"thank you for accepting to be our Mother\".In the motherhood of Our Lady we see the Church's maternity which welcomes everyone.#HomilySantaMarta https://t.co/ELmkgexDEz There are some who are already thinking about after the epidemic, and all the problems that will arise regarding poverty, work, hunger. Let us #PrayTogether for all the people who are helping today, but who are also thinking about how to help all of us tomorrow. https://t.co/bQygXEkIRH Let us #PrayTogether for the difficulties that families are encountering in these days with children with #autism, and all persons with disabilities. May our Christian existence be like that of our father Abraham: aware of having been chosen, joyful in moving toward a promise, and faithful in fulfilling the covenant. #HomilySantaMarta https://t.co/Gklq5ZVl7d These days of pain and sadness are bringing many hidden problems in society to the surface. We ask St Teresa of Calcutta to reawaken in us the sense of nearness to so many persons who are hidden in normal life, such as the homeless. #PrayTogether What does it mean to have a \u201cpure\u201d heart? A purified heart is the result of a process that implies a liberation and a renunciation. The pure of heart is not born thus, it has lived an interior simplification, learning to renounce evil in itself. #Beatitudes #GeneralAudience \"If you remain in my Word, you will indeed be my disciples\" (Jn 8:31). The disciple is someone who is free because he or she remains in the Lord. To remain in the Lord means allowing oneself to be guided by the Holy Spirit. #HomilySantaMarta Let us #PrayTogether for all who work in the media, who work to communicate, to inform us, so that people are not so isolated, and to educate children. We pray for all those who are helping us bear this time of isolation. The Lord frees and heals the heart, if we call on Him with humility and trust. #Lent Jesus took our sins upon Himself to the point of making Himself sin. It's not easy to understand this; we will never fully comprehend it. We can only contemplate, pray, and give thanks. #HomilySantaMarta Let us #PrayTogether for those who are homeless. In this moment when everyone is supposed to be at home, may society help them and may the Church welcome them. https://t.co/3yKrrD0YC9 When we stand before the crucified Jesus, we see the depth of His love, which restores our dignity and sustains us. #Lent The Lord does justice for the innocent woman, forgives the sinner, condemns the corrupt ones, helps the hypocrites convert themselves. Each of us has our own story, our own sins. Let us look at the Lord who does justice, but who is also extremely merciful. #HomilySantaMarta #PrayTogether for the many people who are not succeeding in coping and remain in fear because of this pandemic. May the Lord help them to have the strength to cope for the good the entire community. https://t.co/zgeexapeL3 We are one human family. Let us bring all hostilities to a halt.  May our joint fight against the #COVID-19 pandemic bring everyone to recognize the great need to reinforce brotherly and sisterly bonds. #globalceasefire @antonioguterres @UN In the #GospelOfTheDay (John11:1-45), Jesus tells us: \"I am the resurrection and the life... have faith. Amid grief, continue to have faith, even when it seems that death has won. Let the Word of God restore life where there is death\u201d. Profoundly moved and troubled, He weeps (Jn 11:35). We ask the Lord for the grace of weeping today before all the people who are suffering the consequences of this pandemic. May today be for everyone like a Sunday of tears. #HomilySantaMarta I am thinking of the many people who are weeping.  We, too, accompany them from our hearts. It wouldn\u2019t do us any harm to weep a bit as our Lord wept for all of His people. #PrayTogether https://t.co/qljUTGiUfI During #Lent I invite you to halt in contemplation before the crucified Lord and repeat: \u201cJesus, you love me, transform me\u2026\u201d. https://t.co/sv2mce1gD4 It is not the time of your judgement, but of our judgement: a time to choose what matters and what passes away, a time to separate what is necessary from what is not. It is a time to get our lives back on track with regard to you, Lord, and to others. https://t.co/XYMR9WCLxX The people of God have a sense of knowing where the Spirit is, of knowing the paths of salvation. The people of God follow Jesus. They can't explain why, but they follow Him. And they never tire. #HomilySantaMarta In these days we are beginning to see other consequences of the pandemic. One is hunger.  We're beginning to see the aftermath. Let us #PrayTogether for the families who find themselves in need and are already facing hunger due to the pandemic. https://t.co/uFydbByThA But you, Lord, will not leave us at the mercy of the storm.  Tell us again: \u201cDo not be afraid\u201d (Mt 28:5).  And we, together with Peter, \u201ccast all our anxieties onto you, for you care about us\u201d (cf. 1 Pet 5:7). https://t.co/0jL43izNVh From this colonnade that embraces Rome and the whole world, may God\u2019s blessing come down upon you as a consoling embrace. https://t.co/PXPm7MTRBC Statio Orbis #PrayTogether https://t.co/XPYdKmhbHg Let us ask the Lord for the grace to fight against the evil spirit, to dialogue when we need to dialogue but, in the face of the spirit of fury, to have the courage to remain silent. #HomilySantaMarta https://t.co/yzH3jrHRo6 Let us #PrayTogether for the many people who are concerned for others - families that don't have enough to eat, elderly people who are alone, the sick in hospital - and who pray and seek to help them. We thank the Lord for stirring these sentiments in the hearts of the faithful. If you find it hard to pray, don\u2019t give up. Be still; make space for God to come in; let Him look at you, and He will fill you with His peace. #Lent In the context of the pandemic that threatens human life and the global economy, today we reiterate the teaching of #EvangeliumVitae to transmit the culture of life to future generations: an attitude of solidarity, care, and welcome. #GeneralAudience With her \"yes\" given to the Angel, the Virgin welcomed the Word made flesh and accepted to become the mother of the Son of God. So, in Mary, the encounter between God and man becomes reality. #GeneralAudience #PrayTogether https://t.co/ZWEVbEW9bs Let us stay united. I invite all Christians to direct their voices together toward Heaven, reciting the Our Father tomorrow, 25 March, at noon. #PrayTogether #PrayForTheWorld https://t.co/IsZqgssUVE The #GospelOfTheDay (Jn 5:1-16) tells of a paralytic ailing from pessimism, sadness, tepidity: a poisonous fog surrounding the soul that doesn\u2019t allow it to live. Then there is the symbol of our new life: the water that Jesus used to regenerate us in Baptism. #HomilySantaMarta In these days a number of doctors and priests have died. Many nurses were infected because they were serving the sick. I thank God for the example of heroism they give us in caring for the sick. Let us #PrayTogether for them and their families. Today Jesus speaks those same words to you: \u201cTake heart, I am here with you, allow me to enter and your life will change!\u201d #Lent The first requirement for prayer is faith, the second is perseverance, and the third is courage. In these days when we need to pray more, let us ask ourselves if we pray like this. The Lord never deludes! He makes us wait, but He never deludes. #HomilySantaMarta Let us pray today for those persons who are beginning to experience economic problems due to the pandemic, because they cannot work. All of this affects the family. #PrayTogether https://t.co/EHnyqJsDwK We want to respond to the virus pandemic with the universality of prayer, compassion and tenderness. Let us stay united. I invite all Christians to direct their voices together toward Heaven, reciting the Our Father on Wednesday, 25 March, at noon. #PrayTogether The #GospelOfTheDay (Jn 9:1-41) teaches us that sin is like a dark veil covering our face and keeping us from seeing ourselves and the world clearly. The Lord's forgiveness removes this cloak of darkness and gives us new light. In Jesus' presence, the true sentiments of the heart come forth. Let us read the #GospelOfTheDay (Jn 9:1-41) to understand what happens when Jesus passes by. #HomilySantaMarta Let us pray for the many people who are dying alone, without being able to say goodbye to their loved ones. Let us pray also for the families who cannot accompany their loved ones on that journey. #PrayTogether https://t.co/UOLE91JkOw #Lent invites us to reflect on the meaning of life, sure in the knowledge that only in and with Christ will we find the answer to the mystery of suffering and death. We were not created for death, but for life in abundance: eternal life. The Lord forgives all our sins, but He needs me to show them to Him. The #GospelOfToday teaches us how to pray, how to draw near to the Lord: humbly, with our \"souls exposed\", without make-up, or dressing ourselves up with our own virtue. #HomilySantaMarta https://t.co/wcvkUT6xEY Today we remember the families who cannot leave their homes: may they know how to find a way of communicating well, and conquer the anguish of this moment together. Let us #PrayTogether for peace in families today during this crisis, and for creativity. The fire of God\u2019s love consumes the ashes of our sin. The embrace of the Father renews us from inside and purifies our heart. #Lent The God of tenderness will heal us of all life's wounds and of all the bad things we have done. Returning to God means returning to an embrace, the embrace of the Father. #HomilySantaMarta https://t.co/z9cBiOPQFq Let us #PrayTogether for doctors, hospital staff, and volunteers who are giving their own lives to save others. And for civil leaders, for those who have to make decisions at this time. All these people are the pillars defending us in this crisis. #PrayTogether, entrusting ourselves to the intercession of St. Joseph, who knew precariousness and bitterness. Though he worried about the future, he knew how to walk through the darkness of certain moments, always letting himself be guided by God's will without reservation. https://t.co/NXMt2LvWiq Dear Brothers and Sisters, this evening let us join together spiritually in the prayer of the Holy Rosary. May Mary, Health of the sick, and St Joseph, man of faith, intercede for us! #PrayTogether Faith advances with humble and practical steps. #Lent On this Feast of #StJoseph let us ask the Lord for the grace to live in the concreteness of everyday life and also in the 'concreteness' of the mystery. Entering into the mystery is not about dreaming; entering into the mystery means to adore.  https://t.co/CDnWVrssxj God's mercy is our liberation and our happiness. We need to forgive, because we ourselves need to be forgiven. #GeneralAudience #Beatitudes Our God is near and asks us to be near to one another. Perhaps right now we cannot draw near physically to others for fear of contagion, but we can reawaken in ourselves a habit of drawing near to others through prayer and mutual help. #HomilySantaMarta #PrayTogether for the deceased, those who have died because of the virus. Let us pray especially for healthcare providers who have given their life in service of the sick. https://t.co/WKdbrRm70X Let us allow ourselves to be loved by God, so that we can give love in return. Let us allow ourselves to stand up and walk towards Easter. #Lent The parable Jesus tells us (Mt 18:23-35) is very clear: asking forgiveness means forgiving. Both go together and cannot be separated. Forgiving is a condition for going to heaven. #HomilySantaMarta   https://t.co/MjAnIoR5hB #PrayTogether for the elderly who are suffering in a particular way at this moment from great interior solitude, many times with a lot of fear. They gave us wisdom, life, our story... May we be near them with our prayer. https://t.co/j4bEje48f9 \u201cRepent\u201d, in other words, \u201cChange your life\u201d (Mt 4:17), for a new way of living has begun. The time when you lived for yourself is over; now is the time for living with and for God, with and for others, with and for love. #Lent God always acts through the simple things: the simplicity of everyday work, the simplicity of prayer. But the worldly spirit moves us toward vanity, toward appearances that end in violence. #HomilySantaMarta https://t.co/DnYFTHEhid May the Lord help families discover new expressions of love in this situation. It's a beautiful opportunity to creatively rediscover affection in the family. #PrayTogether that relationships within the family might flourish always for the good. https://t.co/eUfIWBEBch Let us ask for the grace to cultivate a desire for Christ, source of living water, the only one who can satisfy the thirst for life and love which we bear in our hearts. #Angelus The #GospelOfTheDay (Jn 4:5-42) tells us about Jesus' encounter with a woman, with a sinner who had the courage to tell Him the truth. May the Lord grant us the grace of praying always in truth. #HomilySantaMarta #PrayTogether today for those who are working to guarantee public services: those working in pharmacies, supermarkets, transportation, police officers, and for all those working to allow social and civil life to go ahead. https://t.co/3U3BczE5Bd Even before we set out to seek Him, we know that the Lord is seeking us and comes to meet and call us. We set out joyfully, for we know He is waiting for us! #Lent Through the parable of the Prodigal Son (Lk 15:1-32) the Lord helps us understand the problem: living at home but not feeling at home, because there's no paternal or fraternal relationship. #HomilySantaMarta We pray today for families who need to manage a difficult situation, especially those families with a disabled person among them. Let us pray they do not lose their peace in this moment and that they succeed in moving forward with strength and joy. https://t.co/BxMeg6vRRm #Prayer is an expression of our need to respond to God\u2019s love, which always precedes and sustains us. Christians pray in the knowledge that, although unworthy, we are still loved. Today let us ask the Lord for the grace to not forget the gratuitous nature of revelation. God manifests Himself as a gift, He made a gift of Himself for us, and we must give it, helping others see it as a gift, not as our possession. #SantaMarta I would like to pray today for pastors who need to accompany the people of God during this crisis. May the Lord grant them the strength and the ability to choose the best ways to help. https://t.co/e1BxllW68L The journey of #Lent is one of charity towards the weakest. We ask the Lord today for the grace of not falling into indifference, the grace that all the information we have about human suffering might penetrate our hearts and move us to do something for others. #HomilySantaMarta https://t.co/cTqd3lNy9s We seek refuge under your protection, O Holy Mother of God. Do not despise our pleas \u2013 we who are put to the test \u2013 and deliver us from every danger, O glorious and blessed Virgin. https://t.co/Ubk6RummYP We are called to rediscover what truly matters, what we really need, what helps us to live well and, at the same time, to identify what is secondary and that which we can easily do without. #GeneralAudience #Beatitudes Vanity - the spirit of the world - is the path the devil offers to drive us from the Cross of Christ. Let us ask the Lord for the grace to discern the Lord's path, which is the Cross, from the world's path, which is vanity.  https://t.co/N58O94j5b2 The Lord tells us not only to carry out works of charity, to pray, and to fast, but also to do these without pretense, duplicity, and hypocrisy. #Lent Today the Lord calls all of us sinners to dialogue with Him: \"Don't be afraid.\" \"Though your sins be like scarlet, they may become white as snow\" (Is 1:18). #HomilySantaMarta https://t.co/B59R49myGG Let us pray together. During these days you can follow the Mass from Santa Marta live every morning at 7am (Rome time): https://t.co/onKrW1XScS Our Lenten prayer can take any number of different forms, but what truly matters in God\u2019s eyes is that it penetrates deep within us and chips away at our hardness of heart, in order to convert us to Him. #Lent When we recall that we have sinned and have a sense of shame, this touches God's heart, and He responds with mercy. Today let us ask for the grace of a sense of shame. #HomilySantaMarta https://t.co/7OzG4uq4P7 To follow the Santa Marta Mass live https://t.co/onKrW1XScS It is specifically women who welcome life within them. Women demonstrate that living does not consist in continually producing things, but in embracing things as they are. #InternationalWomensDay The wondrous event of the Transfiguration, recounted in the #GospelOfTheDay (Mt 17:1-9), opens us to a fuller understanding of the mystery of Christ, who must suffer, die and then rise again. In this favorable time of #Lent, may we listen to the voice of the Lord. The more we are fully engaged with His Word, the more we will experience the mercy He freely gives us. #Lent is the perfect time to allow ourselves to contemplate the pain of those who suffer without anyone to help them. It is the time to turn compassion into concrete acts of solidarity and care. I wish to express again my closeness to those who are ill with the #coronavirus and to healthcare workers who are caring for them, as well as to civil authorities and all those involved in assisting patients and in containing the spread of the virus. https://t.co/LQVe8abprK I ask you to remember me in your prayers and also the members of the Roman Curia, who this evening begin a week of Spiritual Exercises. The #GospelOfTheDay (Mt 4:1-11) shows how Jesus responds to the tempter who tries three times to ensnare Him. May His experience also help us to be vigilant in the face of temptation and not to surrender to any idol of this world. #Lent May we allow ourselves to be reconciled, in order to live as beloved children, as forgiven and healed sinners, as wayfarers with him at our side. #Lent #RareDiseaseDay offers us the opportunity to together care for our brothers and sisters who are ill, to integrate research, medical care, and social assistance so that they might enjoy equal opportunities and lead a full life. Dignity of the person, justice, subsidiarity and solidarity: this it the contribution of the Church\u2019s social teaching in our common pursuit of \u201calgor-ethics\u201d. The Call that has been signed today is an important step in this direction. #renAIssance https://t.co/jr8wntY1bK #Lent is great time to make space for the Word of God. It is time to turn off the TV and open the Bible. It is a time to pull ourselves away from cell phones and connect ourselves to the Gospel. We pray, fast, and perform the works of mercy in this time of grace, so that the Lord might find our hearts ready and fill them with the victory of His love. #Lent #Lent is a time of grace, a time for recognizing that our lowly #ashes are loved by God and for letting God gaze upon us with love, and in this way change our lives. We were put in this world to go from ashes to life. #Ashes remind us of the direction of our existence: a passage from dust to life. We are dust, earth, clay, but if we allow ourselves to be shaped by the hands of God, we become something wonderous. https://t.co/C0dilCH8OR The #ashes we receive on our foreheads remind us that, as God's children, we cannot spend our lives chasing after dust. We begin the #Lenten Season by receiving #ashes. We are dust in the universe. Yet we are dust loved by God. https://t.co/C0dilCYKdr Fasting means knowing how to renounce vanities that pass away and superfluous things, to get to what is essential. It means seeking the beauty of a simpler life. #Lent #GeneralAudience This year the Lord grants us, once again, a favourable time to prepare to celebrate with renewed hearts the great mystery of the death and resurrection of Jesus, the cornerstone of Christian life. #Lent https://t.co/sM29Xsch3l Worldliness is the enemy of God. There is only one path against the spirit of the world: humility. Serving others, choosing the last place, not climbing the ladder. #HomilySantaMarta I wish you may all learn to look at life from above, from the perspective of heaven, to see things with God's eyes, through the prism of the Gospel. \u201cWe implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God\u201d (2 Cor 5:20) https://t.co/sM29XrUGbN Let us pray to the Lord that he may move hearts and that all may overcome the logic of confrontation, hatred and revenge in order to rediscover themselves as brothers, children of one Father. #Bari2020 If we want to be disciples of Christ, this is the way: loved by God, we are called to love; forgiven, to forgive; saved freely, to seek no profit from the good we do. #Bari2020 This is the work the Lord entrusts for the Mediterranean: to restore broken relationships, to rebuild cities destroyed by violence, to make a garden flourish, to instill hope in who has lost it and to encourage those caught up in themselves not to fear their brothers or sisters. On the feast of the #ChairOfSaintPeter, we give thanks to God for the mission entrusted to the apostle Peter and his successors: to gather His people from among the nations and guide them in charity and truth along the path of salvation. We received life not to bury it, but to put it into play; not to keep it, but to give it. Whoever is with Jesus knows that the secret to possessing life is to give it. To follow Jesus we must take three steps: draw close to Him to know Him better, confess - with the strength of the Holy Spirit - that He is the Son of God, and accept the path of humility and humiliation that He chose for the redemption of humanity. #HomilySantaMarta The option for the poor and the abandoned motivates us to liberate them from material poverty and to defend their rights, but also to invite them to friendship with the Lord, who loves them and has given them  immense dignity. #SocialJusticeDay \"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.\" The \"earth\" to conquer is the salvation of our brother and sister. There is no earth better than someone's heart, no land more beautiful to gain than peace renewed with a brother or sister. This is the earth to inherit. \"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth\" (Mt 5:5). Meekness can win over hearts, save friendships, and much more, because people get angry then they calm down. They rethink the issue before retracing their steps, and relationships can be rebuilt. #Beatitudes Every one of us has something that has hardened within our heart. The medicine to combat hardheartedness is memory: recalling the blessings of the Lord. This keeps our heart open and faithful. #HomilySantaMarta We alone cannot satisfy ourselves. We need to unmask our self-sufficiency, overcome our closures, go back to being small within, be simple and enthusiastic, filled with fervor for God and love for others. In #TodaysGospel, Jesus encourages us to move from a formal observance of the Law to a substantial observance, accepting the Law in our hearts. From the heart comes good and bad deeds. Our prayer must not be limited only to our needs, to our necessities: a prayer is truly Christian if it has a universal dimension too. Today it would do us good to think - as an act of gratitude to God - about those who accompany us on our journey through life: family members, friends, colleagues... The Lord wants us to be together as a people. Thank you, Lord, for never leaving us alone! #HomilySantaMarta Often we forget the Lord and deal with other gods: money, vanity, pride. Let us ask for the grace to understand when our heart begins to slide into worldliness. God's grace and love will stop us if we ask in prayer. #HomilySantaMarta The Amazonian peoples have a right to hear the Gospel: the proclamation of God who infinitely loves every man and woman, and has revealed this love fully in Jesus Christ, crucified for us and risen in our lives. #QueridaAmazonia I dream of Christian communities capable of generous commitment, incarnate in the Amazon region, and giving the Church new faces with Amazonian features. #QueridaAmazonia The Lord, who is the first to care for us, teaches us to care for our brothers and sisters and the environment which he daily gives us. This is the first ecology that that we need. #QueridaAmazonia https://t.co/LvZxR36SoQ I dream of an Amazon region that fights for the rights of the poor, the original peoples and the least of our brothers and sisters, where their voices can be heard and their dignity advanced. #QueridaAmazonia I am addressing the present Exhortation to the whole world. I am doing so to help awaken their affection and concern for that land which is also \u201cours\u201d. #QueridaAmazonia https://t.co/LvZxR3otNq \"Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted\" (Mt 5:4). Wise and blessed is the person who welcomes the pain that comes with love, because they will receive the consolation of the Holy Spirit,who is God's tenderness who forgives and corrects.#GeneralAudience#Beatitudes Jesus Christ offers His mercy to those who endure distress due to situations of frailty, suffering, and weakness. He invites everyone to share in His life in order to experience tender love. #WorldDayOfTheSick https://t.co/8d2uDYhbA0 I entrust to the Virgin Mary, Health of the Sick, all those who carry the burden of illness, along with their families and healthcare providers. I warmly assure everyone of my closeness in prayer. #WorldDayOfTheSick #OurLadyOfLourdes Faith grows when we invoke the Lord with confidence, bringing to Jesus who we are, with open hearts, without hiding our sufferings. Painful reports are still emerging from #Syria regarding the conditions facing women and children, as people are forced to flee the war. I renew my appeal to all parties involved to engage in dialogue and to respect Humanitarian Law in order to safeguard the lives of civilians. In the #GospelOfTheDay (Mt 5:13-16), Jesus calls His disciples to be salt and light in the world. The person who lives and spreads the grace of Christ is salt. The person who lets the Gospel shine with good deeds is light. Together against trafficking. Only together can we defeat this scourge and protect the victims. Prayer is the strength that sustains our commitment. #PrayAgainstTrafficking Saint Bakhita, patron saint of victims of trafficking, faced the pain of slavery and witnessed the freedom and joy of encountering the Lord. Let us pray that all may live this joy and break the chains of slavery. #PrayAgainstTrafficking Both John the Baptist, who is the greatest man born of woman, and the Son of God have chosen the path of humiliation. God shows this path to Christians so they can move forward. One cannot be humble without having suffered humiliation. #HomilySantaMarta #PrayAgainstTrafficking https://t.co/QWZLB6eUkN There is a poverty that we must accept, that of our own being, and a poverty that we must seek instead - a concrete one - from the things of this world, in order to be free and to be able to love. #GeneralAudience #Beatitudes The Document on Human Fraternity, signed one year ago, has written a new page in the dialogue between religions and people of good will. As brothers and sisters, we want to say \"no\" to violence, and together promote peace, life, and religious freedom. Brothers and sisters, in moments when we are far from God, it would do us good to hear this voice in our heart: \"My son, my daughter, what are you doing? Please, don't kill yourself. I died for you.\"  #HomilySantaMarta Loneliness is not overcome by closing in on ourselves, but by crying out to the Lord, for the Lord hears the cry of those who find themselves alone. The #GospeloftheDay (Lk 2:22-40), for the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord, shows us the amazement of Mary, Joseph, Simeon and Anne at what was happening before their eyes. The ability to be amazed makes our encounter with the Lord fruitful. Today we celebrate the #WorldDayforConsecratedLife. Let us pray for consecrated men and women who dedicate themselves to God and to their brothers and sisters through daily service: may they be ever faithful witnesses of Christ\u2019s love. https://t.co/W7o8QHfIFW Whoever keeps their gaze fixed on Jesus learns to live in order to serve. They do not wait for others to start, but set out to seek their neighbor. #ConsecratedLife May the Lord give us the grace to send us a prophet always - be they a friend, our confessor, our child, our mother - who warns us when we are slipping into a feeling that everything seems legitimate because we have lost our sense of sin. #HomilySantaMarta May the holiness of Saint #JohnBosco, who we remember today as a father and teacher to youth, be a guide, especially to you dear young people, in achieving your future projects, as you welcome the plan that God has for each of us. \"The measure with which you measure will be measured out to you.\" (Mk 4:24). Let us ask the Lord for the grace to not fear the cross, let us ask for the capacity to feel humiliated, because this is the path He has chosen for us to be saved. #HomilySantaMarta The Beatitudes are the \"identity card\" of a Christian. They are not about the joy that passes, but about happiness that knows how to live side by side with suffering. #GeneralAudience The Gospel will not go forward with boring, bitter evangelizers. No. It will only go forward with joyful evangelizers, full of life. #HomilySantaMarta If we lose our memory, we destroy our future. May the anniversary of the Holocaust, the unspeakable cruelty that humanity learned of 75 years ago, serve as a summons to pause, to be still and to remember. We need to do this, lest we become indifferent. #DayofMemory God\u2019s Word consoles and encourages us, it challenges us, frees us from the bondage of our selfishness and summons us to conversion; because it has the power to change our lives and to lead us out of darkness into the light. #SundayoftheWordofGod Let us make room for the Word of God!  Each day, let us read a verse or two of the Bible.  We will discover that God is close to us, that He dispels our darkness and, with great love, leads our lives into deep waters. #SundayoftheWordofGod We need God\u2019s Word: so that we can hear, amid the thousands of other words in our daily lives, that one Word that speaks to us not about things, but about life. #SundayoftheWordofGod\nhttps://t.co/jQqOkpPvg8 The Lord gives you his Word, so that you can receive it like a love letter he has written to you, to help you realize that he is at your side. #SundayoftheWordofGod From this Week of Prayer for #ChristianUnity we want to learn to be more hospitable, in the first place among ourselves as Christians, and among our brothers and sisters of different confessions. Hospitality belongs to the tradition of Christian communities and families. The Bible is the great love story between God and humanity. At its centre stands Jesus, whose own story brings to fulfilment both God\u2019s love for us and our love for God. Envy and jealousy are seeds that generate war. Let us ask for the grace to have a transparent heart, like that of David, a transparent heart that seeks justice and peace. #SantaMarta This year I want to dedicate World Communications Day to the theme of storytelling. In order not to get lost, we must make the truth of good stories our own. Stories that build up and help us find our roots and the strength to move forward together. https://t.co/sGHsqR8aeR Ecumenical hospitality requires a willingness to listen to other Christians, paying attention to their personal stories of faith and to the history of their community. Working together to practice hospitality, especially towards those whose lives are most vulnerable, will make us better human beings, better disciples, and a more united Christian people. #General Audience This year, the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity is dedicated to the theme of hospitality. #GeneralAudience Through Baptism, we Christians are all anointed by the election of the Lord, and this is a pure gift. Today let us ask the Holy Spirit to be able to preserve this gift with faithfulness. This is Christian holiness. #HomilySantaMarta Being Christian does not mean defending yourself with an ideology in order to move forward. To be Christian is to be free, because we have confidence, because we are docile to the Word of the Lord. #HomilySantaMarta Let us pause at #GospelofToday (John 1,29-34), perhaps even contemplating an icon of Christ, Son of God made lamb, to free us from evil. Yes, we are still poor sinners but not slaves, no, but children, children of God! Whoever has faith feels a great need for God and, in our own smallness, we surrender ourselves, trusting fully in Him. Jesus looks at the paralytic and focuses on what is essential: \"Your sins are forgiven\". Physical health is a gift that we must preserve but the Lord teaches us that we must also preserve the health of the heart, spiritual health. #HomilySantaMarta The Lord has so much compassion, He involves Himself in our problems. Let us often repeat this simple prayer: Lord, I am a sinner, have mercy on me, have compassion for me. #HomilySantaMarta May the Holy Spirit revive in each of us the call to be courageous and joyful evangelizers. #GeneralAudience Jesus had authority because there was consistency in what he taught and what he did, in how he lived. Authority is seen in this: consistency and witness. #HomilySantaMarta In the Christian life, it is not enough to be knowledgeable: unless we step out of ourselves, unless we worship, we cannot not know God. Christian life is a love story with God. On the Feast of the #BaptismoftheLord, we rediscover our Baptism. Just as Jesus is the Father\u2019s beloved Son, we too, reborn by water and the Holy Spirit, know that we are beloved children of God, brothers and sisters among many other brothers and sisters. In worship, we make it possible for the Lord to transform us by His love, to kindle light amid our darkness, to grant us strength in weakness and courage amid trials. Worship means going to Jesus without a list of petitions, but with one request alone: to abide with Him.  In worship, we allow Jesus to heal and change us. Worship means bending low before the Most High and to discover in His presence that life\u2019s greatness does not consist in having, but in loving. In worship, we learn to reject what should not be worshiped: the god of money, the god of consumerism, the god of pleasure, the god of success, the god of self. Hope is not utopian and peace is a good that can always be attained. https://t.co/RQSL5qc1r8 If we have no peace in our hearts, how can we think there will be peace in the world?  Let's try to remain in the Lord, and the way to do so is to love, and to love in little things. #HomilySantaMarta Worship means bringing our lives to the Lord, and allowing Him enter into them. It means letting His consolation come down to earth, and letting ourselves be pervaded by His tender love. Worship involves making an exodus from the greatest form of bondage: slavery to oneself. Worship means putting the Lord at the centre, not ourselves. So many people live without knowing what goes on in their hearts. We ask for the grace to remain in the Lord and to distinguish the Spirit of God from the spirit of the world, so that our heart may be the meeting point between God and us. #HomilySantaMarta I address a special thought to the brothers of the Eastern Churches, Catholic and Orthodox, who today celebrate the Lord's Christmas. To all I wish the light and peace of Christ the Saviour. In worshiping, we too will discover, like the Magi, the meaning of our journey. And like the Magi, we too will experience \u201ca great joy\u201d (Mt 2:10). Worship means concentrating on what is essential: ridding ourselves of useless things and addictions that anesthetize the heart and confound the mind. The #GospelOfTheDay (Mt 2:1-12) teaches us that, when we do not worship God, we end up worshiping ourselves. This is a grave risk: we use God instead of serving Him. This is the meaning of Christmas. If the Lord continues to come among us and give us the gift of His Word, it is so that each of us can respond to this call: to become saints in love. #Angelus We must believe that others need peace just as much as we do. Peace will not be obtained unless it is hoped for. Let us ask the Lord for the gift of peace! Salvation is in the name of Jesus. We must testify to this: He is the only Saviour. \u201cCome to me, all you who labour and are burdened, and I will give you rest\u201d (Mt 11:28). Message for the XXVIII World Day of the Sick https://t.co/8d2uDXZAbq https://t.co/MSxotMPlTi Let us ask for the grace to live this year with the desire to take others to heart and to care for them. Jesus, newly born, was mirrored in the face of His mother. From her, He received His first caresses; with her, He exchanged the first smiles. With her began the revolution of tenderness. The Church, looking at the Baby Jesus, is called to continue that revolution. May Mary, Mother of the Prince of Peace and Mother of all the peoples of the earth, accompany and sustain us at every step of our journey of reconciliation. https://t.co/xlB9PkSqP5 Today we invoke the Mother of God, who gathers us together as a people of believers. O Mother, give birth to hope within us and bring us unity. Woman of salvation, to you we entrust this year. Keep it in your heart. https://t.co/Fx9Tn14DuB In the womb of a woman, God and mankind are united, never to be separated again. In God, there will forever be our humanity and Mary will forever be the Mother of God. Let us begin the year in the sign of Our Lady, the woman who wove the humanity of God. The rebirth of humanity began with woman. If we want to weave humanity into the webs of our day, we must begin again with woman. Let us give thanks to God for His grace, which has sustained us in this past year, and with joy let us raise a song of praise to Him. https://t.co/8nPzsaSkIn It is beautiful to stand before the nativity scene, and there to entrust our lives to the Lord, to speak to Him about the people and situations we care about, to take stock with Him of the year that is ending, to share our expectations and concerns. #Nativityscene In its genuine simplicity, the nativity scene reminds us it is not the quantity of things that counts in life, but the quality of relationships. Drawing our gaze to God, who is poor in possessions and rich in love, it recalls us to what is essential. #Nativityscene Today, let us entrust to the Holy Family all the world\u2019s families, especially those tried by suffering or by discomfort, and let us invoke divine protection on them. Bethlehem means \"house of bread.\" The nativity scene we set up at home reminds us that Jesus is the bread of life: He is the one who nourishes our love, He is the one who gives our families the strength to go on and to forgive us. #Nativityscene The nativity scene reminds us how important it is to stop and contemplate. Because only when we recollect ourselves can we embrace what counts in life. Only if we leave the noise of the world outside can we open ourselves to listening to God, who speaks in silence. #Nativityscene Today we celebrate the feast of St Stephen, the first martyr. This young servant of the Gospel, filled with the Holy Spirit, knew how to speak about Jesus in word, and above all with his life. May Emmanuel bring light to all the suffering members of our human family.May He soften our often stony and self-centred hearts,and make them channels of His love.On this joyful day,may He bring His tenderness to all and brighten the darkness of this world.https://t.co/3QmmsbfoiR To listen to the Urbi et Orbi https://t.co/DO7vO1kEeT Today is the right day to draw near to the tabernacle, the cr\u00e8che, the manger, and to say thank you. Let us receive the gift that is Jesus, in order then to become gift like Jesus. To become gift is to give meaning to life. https://t.co/JETyIn5xNm Dear brother, dear sister, if your hands seem empty, if you think your heart is poor in love, this night is for you. The grace of God has appeared to shine forth in your life. Accept it and the light of Christmas will shine forth in you. Tonight, in the beauty of God's love, we also discover our own beauty, for we are beloved of God. In His eyes we are beautiful: not for what we do but for what we are. https://t.co/5Xeu4VXUP3 Tonight the love of God has been revealed to us. In Jesus, the Most High made Himself small, so that we might love Him. In Jesus, God made Himself a Child, so that we might embrace Him. I hope that setting up a nativity scene may be an opportunity for you to invite Jesus into your life. Because if He inhabits it, life is reborn. And it really is Christmas. #Nativityscene The nativity scene is like a living Gospel: it brings the Gospel into homes, schools, workplaces and meeting spaces, hospitals and nursing homes, prisons and town squares. #Nativityscene The nativity scene reminds us that God did not remain invisible in heaven, but came down to earth and became man. To set up a nativity scene is to celebrate the closeness of God, to rediscover that God is real, concrete; He is humble Love that came down to us. #Nativityscene In three days\u2019 time it will be #Christmas and my thoughts go especially to families, who are reunited in these festive days. May Holy Christmas be a fraternal time for everyone, one of growth in the faith and of actions of solidarity toward those who are in need. The Gospel of the Day (Mt 1, 18-24) guides us towards Christmas through Joseph\u2019s experience. His example helps us to listen to the coming Jesus, who asks us to include Him in our plans and in our choices. #GospelOfToday We need always to let ourselves be renewed by the smile of the Baby Jesus. Let His disarming goodness purify us from the waste that often encrusts our hearts. Jesus is the smile of God. He came to reveal to us the love and goodness of our heavenly Father. We need God's smile to strip us of our false certainties, and to bring us back to enjoying simplicity and gratuitousness. Trust in dialogue between individuals and between nations, in multilateralism, in the role of the international organizations, and in diplomacy as an instrument for appreciation and understanding, is indispensable for the building of a peaceful world. https://t.co/fyonLUPsiA Let us give thanks for all the good there is in the world, for the many people who dedicate themselves freely, for those who spend their lives in service, to build a more humane and just society. We know: alone we cannot save ourselves. @antonioguterres https://t.co/bOoWk1k2z1 I decided to display this life jacket,\"crucified\",to remind everyone of the essential commitment to save every human life, because the life of every person is precious in the eyes of God. The Lord will hold us to account for this at the moment of judgment. https://t.co/liDMTq73cU https://t.co/0qFoUOpKwi In these days before #Christmas we praise the Lord for the gratuitousness of salvation, for the gratuitousness of life, for everything he gives us for free. Everything is grace. #HomilySantaMarta I thank those people everywhere who have sent me their congratulations and good wishes for my fiftieth ordination anniversary and for my birthday. I thank you in a particular way for the gift of your prayers. Our response to the challenges posed by contemporary migration can be summed up in four verbs: welcome, protect, promote and integrate.  If we put them into practice, we will help build the city of God and man. #InternationalMigrantsDay https://t.co/L2psLIrBoC Every conversion comes from a previous experience of mercy, from God\u2019s tenderness that captures the heart. There are two attitudes typical of lukewarm Christians: putting God in a corner - either you do this for me or I won't go to Church anymore - and washing our hands of those in need. Let us get rid of these attitudes to make space for the Lord who is coming. #HomilySantaMarta May the Virgin Mary help us so that, as we approach #Christmas, we do not allow ourselves to be distracted by external things, but make room in our hearts for the One who has already come and wants to come again to heal our illnesses and to give us his joy. Faith gives us the ability to look with hope at the events of life, and helps us to accept even defeats and sufferings, in the knowledge that evil never has the last word. Thank you for accompanying me on this anniversary. I continue asking for the support of your prayer. The time before Christmas calls us to ask ourselves: What is the great desire of my heart? It is God Himself who puts this \u201cthirst\u201d in our hearts. And He comes to meet us by this route,wherever there is hunger and thirst for peace, hunger and thirst for justice, freedom and love. When we learn to live in forgiveness, we grow in our capacity to become men and women of #peace. https://t.co/xlB9PkAPqv Today in the world many Christians are persecuted and give their lives for their faith. Martyrdom is the breath of the life of a Christian, of a Christian community. There will always be martyrs among us: this is the sign that we are following the way of Jesus. #GeneralAudience Let us ask the Lord, in this time of Advent, to revive in us faith in Christ who comes to save us, to help us be always faithful to our vocation as missionary disciples. #GeneralAudience \"Like a shepherd He feeds His flock, in His arms He gathers the lambs, carrying them in his bosom, leading the ewes with care\" (Is 40:11), so the Lord comforts us. #HomilySantaMarta May Our Lady of #Loreto help us to walk the path of peace and fraternity based on acceptance and forgiveness, respect for others, and on love; may she grant families the blessing of life; and may she bring help and comfort to those in need. #LauretanJubilee The human person is always sacred and inviolable, in any situation and at any stage of his or her development. If this conviction falls, there is no solid and permanent foundation for the defense of #HumanRights. Corruption undermines the dignity of the person and shatters all good and beautiful ideals.All of society is called upon to make a concrete commitment to combat the cancer of corruption which, with the illusion of quick and easy profits, in reality impoverishes everyone.#IACD2019 May the feast of our Mother #MaryImmaculate help us to make our whole life a \"yes\" to God, a \"yes\" composed of adoration of Him and of daily gestures of love and service. The true worship of God is always expressed in love of one\u2019s neighbour. Prayer is the door of faith; prayer is medicine for the heart. https://t.co/SRUzq8AQCX Today the Church praises stability. \u201cTrust in the Lord forever, because the Lord is an eternal Rock\u201d (Isa 26:4). Those who trust in the Lord will always be safe, because their foundations are sunk into the Rock. #HomilySantaMarta Let us pray for all the pastors of the Church, that they might guide the flock entrusted to them with the same firmness and tenderness of the Good Shepherd. #GeneralAudience Today the Church praises smallness. God's works begin by sprouting from a seed, from little things. Jesus speaks about this smallness of the Kingdom: the small heart, humble, that is open to the revelation of the Lord. #HomilySantaMarta Today we renew our commitment so that every disabled person may share their gifts with the community to which they belong and in which they take part. #IDPD The closeness to the Lord invites our heart to approach our brothers and sisters with love, to show compassion towards everyone. With this Letter, I wish to encourage the beautiful family tradition of preparing the nativity scene in the days before Christmas, but also the custom of setting it up in the workplace, in schools, hospitals, prisons and town squares. https://t.co/iP5brT7CMh The word #Advent means coming. The Lord is coming. This is the root of our hope: the certainty that God's consolation comes to us amidst the troubles of the world. Not a consolation of words, but of His presence among us. In the #GospelOfTheDay, Jesus exhorts us to be ready for His coming: \"Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming\" (Mt 24:42). To watch means to have your heart ready to give and to serve, to be attentive to our neighbour in difficulty. The Church exists to keep alive in people\u2019s heart the memory that God loves them. It exists to tell everyone, even those furthest away: \u201cGod doesn\u2019t forget you, He cares about you\u201d. How important it is to learn to be a friendly and outstretched hand! Try to grow in friendship even with those who think differently than you, so that solidarity might growamong you and become the best weapon to change the course of history. My apostolic journey to Thailand and Japan was a gift for which I am so grateful to the Lord. This visit increased my closeness and affection for these peoples: may God bless them with prosperity and peace in abundance. #GeneralAudience \u79c1\u306e\u8a2a\u65e5\u306b\u969b\u3057\u3001\u7686\u69d8\u304c\u79c1\u3092\u771f\u5fc3\u3092\u8fbc\u3081\u3066\u3042\u305f\u305f\u304b\u304f\u304a\u8fce\u3048\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u306b\u5bfe\u3057\u3001\u79c1\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u3059\u3079\u3066\u306e\u7686\u69d8\u306b\u6df1\u304f\u611f\u8b1d\u7533\u3057\u4e0a\u3052\u307e\u3059\u3002\u304a\u7948\u308a\u306e\u5185\u306b\u7686\u69d8\u306e\u3053\u3068\u3092\u5fc3\u306b\u7559\u3081\u3066\u304a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002 I thank the entire Japanese people for the kind reception and welcome accorded me during my Apostolic Visit. I will keep all of you in my prayers. The theme of my visit is \u201cProtect All Life\u201d, in the recognition of its inviolable dignity and the importance of showing solidarity and support to our brothers and sisters in any kind of need. #ApostolicJourney The world needs you. Never forget that! The Lord needs you, so that you can encourage all those people around us who are looking for a helping hand to lift them up. #ApostolicJourney In the ongoing work of recovery and rebuilding after the disasters, many hands must join together and many hearts unite as one. In this way, those who are suffering will be supported and know that they have not been forgotten. #ApostolicJourney To remember, to journey together, to protect.  These are three moral imperatives that here in #Hiroshima assume even more powerful and universal significance, and can open a true path to peace. https://t.co/FZkYnxjV40 The use of atomic energy for purposes of war is immoral, just as the possession of atomic weapons is immoral, as I said two years ago. We will be judged on this. #EndNuclearWeapons #Hiroshima #ApostolicJourney Peace is no more than an empty word unless it is founded on truth, built up in justice, animated and perfected by charity, and attained in freedom. #Hiroshima #ApostolicJourney The kingdom of heaven is our common goal, a goal that cannot be only about tomorrow.  We have to implore it and begin to experience it today. #GospelOfToday #ApostolicJourney We are united with those Christians throughout the world who, in our own day, suffer martyrdom for the faith. They are the martyrs of the twenty-first century and their witness summons us to set out with courage on the path of the Beatitudes. #ApostolicJourney #NishizakaHill In a world where millions of children and families live in inhumane conditions, the money that is squandered and the fortunes made through the manufacture, maintenance and sale of ever more destructive weapons, are an affront crying out to heaven. I ask you to join in praying each day for the conversion of hearts and for the triumph of a culture of life, reconciliation and fraternity. #EndNuclearWeapons #Nagasaki #ApostolicJourney Try to create spaces in which the culture of efficiency, performance and success can become open to a culture of generous and selfless love, capable of offering to everyone, and not only to those who have \u201cmade it\u201d, the possibility of a happy and successful life.#ApostolicJourney Protecting all life and proclaiming the Gospel are not separate or opposed; rather each appeals to, and requires, the other. #ProtectAllLife #ApostolicJourney I thank all those who made my visit to Thailand possible, and those who accompanied me with their prayer. I invoke abundant divine blessings on this beloved Nation, and I ask the Lord to guide it on the paths of wisdom, justice and peace. #ApostolicJourney Let us go out to meet Christ the Lord for he is coming! Do not be afraid of the future or allow yourselves to be intimidated. Rather know that the Lord is waiting for you there in order to prepare and celebrate the banquet of his kingdom. #ApostolicJourney https://t.co/R83xVsrCUG The secret to a happy heart is the security we find when we are anchored, rooted in Jesus: in his life, in his words, in his death and resurrection. #ApostolicJourney A missionary Church knows that its best message is its readiness to be transformed by the word of life, making service its hallmark. #ApostolicJourney Without prayer, our life and mission loses all its meaning, strength and fervor. #ApostolicJourney The Gospel is full of questions that attempt to unsettle, to stir and to invite the disciples to set out, to discover the truth that is capable of giving and generating life. #ApostolicJourney https://t.co/9Hs6ZRfwo4 When Christians and Buddhists have the opportunity to appreciate and esteem one another, in spite of our differences, we offer the world a word of hope that can encourage and support those who are wounded by division. #ApostolicJourney I leave today on my 32nd #ApostolicJourney. Dear friends in Thailand and Japan, before we meet, let us pray together that these days may be rich in grace and joy. God will not be the only one who welcomes us into Heaven. There will also be those with whom we have shared all the Lord has placed in our hands, after administering it well. How beautiful it would be if the poor could occupy in our hearts the place they have in the heart of God! #WorldayofthePoor The poor facilitate our access to Heaven. Even now, they are the treasure of the Church.  They reveal to us the riches that never grow old, that unite heaven and earth, for which life is truly worth living: the riches of love. #WorldayofthePoor https://t.co/egV98m0XBq In #GospelOfToday (Luke 21, 5-19) as an antidote to haste, Jesus proposes perseverance to each of us: \u201cBy your perseverance you will secure your lives\u201d. Let us pray for the grace to be able to listen to the cry of the poor: it is the cry of hope of the Church. God is merciful towards those who admit their need. God has entrusted us with His greatest gifts: our life, the lives of others, and so many different gifts for each person. He invites us to make these talents bear fruit with audacity and creativity. My thoughts go out to beloved Burkina Faso, where an attack has killed many people. I entrust to the Lord the victims and all those who suffer as a result of such tragedies. I appeal to the Authorities to promote inter-religious dialogue and harmony. Let us ask the Lord to pour His Spirit upon Christian couples and families, so that, as they generously open their doors to Christ and to their brothers and sisters, they may bear authentic witness to a life of faith, hope and charity. #GeneralAudience I am close to Armenian Catholics of Qamishli, in Syria, as they gather for the funeral of their parish priest, Father Hovsep Bedoyan, who was killed yesterday together with his father. I pray for them, their families, and for all Christians in Syria. We ask the Lord to increase our faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in our hearts: He who assumed our human nature, who became Man in order to fight with our flesh and to conquer in our flesh. #HomilySantaMarta We must put an end to the culture of waste, we who pray to the Lord to give us our daily bread. Food waste contributes to hunger and to climate change. https://t.co/eDghYSllVZ Listening to the simple and clear words of Jesus about life after death in the #GospelOfToday (Lk 20:27-38) gives great consolation and hope. We need this a lot in our time, so rich in knowledge about the universe but so poor in wisdom about eternal life. Jesus, true God and true man, destroyed death, is risen and wants to rise again in the hearts of all. No one, no matter how wounded by evil, is condemned to be separated from God on this earth forever. Prayer always arouses feelings of fraternity, it breaks down barriers, crosses borders, creates invisible but real and effective bridges, and opens horizons of hope. Faith calls for a journey, a \u201cgoing out\u201d. Purification takes places on the journey of life, a journey that is often uphill, because it leads upwards. Christian hope, nourished by the light of Christ, makes the resurrection and life shine even in the world\u2019s darkest nights. Dear friends, in this month of November, we are invited to pray for the dead. Let us entrust our family members, friends and acquaintances to God, especially in the Eucharist, feeling them close to us in the spiritual company of the Church. #GeneralAudience https://t.co/Ba8bVNMMCa We face this choice many times in our lives: do I accept the Lord's invitation or close myself off in my interests, in my smallness? Let us ask the Lord for the grace always to accept the invitation to His feast, which is free. #SantaMarta Holiness is the fruit of God's grace and of our free response to it. Holiness is a gift and a call. The #GospelOfTheDay (Lk 19:1-10) shows us that the merciful gaze of the Lord reaches us before we even realize that we need it to be saved. Today we remember those who have walked before us, in the hope of meeting them, of reaching the place where we'll find the love that created us and awaits us: the love of the Father. #AllSoulsDay The memory of the Saints leads us to raise our eyes to Heaven: not to forget the realities of the earth, but to face them with more courage and hope. #AllSaintsDay The love of God is expressed in the tender tears of Jesus. As He cried for Jerusalem, so He cries for each of us when we don't allow ourselves to be loved. This is God's tender love. #SantaMarta The protagonist of the Church's mission, is the Holy Spirit, Who guides the path of evangelizers, showing them the way to follow. Let us ask the Holy Spirit for an open heart, sensitive to God and hospitable towards our brothers and sisters. #GeneralAudience #MissionaryOctober Hope is to live in anticipation of meeting the Lord. It's like throwing an anchor to the other shore and clinging to the rope. #SantaMarta In these last days of October, I invite you to pray the #HolyRosary for the mission of the Church today, especially for men and women missionaries who encounter the greatest difficulties. #MissionaryOctober In the #GospelOfToday, looking at the tax collector, we rediscover where to start: from the conviction that we, all of us, are in need of salvation. #AmazonSynod https://t.co/e3FreQjUyy In this #AmazonSynod we felt the need to place ourselves before the Lord, to put Him back at the centre, both personally and as the Church. Because we can only proclaim what we live. Let us ask the Lord for the light to really understand what is happening within us. #SantaMarta As we celebrate the #ExtraordinaryMissionaryMonth, we ask the Holy Spirit to enable us to open the doors of the Gospel to all peoples and to be authentic witnesses of divine love. #GeneralAudience Let us thank the Lord for all the good done, in the world and in our hearts, through the words, actions and holiness of #JohnPaulII. Let us remember always his call to: \"Open the doors to Christ!\" #SaintOfTheDay During this missionary month, the Lord is also calling you: He is asking you to be a gift wherever you are, just as you are, with everyone around you. Courage! The Lord expects great things from you! #ExtraordinaryMissionaryMonth #MissionaryOctober Go and show love to everyone, because your life is a precious mission: it is not a burden to be borne, but a gift to offer. #ExtraordinaryMissionaryMonth #MissionaryOctober https://t.co/2hdbjOPe7J This is our mission: to show by our lives, and perhaps even by our words, that God loves everyone and never tires of anyone. #ExtraordinaryMissionaryMonth #MissionaryOctober In the midst of this missionary month, let us ask ourselves: what really counts in my life? To what peaks do I want to ascend? #ExtraordinaryMissionaryMonth #MissionaryOctober https://t.co/6kve0dDX5A I encourage you to bring the light of the Gospel to our contemporaries. May you be witnesses of freedom and mercy, allowing fraternity and dialogue to prevail over divisions. #ExtraordinaryMissionaryMonth #MissionaryOctober Dear young people, as you pray the #HolyRosary for unity and peace, consider that in one of the rosary beads I too am with you! @acn_int Saint Luke, you reveal the heart of Jesus and His mercy, help us to rediscover the joy of being Christians, witnesses of the goodness of the Lord. #SaintOfTheDay \"I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink\" (Mt 25,35). Today we ask for the grace of compassion and the capacity to share in the poverty of our brothers and sisters. #EndPoverty Let us work together so that every person can have access to adequate food, according to the will of God. #ZeroHunger https://t.co/3yy0PeCkX6 Today we ask for the grace to allow ourselves to be amazed by God's surprises, to not hinder His creativity, but to encourage hearts to encounter the Lord. #GeneralAudience How do we root out hypocrisy? There's a good medicine that can help us not be hypocrites: point the finger at ourselves and say to the Lord \"Look at the way I am, Lord!\", and say it with humility. #SantaMarta The Lord gives each of us a vocation, a challenge to discover the talents and abilities we possess and to put them at the service of others. The #GospelOfToday shows us  that the ultimate goal is the encounter with Jesus. He alone frees us from evil and heals our hearts.  Only an encounter with him can save, can make life full and beautiful. https://t.co/dkqYPEnUzt Today we give thanks to the Lord for our new #Saints. They walked by faith and now we invoke their intercession. Let us pray for our communities, that by giving witness to the joy of Christian life, they may see a flowering of the call to holiness. The Lord always reminds us how precious we are in His eyes, and He entrusts us with a mission. May the Holy Spirit, the builder of fraternity, give us the grace to walk beside one another. May He make us courageous as we experience unprecedented ways of sharing and of mission. Jonah is stubborn in his faith convictions, and the Lord is stubborn in His mercy. Because the Lord always wants to heal and to save, not to condemn. #SantaMarta I ask you to accompany this important ecclesial event with prayers, so that it may be experienced in fraternal communion and docility to the Holy Spirit, who always shows the ways for bearing witness to the Gospel. #SinodoAmazonico https://t.co/YLXA70PjiO So many of our brothers and sisters in Amazonia are bearing heavy crosses and awaiting the liberating consolation of the Gospel, the Church\u2019s caress of love. For them, and with them, let us journey together. #SinodoAmazonico https://t.co/EVmARSJQWx In the #GospelOfToday, Jesus shows us that the measure of faith is service. \"We are useless servants\" is an expression of humility and availability that does so much good for the Church. #Angelus The willingness of a Cardinal to shed his own blood, symbolized by the red colour of his clothing, is guaranteed when it is rooted in compassion, received from God, and given to his brothers and sisters. As we close the #SeasonOfCreation today, we entrust the #AmazonSynod to St. Francis of Assisi. The Word of God fills us with joy and this joy is our strength. We are joyful Christians because we have welcomed the Word of God in our hearts. This is the message for today, for all of us. #SantaMarta May the memorial of our #HolyGuardianAngels strengthen in us the certainty that we are not alone. May it sustain us in proclaiming and living Christ's Gospel for a world renewed in God's love. Through our small steps of love, God does great things. He accomplishes the salvation of the world. Let us entrust to St. Therese of the Child Jesus, our faithful friend, the #ExtraordinaryMissionaryMonth that begins today. #MissionaryOctober \nhttps://t.co/6kve0dDX5A #ExtraordinaryMissionaryMonth #MissionaryOctober https://t.co/m362IVSyIv May the Sunday of the Word of God help his people to grow in religious and intimate familiarity with the sacred Scriptures. #AperuitIllis \nhttps://t.co/f9KizpVtkL The sweetness of God\u2019s word leads us to share it with all those whom we encounter in this life and to proclaim the sure hope that it contains. #AperuitIllis https://t.co/f9KizpVtkL The elderly and the young, together. This is the sign that a people cherishes life, that there is a culture of hope: the care of the young and the elderly. #SantaMarta It's not just about migrants, it's about all of us, about the human family, called to build together a world more in accord with God's plan. #NotJustAboutMigrants @M_RSection\nhttps://t.co/L2psLIrBoC We need others in order to live and to share the love and trust that the Lord gives us. The true face of love is mercy. Practicing it, we become a disciple of Jesus and the heart of the Father shows itself. When we become \"spiritually lukewarm\", we become half-Christians, without substance. Instead, the Lord wants conversion, today. #SantaMarta Let us ask the Lord that, by contemplating the martyrs of yesterday and today, we may learn to live the Gospel faithfully every day. #GeneralAudience Let us learn to call people by their name, as the Lord does with us, and to give up using adjectives. We are called to be witnesses and messengers of God's mercy, to offer the world light where there is darkness, hope where despair reigns, salvation where sin abounds. In today's Gospel, Jesus assures us that we are always in time to right our wrongs by doing good. Whoever has caused tears, make someone happy; whoever has misappropriated, give to someone in need. #Angelus Peace entails a conversion of heart and soul. It is a challenge that demands to be taken up ever anew. #PeaceDay The Apostle Paul exhorts ministers to closeness: closeness to God, prayer, closeness of the bishop to his priests; closeness of priests to each other; closeness to the people of God. #SantaMarta If we bishops and priests appropriate the gift of God and turn it into a job, we lose the gaze of Jesus. Let us ask the Lord to help us take care of the gift of our ministry. #SantaMarta Every human project can first be approved and then end up shipwrecked. But everything that comes from above and bears the \u201csignature\u201d of God is destined to last. #GeneralAudience \"The Lord was moved with compassion\" (Luke 7:13). Our God is a God of compassion. Compassion is the weakness of God, but also His strength. #SantaMarta St Paul asks us to pray \"for all in authority\" (1 Tim 2:2). We must learn to do this, even for politicians with whom we disagree. Christians must pray for all people in government, that they may work for the common good. #SantaMarta God waits for us: He doesn't get tired, He doesn't lose heart. Because it is each one of us who is that child embraced again, that coin found again, that sheep caressed and put back on His shoulders (Luke 15:1-32). #Angelus Today the Church asks us to contemplate the glorious Cross of Our Lord. Though He was God, Christ humbled Himself by becoming a servant. This is the glory of the Cross of Jesus! If they want to grow in His friendship, Jesus\u2019 disciples, must not complain and look inward. They must act and commit themselves, certain that the Lord will support and accompany them. I wish to endorse a global event, to take place on 14 May 2020 on the theme Reinventing the Global Educational Alliance. https://t.co/rcVFp7iigp Today we celebrate the Feast of the Most Holy Name of Mary. I invite everyone to turn to Our Lady. Let her inspire you with a Christian outlook, so as to live like and imitate her Son Jesus ever more. Christ is the hope of the world: His Gospel is the most powerful leaven of brotherhood, freedom, justice and peace for all peoples. #GeneralAudience Thank you for your warm welcome. May God bless you all you. May His love and mercy continue to accompany and protect you! #ApostolicJourney What must one do to be a good Christian? The answer is simple: we have to do, each in our own way, what Jesus says in the Beatitudes. #ApostolicJourney #Mauritius Happy are you, happy is the Church of the poor and for the poor, for she lives imbued with the fragrance of her Lord, she lives joyfully proclaiming the Good News to the throw-aways of the earth, to those who are God's favorites. #ApostolicJourney #Madagascar Akamasoa, \"City of Friendship\", is the expression of the God\u2019s presence God who decided to live and remain always in the midst of His people. Seeing these radiant faces, I give thanks to the Lord who has heard the cry of the poor. #ApostolicJourney #Madagascar Let us turn in prayer to the Holy Virgin on this day when we remember her birth, the dawn of salvation for humanity. #Angelus Our life and our talents are the result of a gift woven between God and the many silent hands of persons whose names we will only know in Heaven. #ApostolicJourney #Madagascar The Lord is the first to trust in you, and He also invites you to trust in yourselves; He invites you to encourage one another, and join Him in writing the most beautiful page of your lives. #ApostolicJourney #Madagascar A sower of peace and hope knows how to wait, he trusts; he realizes the limitations of his sowing, but he never stops loving the field entrusted to his care. #ApostolicJourney #Madagascar Jesus proposes a first golden rule for everyone: \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\" (Lk 6:31); and he helps us to discover what is most important: to love us and help us. #ApostolicJourney #Mozambique Let\u2019s not forget that the names of our poorest brothers and sisters, written in heaven, have this inscription next to them: these are the blessed ones of my Father. #ApostolicJourney #Mozambique No one is more insignificant than a priest left to his own devices; therefore, our prayer is that of our Mother: I am a priest because the Lord has regarded my insignificance with kindness (cf. Lk 1:48). #ApostolicJourney #Mozambique Try to keep quiet a moment and let God love you. Try to silence all the inner voices, and rest for a second in His loving embrace. #ApostolicJourney #Mozambique The pursuit of lasting peace is a mission that involves everyone. It calls for strenuous, constant and unceasing effort, because peace is like a delicate flower trying to blossom on the stony ground of violence. #ApostolicJourney #Mozambique I invite you, each within your own heart, to pray for our brothers and sisters who have lost their lives or who are suffering because of the hurricane in the Bahamas I invite you all to join me in prayer, that God, the Father of all, may consolidate fraternal reconciliation throughout Africa, which is the only hope for solid and lasting peace. #ApostolicJourney #Mozambique #Madagascar #Mauritius The Holy Spirit, when we invite Him into our wounds, anoints our painful memories with the balm of hope, because the Spirit restores hope. May God, the lover of life, grant us the courage to do good without waiting for someone else to begin, or until it is too late.\nhttps://t.co/ugglgmzHtO Creation, a place of encounter with the Lord and one another, is \u201cGod\u2019s own social network\u201d, which inspires us to raise a song of cosmic praise to the Creator.\nhttps://t.co/ugglgmzHtO We are beloved creatures of God, who in His goodness calls us to love life and to live it in communion with the rest of creation.\nhttps://t.co/ugglgmRilm This is the season to reflect on our lifestyles and to undertake prophetic actions.\nhttps://t.co/ugglgmzHtO This is the season for letting our prayer be inspired anew by closeness to nature, which spontaneously leads us to give thanks to God the Creator.\nhttps://t.co/ugglgmRilm Now is the time to rediscover our vocation as children of God, brothers and sisters, and stewards of creation. In this #SeasonOfCreation, I invite everyone to dedicate themselves to prayer.\nhttps://t.co/ugglgmzHtO In today\u2019s Gospel, Jesus invites us to selfless generosity, to open the path towards a much greater joy: that of participating in God\u2019s own love. #Angelus https://t.co/TdCbOx8TLu In our daily relationship with Jesus, and in the strength of His forgiveness, we rediscover our roots. Saint John the Baptist who bore witness to the Messiah by dying for the truth, pray for us! We ask for the grace not to be lukewarm Christians, living on half measures, letting love grow cold. The light of God enlightens those who welcome it. Whoever draws near to God will not stumble, but strives ahead: beginning anew, trying again, rebuilding. In today's Gospel, Jesus explains how in Heaven there is no \"limited number\", but in order to get there, already in this life we must pass through the \"narrow gate\": loving God and our neighbour. And this is not easy! #Angelus May God who remembers us, God who heals our wounded memories by anointing them with hope, God who is near to lift us up from within, help us to build up the good and to console hearts. All of us have been created in the image and likeness of God and have the same dignity. Let us stop slavery! #IDRSTA May the Lord open our hearts to the needs of the poor, the defenseless, those who knock on our door to be recognized as a person. It takes more strength to repair than to build, to start anew than to begin, to be reconciled than to get along. This is the strength that God gives us. In the uncertainty that we feel both inside and out, the Lord gives us a certainty: He remembers us. Today we remember all the brave women who go out to meet their brothers and sisters in difficulty. Each of them is a sign of God's closeness and compassion. #WomenHumanitarians In today's Gospel, Jesus reveals to us His most ardent desire: to bring to the earth the fire of the Father's love: the fire that saves, that changes the world, starting from the change of each one's heart. #Angelus With God, the burdens of life rest not upon our shoulders alone: the Holy Spirit comes to give us strength, to encourage us, to bear our burdens. Let us ask Our Lady to protect and sustain us; that we may have a strong, joyful and merciful faith; that she may help us to be saints, to meet her one day in Paradise. Mary's journey to Heaven began with that \"yes\" pronounced at Nazareth. Every \u201cyes\u201d to God is a step towards Heaven, towards eternal life. Because the Lord wants us all with Himself, in His house! Let us ask for the grace to remember each day that we are not forgotten by God, and that we are His beloved children, unique and irreplaceable. Calling this to mind gives us the strength not to surrender before the adversities of life. Only when we experience God's forgiveness are we truly reborn. We start again from there, from forgiveness. It is there that we rediscover ourselves: in confessing our sins. Education with horizons open to transcendence helps young people to dream and to build a more beautiful world. #IYD2019 Today's Gospel invites us to abandon ourselves with simplicity and trust to God's will, and to keep \"the lamps alight\", so we can brighten the darkness of the night. #Angelus Basically, the Christian witness announces this alone: that Jesus is alive and that He is the secret of life. #StLawrenceMartyr Indigenous peoples, with their variety of languages, cultures, traditions, and ancestral knowledge, remind us that we are all responsible for the care of Creation, which God has entrusted to us. #IndigenousPeoplesDay In the midst of all those passing things in which we are so caught up, help us, Father, to seek what truly lasts: your presence and that of our brother or sister. The way of Jesus, which leads to peace, passes through forgiveness, for one evil never corrects another evil and no resentment is ever good for the heart. In the Transfiguration, Jesus shows us the glory of the Resurrection: a glimpse of heaven on earth. The Lord invites all of us to conquer resentment with love and forgiveness, and to live the Christian faith with consistency and courage. Thank you for the joy with which you have offered your lives. Thank you for all the times you welcomed those who have fallen, caring for their wounds and showing tenderness and compassion. #ToMyBrotherPriests On the feast of the saintly Cur\u00e9 d'Ars, I write to all of you who, carrying out your mission in service to God and His people, write the most beautiful pages of priestly life. #ToMyBrotherPriests\nhttps://t.co/xd2JkKyOD9 Holy Spirit, give us the joy of the resurrection, the perennial youth of the heart! The Lord does not perform wonders with those who believe themselves to be just, but with those who know they are in need and are willing to open their hearts to Him. https://t.co/RejBYUN7al As a young soldier, St Ignatius of Loyola, whom we remember today, thought of his own glory. But then he was attracted by the glory of God, which gave meaning to his life. Let us pray that the Lord will free the victims of human trafficking and help us to respond actively to the cry for help of so many of our brothers and sisters who are deprived of their dignity and freedom. #EndHumanTrafficking The Lord gives each of us a vocation, a challenge to discover the talents and abilities we possess and to put them at the service of others. In today's Gospel, Jesus invites us to experience prayer, putting us in direct communication with the Father. This is the novelty of Christian prayer! It is a dialogue between people who love one another, a dialogue based on trust. Jesus looks for witnesses who say to Him every day: \"Lord, you are my life\". Witness is born from the encounter with the living Jesus. #SaintMaryMagdalene, Apostle of Hope, pray for us! Today's Gospel reminds us that the wisdom of the heart lies in knowing how to combine contemplation and action. Let us ask for the grace to love and serve God, and our brothers and sisters, with the hands of Martha and the heart of Mary. Today, the Feast of #OurLadyofMountCarmel, we contemplate the Virgin who stands beside the Cross of Christ. That is also the place of the Church: close to Christ. In today's Gospel, Jesus proposes the Samaritan as a model. By loving his neighbor as himself, he demonstrates how to love God with one's whole heart, while at the same time expressing true religiosity and full humanity. Today we celebrate #SeaSunday, dedicated to seafarers and fishermen. I pray for them and their families, and I encourage every effort to protect and safeguard their human rights. Faith is a gift that keeps alive a profound and beautiful certainty: that we are God\u2019s beloved children. May God the Father welcome Vincent Lambert in His arms. Let us not build a civilization that discards persons those whose lives we no longer consider to be worthy of living: every life is valuable, always. We pray for the sick who are abandoned and left to die. A society is human if it protects life, every life, from its beginning to its natural end, without choosing who is worthy to live or who is not. Doctors should serve life, not take it away. \u201cThis is not just about migrants\u201d, in the twofold sense that migrants are first of all human persons, and that they are the symbol of all those rejected by today\u2019s globalized society. https://t.co/C3rLYrgCnB On this sixth anniversary of the visit to Lampedusa, my thoughts go out to those \u201cleast ones\u201d who daily cry out to the Lord, asking to be freed from the evils that afflict them. https://t.co/C3rLYqZ0Z1 In today's Gospel Jesus tells us of the real joy of his disciples: \"Rejoice because your names are written in heaven\" (Lk 10, 20), that is, in the heart of God the Father. We need people and institutions that defend the dignity of workers, the dignity of work and the good of the earth, our common home. #CoopsDay In difficult times, even more than in times of peace, the priority for believers is to be united to Jesus, our hope. https://t.co/UOkJI9XGw4 Through your attention to the little ones and to the poor, you can kindle stars in the night for those who suffer. The Bible is not just a beautiful book to keep on a shelf. It is the Word of life be sown, a gift that the Risen Jesus asks us to accept in order to have life in His name. We all go through difficult days at times, but we must always remember that life is a grace. It is the miracle that God drew forth from nothing. #StsPeterandPaul were transparent before God. Throughout life, they preserved this humility, to the very end. Both understood that holiness does not consist in exalting but rather humbling oneself. Pray for all Priests and for my Petrine Ministry, that every pastoral action may be sealed with the love that Christ has for every person. #SanctificationOfPriests Today we celebrate the 175th anniversary of the Pope\u2019s Worldwide Prayer Network. I invite you to pray with me to be united to the Heart of Jesus and to enter together into a mission of compassion for the world. Jesus looks at us, loves us and awaits us. He is all heart and all mercy. Let us go with confidence to Jesus. He always forgives us. #SacredHeartofJesus Blessed are those who believe and who have the courage to foster encounter and communion. How many times, in prayer, do we limit ourselves to asking for gifts and listing requests, forgetting that the first thing we should do is praise God\u2019s name, adore Him, and then go on to acknowledge His living image in our brothers and sisters. Saying \u201cyes\u201d to the Lord means having the courage to embrace life with love as it comes, with all its fragility and smallness, with all its contradictions. The example of Saint John the Baptist invites us to be a Church that is always at the service of the Word of God; a Church that does not want to draw attention to itself, but to Jesus Christ. Blessing is not about saying nice words or trite phrases; it is about speaking goodness, speaking with love. The Eucharist is itself a school of blessing. #CorpusDomini The Eucharist prepares us for a place in eternity, because it is the Bread of Heaven. #CorpusDomini The Beatitudes are not for supermen, but for those who confront the challenges and trials of every day. Without communion and without compassion that is constantly nourished by prayer, theology not only loses its soul, but loses the intelligence and the ability to intepret reality in a Christian way.  #NaplesVisit #VeritatisGaudium Dear young people, I would like to tell each one of you: God loves you; never doubt it, whatever happens to you in life; under any circumstances, you are infinitely loved. With refugees, Divine Providence offers us an opportunity to build a more supportive, more fraternal society, and a more open Christian community, according to the Gospel. #WithRefugees Jesus became bread broken for us, and He asks us to give ourselves to others, no longer to live for ourselves, but for one another. #CorpusDomini May the Holy Spirit lead us to live more fully as children of God and as brothers and sisters. Faith is a relationship, an encounter, and under the impetus of God's love we can communicate, welcome, and understand the gifts of others and respond to them. Holy Spirit, harmony of God, You who transform fear into trust and hard-heartedness into gift, come into us! Each one of us has infinite value for God: we may be small under heaven and powerless when the earth trembles, but for God we are more precious than anything. The mystery of the Most Holy Trinity tells us that we do not have a solitary God up there in heaven, far away; no, He is the Father who gave us his Son, who became man like us, and who sends his own Spirit to be even closer to us. The Holy Spirit calls all of us and helps us discover the beauty of being together and of journeying together, each in his or her own language and tradition but happy to be amongst brothers and sisters. I am close to many elderly people who live hidden away, forgotten, neglected. And I thank those who are committed to a more inclusive society, which does not need to throw away those who are weak in body and mind. #WEAAD Holy Spirit, our harmony, You who make us one body, infuse your peace in the Church and in the world! The #poor save us because they enable us to encounter the face of Jesus Christ. https://t.co/YpGX5crUF4 Holy Spirit, make us artisans of harmony, sowers of good, apostles of hope! As adults we must not rob children of their capacity to dream. Let us seek to promote an environment of hope, where their dreams may grow and be shared: A shared dream opens the path towards a new way of life. #NOChildLabourDay Give freely that which you have received freely, so that God's graces may reach the hearts of all. #SantaMarta Holy #MaryMotherOfTheChurch, help us to entrust ourselves fully to Jesus and to believe in His love, especially in times of trial, beneath the shadow of the Cross, when our faith is called to mature. To men and women missionaries, and to all those who, by virtue of their baptism, share in any way in the mission of the Church, I send my heartfelt blessing. #MissionaryOctober #Pentecost\nhttps://t.co/qKEspH4emp Holy Spirit, breathe into our hearts and let us inhale the tenderness of the Father. Breathe upon the Church, so that she may spread the Gospel with joy. Breathe upon the world the fresh restoration of hope. #Pentecost Lord, defuse the violence of our tongues and our hands. Renew our hearts and minds, so that the word which always brings us together will be \"brother\", and our way of life will always be: Peace. #OneMinuteForPeace How do I know the Lord listens to me? We have a certainty: Jesus. He is the great intercessor. He ascended into Heaven, and He stands before the Father to intercede for us. His prayer of intercession is never-ending. https://t.co/I8zoahTq2e Today, with gratitude to God, we remember that our body contains the elements of the planet: its air is that which gives us breath, and its water revives and restores us. #BeatAirPollution #LaudatoS\u00ec Euthanasia and assisted suicide are a defeat for all. We are called never to abandon those who are suffering, never giving up but caring and loving to restore hope. Without wonder, faith, like life, becomes grey and routine. The Ascension of our Lord into Heaven inaugurates a new form of the presence of Jesus amongst us, and asks us to have the eyes and the heart to encounter Him, serve Him, and be His witness to others. Fecioara Maria s\u0103-\u0219i \u00eentind\u0103 ocrotirea ei de mam\u0103 peste to\u021bi cet\u0103\u021benii Rom\u00e2niei care, \u00een decursul istoriei, \u0219i-au pus \u00eentotdeauna \u00eencrederea \u00een mijlocirea ei.

It is a way that demands effort, but the way that brings peace. #ApostolicJourney #Romania May you be witnesses of freedom and mercy, allowing fraternity and dialogue to prevail over divisions. #ApostolicJourney #Romania As Christians we are called to manifest, even on the internet, the communion that marks our identity as believers, opening the way to dialogue, encounter, and to smiles. #WorldCommunicationsDay The feast of the Ascension urges us to raise our eyes to Heaven, to fulfil, with the grace of our risen Lord, the mission He has entrusted to us: to announce the Gospel to everyone. God loves with a Father\u2019s love. Every life, and every one of us, belongs to him. #ApostolicJourney #Romania Let us journey together, allowing the Gospel to be the leaven that permeates everything and fills our peoples with the joy of salvation! #ApostolicJourney #Romania Dear parents, help your children discover the love of Jesus! This will make them strong and courageous. #GlobalParentsDay Contemplating Mary allows us to turn our gaze to all those many women, mothers and grandmothers who, by their quiet sacrifices, devotion and self-denial, are shaping the present and preparing the way for tomorrow\u2019s dreams. #ApostolicJourney #Romania The Holy Spirit loves to shape unity from the most beautiful and harmonious diversity. #ApostolicJourney #Romania Tomorrow I will go to Romania as a pilgrim, to walk together with our brothers of the Romanian Orthodox Church and with the Catholic faithful. I ask you, please, to pray for me. With His ascension the risen Lord draws our gaze to Heaven, to show us that the goal of our journey is the Father. If you trust in the goodness of the Lord, you will understand the meaning of events and the purpose of your life. In our lives there are crosses, there are difficult moments. But in these difficult moments we feel that the Holy Spirit helps us to go forward and to overcome the difficulties. #SantaMarta Even today so many Christians are killed and persecuted for the love of Christ. They give their lives in silence, because their martyrdom isn't newsworthy. Yet there are more Christian martyrs today than in the early centuries. It is the Spirit who makes us arise from our limitations, from our deaths, because we have so many necroses in our life, in our soul. The message of the Resurrection is this: we must be reborn. Mercy shown to those who can only receive, without giving anything in return, is precious in the eyes of God. Mary is a woman who walks with the grace and the tenderness of a mother; she unties all the knots of the many problems we manage to create, and she teaches us to stand upright in the midst of storms. #MaryHelpOfChristians We pray for the Catholics in China. May Our Lady of Sheshan help them witness to the faith, in communion with the universal Church, and to persevere in unity despite the wounds and the trials, trusting in the hope that does not disappoint. God does not reside in the greatness of that which we accomplish, but in the littleness of the poor persons that we meet. #Caritas Every creature has a function, none is superfluous. The whole universe speaks the language of God's love, of His boundless affection for us: soil, water, mountains, everything is God's caress. #Biodiversity #LaudatoS\u00ec' The peace of Jesus is a gift. We cannot obtain it through human means. The peace of Jesus is something else: the peace of Jesus teaches us to endure. To endure is to carry life on our shoulders, our difficulties, our work, everything, and to have the courage to go forward. We pray for those who live with severe illness. Let us always safeguard life, God's gift, from its beginning until its natural end. Let us not give in to a throwaway culture. Let us remain united to the Lord Jesus through listening to the Word, through the sacraments, a life of fraternity and service to others. It is the Spirit who is the protagonist of Christian life, the Holy Spirit, who is with us, accompanies us, transforms us, is victorious with us. Let yourself be transformed and renewed by the Holy Spirit, in order to bring Christ into every environment and to give witness to the joy and youthfulness of the Gospel! \u201cThe word of God is alive\u201d (Hebrews 4:12); it does not die or get old, but remains forever. Promoting the development of the #family means supporting and caring for every human person and for all of creation. #ClimateAction God proposes Himself, He never imposes Himself; He enlightens us, but never blinds us. Mary, Virgin of #Fatima, we are certain that each one of us is precious in your eyes and that nothing in our hearts has estranged you. Guard our life with your embrace, guide us all on the path to holiness. On this World Day of Prayer for Vocations, let us join in prayer and ask the Lord to help us discover his plan of love for our lives, and to grant us the courage to walk in the path that, from the beginning, he has chosen for each of us. #Vocations https://t.co/t5VV9caXjd God has placed this plan in our hearts and in all creation: to love Him, our brothers and sisters, and the whole world, and to find true happiness in this love. This is the time of mercy; this is the time of the Lord\u2019s compassion. Let us open our hearts so that He may come to us. Today we ask for the grace to be docile to the voice of the Lord and for a heart open to the Lord; for the grace not to be afraid to do great things and the sensitivity to pay attention to the small things. #SantaMarta If we live like children of God and we let ourselves be guided by the Holy Spirit, we do good to all creation as well. Virgin of the #HolyRosary, help us to be of one heart and one soul, a holy people journeying toward our Heavenly home. Faith must lead us believers to see other persons as our brothers and sisters that we need to support and love. #ApostolicJourney #NorthMacedonia https://t.co/ZgFHoIfz6R Mother Teresa, we ask you to intercede with Jesus, that we too may obtain the grace to be attentive to the cry of the poor, the sick, the outcast and the least of our brothers and sisters. #ApostolicJourney #NorthMacedonia \nhttps://t.co/wDp161d9UW May each of us, wherever we may be, in all that we do, be able to say: \u201cLord, make me an instrument of your peace\u201d. #ApostolicJourney #Bulgaria https://t.co/Ue5eb9ujsB As Pope John XXIII said: \u201cI never met a pessimist who managed to do something good\u201d. The Lord is the first not to be pessimistic. He constantly tries to open up paths of resurrection for all of us. #ApostolicJourney #Bulgaria Every morning, God comes to find us where we are.  He summons us to rise at his word, to look up and to realize that we were made for heaven. #ApostolicJourney #Bulgaria https://t.co/TXYMNdJj4v As Saint Cyril said: \u201cWith joy I set out for the Christian faith; however weary and physically weak, I will go with joy\u201d. #ApostolicJourney #Bulgaria https://t.co/nODVPVcXRY I ask you to accompany with your prayers my journey to Bulgaria and North Macedonia, which I begin tomorrow as a pilgrim of peace and fraternity. #ApostolicJourney In many countries May is the month of Mary. May the Mother of God accompany us and protect Christians in fighting against the forces of evil. Let us entrust ourselves to her and pray for the Church and for peace in the world. We need a journalism that is free, at the service of truth, goodness, and justice; a journalism that helps build a culture of encounter. #DefendMediaFreedom https://t.co/gaDiaAUt7c May St Joseph, the humble workman of Nazareth, direct us toward Christ, support the sacrifice of those who do good, and intercede for those who have lost their job or who are not successful in finding a job. Let us ask the Lord to grant us the awareness that we cannot truly be Christians unless we walk with the Holy Spirit, unless we let the Holy Spirit be the protagonist of our life. #SantaMarta God searches for you, even if you don\u2019t search for Him. God loves you, even if you have forgotten Him. God looks for beauty in you, even if you think you have uselessly squandered all your talents. If we open our hearts to mercy and we seal forgiveness with a fraternal embrace, we proclaim before the world that it is possible to overcome evil with good. #DivineMercy The Lord seeks everyone, He wants everyone to feel the warmth of His mercy and His love. During these #Easter days, proclaim with your life and with your words, the wonderful news that Jesus is Risen. Christ is risen, and with Him our creative hope arises to face the problems of our day, because we know we are not alone. #Easter The martyrs of all times, with their fidelity to Christ, tell us that injustice does not have the last word: we can continue to hope in the risen Lord. #Easter May the proclamation of the Lord's Resurrection sustain our hope and transform it into concrete acts of charity. #Easter Let us welcome Christ\u2019s victory over sin and death into our lives. In this way, we will draw His transforming power upon all creation as well. Today, too, let us join in prayer with the Christian community of Sri Lanka, which was struck by terrible violence on Easter Sunday. We entrust to the risen Lord the victims, the wounded and all the suffering. #PrayForSriLanka The resurrection of Christ is the true hope of the world. Happy #Easter! Today we contemplate the empty tomb of Christ and we hear the words of the angel: \"Do not be afraid! He is risen!\" #Easter Look at the open arms of Christ crucified, and let Him save you. Contemplate His blood shed out of love and let yourself be purified by it. In this way you can be reborn. #GoodFriday In the Eucharist you really meet Jesus, share His life, feel His love; there you experience that His death and resurrection are for you. #HolyThursday Christ died because He loves each one of us: young and old, saints and sinners, people of His time and people of our time. #HolyWeek Today we unite in prayer with the people of France, as we wait for the sorrow inflicted by the serious damage to be transformed into hope with reconstruction. Holy Mary, Our Lady, pray for us. #NotreDame Christ, out of love, sacrificed himself completely in order to save you. His outstretched arms on the cross are the most telling sign that he is a friend who is willing to stop at nothing. #HolyWeek Today, World Youth Day, I would like to mention all those young saints, especially the saints \u201cnext door\u201d to us, known only to God; sometimes he likes to surprise us with them. #DiocesanWYD By his self-abasement, Jesus wanted to open up to us the path of faith and to precede us on that path. #PalmSunday #HolyWeek https://t.co/wtJucvOUTo If we return to the Lord with our frailties, if we take the way of love, we will embrace the life that never fades. And we will experience joy. #Lent Fasting also means changing our attitude towards other people and towards all creatures: from the temptation to \u201cdevour\u201d everything to satisfy our greed, to the ability to suffer for love. #Lent From the Cross, Jesus teaches us the powerful courage of renunciation. Because we will never go forward if we are weighed down by heavy loads. #Lent Almsgiving helps us emerge from the foolishness of living to accumulate everything for ourselves, under the illusion of securing a future that is not ours. #Lent May the Lord always give us hope for the future and the strength to keep going. #SantaMarta Lenten fasting frees us from our attachment to things, from the worldliness that anaesthetizes the heart. #Lent During this time of #Lent we are invited to look to others too with charity, which frees us from the vanity of possessing, from thinking that things are good if they are good for me. #Lent invites us to look upward with prayer, which frees us from a horizontal, flat life, where we find time only for our ego, but forget God. #Lent is the time to rediscover our way back to life. The Lord is the destination of our journey in the world: the course must be set on Him. Fasting from sin gives hope to creation too, which will be \u201cset free from slavery to corruption and share in the glorious freedom of the children of God\u201d (Rom 8:21). #Lent https://t.co/DXkotQwsz7 When we pray, let us recall that we do so with Jesus. Jesus is our courage. Jesus is our security, who in this moment intercedes for us. #SantaMarta Through prayer we learn to renounce the idolatry and self-sufficiency of our ego, and to admit we need the Lord and His mercy. #Lent If you are young in years, but feel weak, weary or disillusioned, ask Jesus to renew you.  With him, hope never fails. #ChristusVivit https://t.co/BCRJCpKGgW The Church is young when she receives ever anew the strength born of God\u2019s Word, the Eucharist, and the daily presence of Christ and the power of His Spirit in our lives. The Church is young when she shows herself capable of constantly returning to her source. #ChristusVivit Christ is alive!  He is our hope, and in a wonderful way he brings youth to our world. #ChristusVivit https://t.co/BCRJCq2h8u Let us not pass this favourable time of #Lent in vain! Let us ask God to assist us on a journey of true conversion. I thank all the Moroccan people for your warm welcome. May the Almighty, Gracious and Merciful, protect you and bless Morocco! #ApostolicJourney Jesus invites us to contemplate the heart of our Father. Only from that perspective can we acknowledge once more that we are brothers and sisters. #ApostolicJourney Charity, especially towards the vulnerable, is the best opportunity we have to keep working to build up a culture of encounter. #ApostolicJourney Every human being has the right to life, to dream and to find his or her rightful place in our \u201ccommon home\u201d!  Every person has a right to the future. #ApostolicJourney The courage to encounter one another and extend a hand of friendship is a pathway of peace and harmony for humanity. #ApostolicJourney Dear Moroccan friends, I am coming as a pilgrim of peace and fraternity. We Christians and Muslims believe in God, the Creator and the Merciful, who created people to live like brothers and sisters, respecting each other in their diversity, and helping one another in their needs. Brothers and sisters, God calls us once again to conversion: let us pray to obtain the grace of a new life in Christ the Lord. #24hoursfortheLord If we do not listen to the voice of the Lord, our hearts become like soil without water. That is why the Lord says: \"Harden not your hearts\". #SantaMarta Where should we fix our gaze along the journey of #Lent? On the Crucifix. Jesus on the Cross is the compass of life that points us to Heaven. The culture of appearance, which leads us to live for passing things, is a great deception. Because it is like a flaring blaze: once it is over, only ashes remain. It is worthwhile to welcome every life because every man and woman is worth the blood of Christ himself. We cannot have contempt for what God has loved so much! #DayoftheUnbornChild Today we remember in prayer the victims of modern forms of #slavery. Their suffering impels us to fight against these inhuman scourges. #RememberSlavery May the Blessed Virgin help everyone, especially young people, to follow the path of peace and fraternity, based on welcome and forgiveness, on respect for others, and on the love that is the gift of self. Today we celebrate the Day of Memory of Missionary Martyrs, a motivation to witness with courage to our faith and to our hope in Him who, on the Cross, conquered hatred and violence with His love forever. Outward appearance, money, career, hobbies: these are sirens that enchant us and then set us adrift. #Lent is a time of grace to free our hearts from vanities. Let us thank God for \"sister water\", such a simple and precious element, and let us strive to make it accessible to all. #WorldWaterDay Today we think of people with #DownSyndrome. May they be welcomed, appreciated, and never discarded, right from their mother's womb. If we abandon the law of love, the law of the strongest over the weakest will be asserted. I express my sorrow and closeness to the dear people of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi, affected by Cyclone Idai. I entrust the many victims and their families to the mercy of God. #PrayForAfrica #cycloneIdai #Lent is rediscovering that we are made for the flame that always burns: for God, for the eternity of Heaven, and not for the world. Saint Joseph, spouse of the Virgin Mary, watch over the whole Church always, and protect Her in every moment. How do we not judge, not condemn, and forgive? \"Give and it will be given to you\": be generous in giving. Not only material alms, but spiritual alms too: spend time with someone in need, visit someone who is sick, offer a smile. #SantaMarta I pray for the victims of the horrible attack against two mosques in #Christchurch, New Zealand. I renew my invitation for prayer and gestures of peace to combat hatred and violence. Prayer reconnects us to God, charity to our neighbor, fasting to ourselves. God, my brothers and sisters, my life: these are the realities that do not end in nothing, and in which we must invest. #Lent #Lent is a journey of returning to the essential, during which the Lord asks us to follow three steps: almsgiving, prayer, and fasting. #Lent is a reminder to stop, to return to the essential, to fast from all that is superfluous and distracting. It is a wake-up call for the spirit. I ask everyone to remember in prayer both myself and my collaborators in the Roman Curia, who this evening will be beginning the week of Spiritual Exercises. Only those who leave behind their earthly attachments in order to set out will find the mystery of God. Women make the world beautiful, they protect it and keep it alive. They bring the grace of renewal, the embrace of inclusion, and the courage to give of oneself. #InternationalWomensDay At the beginning of Lent, it would do us good to ask for the grace to preserve the memory of all that the Lord has done in our lives, of how He has loved us. #SantaMarta The Lenten journey begins today, Ash Wednesday. I invite each of you to live this time in an authentic spirit of penance and conversion, like a return to the Father, who awaits us all with open arms. https://t.co/ib8t4TG2tv Prayer gives consistency and vitality to everything we do. Let us hear the cry of the earth, wounded in a thousand ways by human greed. Let us allow her to remain a welcoming home, in which no one feels excluded. #WorldWildlifeDay Sometimes we may feel we are alone in facing difficulties. But, even if He doesn\u2019t intervene immediately, the Lord walks by our side and, if we keep going forward, He will open up a new path. In order to pray well, we need to have the heart of a child. Let\u2019s take a little time every day to examine our conscience, to convert to the Lord. Five minutes at the end of each day will help us think about a change of heart and conversion to the Lord, without procrastination. #SantaMarta If you believe in God you must try to live justly with everyone, according to the golden rule: \u201cDo to others whatever you would have them do to you\u201d (Mt 7,12). Religious life consists in loving God with all your heart, and your neighbour as yourself. God\u2019s love is the only power capable of making all things new. Every abuse is an atrocity. In people's justified anger, the Church sees the reflection of the wrath of God. It is our duty to listen attentively to this silent cry. #PBC2019 https://t.co/Gx9M9MgzTX Lord, focus our gaze on what is essential, make us strip ourselves of everything that does not help to make the Gospel of Jesus Christ transparent. #PBC2019 Lord, deliver us from the temptation to want to save ourselves, and our reputations; help us to acknowledge our guilt and to seek humble and concrete answers together, and in communion with all the People of God. #PBC2019 Lord, you know how we resist placing the sufferings of others in our heart. Open our hearts and shape them in your image. #PBC2019 Let us ask the Holy Spirit to sustain us during these days and to help us transform this evil into an opportunity for awareness and purification. #PBC2019 As of tomorrow, we will live several days of dialogue and communion, of listening and discernment. May it be a time of conversion. We don't proclaim ourselves, but He who died for us. #PBC2019 In the darkest moments of our history, the Lord draws near, opens paths, lifts up discouraged faith, anoints wounded hope, and awakens sleeping charity. Let us enter into the mystery of the sorrowful heart of God who is Father, and let us speak with Him as we witness the many calamities of our time. #SantaMarta I invite you to pray during these days for the Meeting on the Protection of Minors in the Church, an event that I want to be a powerful gesture of pastoral responsibility in the face of an urgent challenge of our time. Christians promote peace, starting with the community in which they live. Jesus asks us to produce just one work of art, which is possible for everyone: that of our own life. Truth is the wonderful revelation of God, of His Fatherly face. It is His boundless love. Those who love use their imagination to discover solutions where others see only problems. Those who love help others according to their needs and with creativity, not according to preconceived ideas or common conceptions. https://t.co/kvYb0HUNcE Detachment from worldly appearances is essential to prepare ourselves for heaven. Thousands of children, forced to fight in armed conflicts, are robbed of their childhood. Let us stop this abominable crime. #ChildrenNotSoldiers A generous attitude towards the sick is salt of the earth and light of the world. May Our Lady of Lourdes help us to practice it, and obtain peace and comfort for all those who suffer.  https://t.co/yImNmXsb0A If we practice seeing with the eyes of Jesus, we will always be able to recognize those who need our help. Love of God and love of neighbour are inseparable. They are two sides of the same coin: lived together they are the true strength of believers! Life has value when we give it, when we give it in love, in truth; when we give it to others, in everyday life, in the family. #SantaMarta Human trafficking is a terrible violation of human dignity. Let us open our eyes to this shameful scourge and commit ourselves to fighting it. #TogetherAgainstHumanTrafficking @M_RSection https://t.co/nRM29qeH7P We all need to be healed, and we can all heal others if we are humble and meek: with a good word, with patience, with a glance. #SantaMarta This Visit to the United Arab Emirates belongs to the \"surprises\" of God. So let us praise Him and His providence, and pray that the seeds sown may bring forth fruits of peace. #ApostolicJourney #UAE The Beatitudes are a roadmap for our life: they invite us to keep our hearts pure, to practice meekness and justice, to be merciful to all, to live affliction in union with God. #UAE #ApostolicJourney Saint Francis reminds us that Christians set out armed only with their humble faith and concrete love. If we live in the world according to the ways of God, we will become channels of His presence. #UAE #ApostolicJourney Prayer purifies the heart from turning in on itself. Prayer of the heart restores fraternity. #UAE #ApostolicJourney The Document on Human Fraternity, which I signed today in Abu Dhabi with my brother the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, invites all persons who have faith in God and faith in human fraternity to unite and work together. https://t.co/74Ig3XOPzw God is with those who seek peace. From heaven He blesses every step which, on this path, is accomplished on earth. #UAE #ApostolicJourney I am about to leave for the United Arab Emirates. I am visiting that Country as a brother, in order to write a page of dialogue together, and to travel paths of peace together. Pray for me! Consecrated life is a living encounter with the Lord in his people. It is a call to the faithful obedience of daily life, and to the unexpected surprises from the Spirit. It is a vision of what we need to embrace in order to experience joy: Jesus. May the Lord give us the grace of memory and of hope, in order to go forward with perseverance on the journey of our life. #SantaMarta Don Bosco had the courage to look at reality with human eyes and with the eyes of God. May every priest imitate him by seeing reality with human eyes and with the eyes of God. #SantaMarta The secret to navigating life well is to invite Jesus on board. The helm of life should be given to Him, so that He can direct the route. Meekness and tenderness: these human virtues seem small, but they can overcome the most difficult conflicts. I thank God for having given us the opportunity to share these days together and to experience once more this World Youth Day. My thanks go to all those who have supported us with their prayers, and who have helped by their efforts and hard work! #Panama2019 Go forth and bear witness to what you have seen and heard, not with lots of words but with simple, daily actions. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be present at the next WYD, but Peter will certainly be there, and he will confirm you in the faith. #Panama2019 Let us pray for the victims of the terrorist attack on the Cathedral of Jolo, in the Philippines. May the Lord, Prince of Peace, convert the hearts of the violent, and grant the inhabitants of that region a peaceful coexistence. Here in Panama, I have thought a lot about the Venezuelan people, to whom I feel particularly united in these days. In the face of the serious ongoing situation, I ask you to pray that a just and peaceful solution may be reached. To you, dear young people, a big \u201cthank you\u201d for #Panama2019. Keep walking. Keep living the faith and sharing it. See you in Lisbon in 2022! Let us not forget the victims of the Holocaust. Their unspeakable suffering continues to cry out to humanity: We are all brothers and sisters! #RemembranceDay Only what is loved can be saved. Only what is embraced can be transformed. #Panama2019 With her \u201cyes\u201d, Mary became the most influential woman in history. Without social networks, she became the first \u201cinfluencer\u201d: the \u201cinfluencer\u201d of God. #Panama2019 Let us not quench our thirst with just any water but with the \u201cspring of water welling up to eternal life\u201d. #Panama2019 Friends, Jesus teaches us to believe. Seek out and listen to the voices that encourage you to look ahead, not those that pull you down. #Panama2019 In this WYD #Panama2019 I invite you to pray all together the Holy Rosary for Peace through @clicktoprayapp. What prompts us to encounter each other in this WYD? The certainty of knowing that we have been loved with a profound love that we neither can nor want to keep quiet about a love that challenges us to respond in the same way: with love. #Panama2019 This is the network we want, a network created not to entrap, but to liberate, to protect a communion of people who are free. https://t.co/qZ9XI2rDPe I am leaving for the World Youth Day in Panama. I ask you to pray for this very beautiful and important event on the path of the Church. Saying \u201cyes\u201d to God\u2019s love is the first step to being happy, and to making many other people happy. The Christian way is that of the Beatitudes: meekness, humility, patience in suffering, love for justice, ability to endure persecution, not judging others... #SantaMarta What will remain on the threshold of eternity is not how much we earned, but how much we gave away. Prayer from a humble heart is heard by God. Today marks the beginning of the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity: all of us are asked to implore from God this great gift. Let us be careful not to have a perverse heart that leads to cowardice; an obstinate heart that leads to being shut off; a heart that is slave to the seduction that leads to a Christian life of compromise. #SantaMarta The Spirit of God speaks freely to each person through feelings and thoughts. The Spirit cannot be confined with simple reasoning, but must be welcomed with the heart! Don\u2019t let the sufferings you see frighten you. Place them before the Crucifix and the Eucharist from which we draw patient and compassionate love. Let us look at our hands, often so empty of love, and today let us try to think of some gift we can offer freely. Baptism is the best gift we have received. Through it, we belong to God and we possess the joy of salvation. Smallness is freedom. One who is small, in the Gospel sense, is unencumbered and free from any urge to show off, and from any claim to success. The first step in prayer is to be humble, go to the Father and say: \u201cLook at me, I am a sinner.\u201d And the Lord listens. The spirit of the world is conquered with the spirit of faith: believing that God is really in the brother and sister who are close to me. #SantaMarta Do not be afraid to weep when you encounter difficult situations: tears are drops that irrigate life. Tears of compassion purify hearts and feelings. https://t.co/P8SNqoRiCW Love does not tolerate indifference; love is compassionate. Love means putting your heart on the line for others. #SantaMarta God became man in Jesus in order to share our lives. Let us keep this relationship alive with Him and with one another. Happy Christmas to our Christian brothers and sisters from the East. The Magi offered their precious gifts to the Christ Child. Today, let us ask God: Lord, help me rediscover the joy of giving. The Church grows in silence, in prayer, and with the good works that give witness. Jesus is the gift of God for us. If we welcome Him, we too can be a gift of God to others. If we live as Jesus taught us, and in harmony with what we proclaim, our witness will bear fruit. To make peace is to imitate God, who wants to make peace with us: He sent us his Son, and He has forgiven us. Today more than ever, our societies need \u201cartisans of peace\u201d, messengers and witnesses of God the Father, who wills the good and the happiness of the human family.\nhttps://t.co/9MM3oLU4gf May Mary, Mother of God, protect and accompany us during this new year and bring the peace of her Son into our hearts and the world. Let us give thanks to God for the year drawing to an end, recognizing that all the good is His gift. May Jesus, Mary and Joseph bless and protect all families around the world, so that love, joy and peace may reign within them. Bring God\u2019s tenderness and mercy to all those who are discarded by society. Let us welcome God\u2019s love in the Christ Child, and let us commit ourselves to making the world more humane and worthy for the children of today and tomorrow. Looking at Jesus we see the face of the God who is Love, and we learn to recognize Him in the faces of our brothers and sisters. The Church grows with the blood of the martyrs, men and women who give their lives for Jesus. Today there are many, even if they do not make the headlines. Christ is born for us! Come, all of you who are seeking the face of God. Here He is, the Child lying in the manger. By contemplating God, who became a child, radiating light from the humility of the crib, we can also become witnesses to humility, tenderness and goodness. #Christmas The lights of the Christmas tree remind us that Jesus is the light of the world, the light of our souls that drives away the darkness of hatred and makes room for forgiveness. #Christmas Let us entrust ourselves to Our Lady so that she may help us prepare our hearts to welcome Baby Jesus at his birth. #Christmas May the symbols of the nativity scene and the Christmas tree allow a reflection of God's light and tenderness to enter into family life. #Christmas God enters history and does so in His original style: surprise. The God of surprises always surprises us. #SantaMarta Advent is a time for us to prepare for the coming of Jesus, Prince of Peace. It's a time to make peace with ourselves and our neighbours. #Advent Be like Saint Joseph: a man of dreams, not a dreamer; a man of silence, because he respects God's plan. #SantaMarta Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed. May our hearts not be closed as were the houses in Bethlehem. #Internationalmigrantsday \"O Wisdom from the mouth of the Most High, you fill the whole world. With strength and gentleness you order all things: come to teach us the way of prudence.\" #AdventAntiphons Joy, prayer and gratitude are three ways that prepare us to experience Christmas in an authentic way. #Advent Our life spreads light when it is given in service. The secret of joy is living to serve. This is the first step in order to grow on our journey of faith: listening. Before speaking, listen. Even when we pray alone, we pray together with all the people of God. Let us beg the Virgin Mary, Our Lady of Guadalupe, to continue accompanying and protecting the peoples of the American continent. #VirgendeGuadalupe \"Comfort, comfort my people\" (Is 40,1). How does the Lord give comfort? With tenderness. #SantaMarta Keep the faith. In this second week of Advent, we ask for the grace to prepare ourselves with faith to celebrate Christmas. #SantaMarta Every human person, created in God\u2019s image and likeness, is a value unto themselves and is subject to inalienable rights. #HumanRightsDay Advent is a time to recognize the emptiness needs to be filled in our lives, a time to smooth the rough edges of pride, and to make room for Jesus who comes. #Advent What is the secret of Mary\u2019s beauty, \u201ctota pulchra\u201d? Not appearances, or that which passes, but a heart totally centred on God. Loving God means serving our neighbour without reserve, and trying to forgive without limits. https://t.co/KKGg8LN05T \"Saying or doing?\" Am I a Christian of words or deeds? \"Sand and rock?\" Am I building my life on the rock of God, or on the sand of worldliness? \"High or low?\" Is my life inspired by the Magnificat? #SantaMarta The beginning of faith is feeling the need for salvation: this is the way that prepares us to meet Jesus. This Advent, make yourself small, make yourself humble, make yourself a servant of others, and the Lord will give you the ability to understand how to make peace. #SantaMarta Advent is a time for renewing the faith, for purifying it, so that it can be more authentic. #SantaMarta So many persons with disabilities and difficulties reopen their hearts to life when they realize they are loved! And how much love can flow from a heart thanks to the remedy of a smile! #WorldDisabilityDay Let us lift the veil of indifference that weighs on the destiny of those who suffer. Nobody can wash their hands when faced with the tragic reality of modern slavery. #EndSlavery Advent is the time to welcome the Lord who comes to meet us, the time to look ahead, and to prepare ourselves for Christ\u2019s return. #Advent There is no such thing as the perfect family. Only by the daily exercise of forgiveness can a family grow. Let us ask the Lord for the grace to leave everything in order to go forward in proclamation and witness, just as Peter and Andrew did. #SantaMarta Faced with the tragedies of life, we are called to look to the horizon, because we have been redeemed and the Lord will come to save us. #SantaMarta We cannot truly follow Jesus when we are weighed down by things, because if the heart is crowded with other goods, there will be no room for the Lord, who will become just one thing among others. This week the Church invites us to ask ourselves: what state do I want the Lord to find me in when He calls? #SantaMarta Let us ask the Lord for the grace of being generous, so that our hearts may be opened and we may become kinder. #SantaMarta While the great ones of the Earth build themselves \u2018thrones\u2019 for their own power, God chooses an uncomfortable throne, the cross, from which to reign by giving his life. None of us can survive without mercy. We all have need for forgiveness. Men and women bear God\u2019s image within and are the object of His infinite love, in whatever condition they were called into existence. In the eyes of God human life is precious, sacred and inviolable. No one can despise the lives of others or one\u2019s own life. May the Virgin Mary help us joyfully follow Jesus on the way of service, the royal road that leads to Heaven. Since today is World Fisheries Day, let us pray for all seafarers and advocate for a global commitment to stop human trafficking and forced labor in the fishing industry. #WorldFisheriesDay Faithfulness is the characteristic of free, mature and responsible human relationships. You cannot love only as long as it is \u201cadvantageous\u201d. Love manifests itself when it goes beyond one\u2019s own self-interest, and when it is given without reservation. Let us ask for the grace to open our eyes and hearts to the poor in order to hear their cry and recognize their needs. #WorldDayofthePoor \nhttps://t.co/k9cpvCu8QR Nobody can delude themselves by thinking, \u201cI\u2019m fine because I\u2019m not doing anything wrong\u201d. To be a follower of Jesus it is not enough not to do wrong, because there is good that we must do! Do not follow Jesus only when you feel like it, rather, seek Him every day. Find in Him the God who loves you always, the meaning of your life and the strength to give of yourself. \"The Kingdom of God is in your midst.\" It is not spectacular. It grows in silence, in hiding, through witness, prayer, and the attraction of the Spirit. #SantaMarta Jesus is not pleased with a \u201cpercentage of love\u201d: we cannot love him at twenty, fifty or sixty percent. It\u2019s all or nothing. The first step to knowing Jesus Christ is to recognize our own poverty and our need to be saved. Let us pray today for bishops so that they may always be what Saint Paul calls them to be: humble, gentle, servants. #SantaMarta Sunday is a holy day for us, sanctified by the celebration of the Eucharist, which is the living presence of the Lord among us and for us. #sundaymass The scientific community today is called to establish a leadership that offers solutions for the sustainable and integral development of all peoples, which is indispensable for building peace. #WorldScienceDay Where there is sin there is also the merciful Lord God who forgives if you go to Him. #SantaMarta May the Lord help us understand the logic of the Gospel, that of mercy with bearing witness. #SantaMarta Praying means knocking at the door of a friend. God is our friend. https://t.co/mV5lLyeMS2 Jesus invites us to celebrate with Him, to be close to Him, to change our lives. #SantaMarta Let us commit ourselves with prayer and action to distance our hearts, our words and our deeds from all violence in order to take care of our common home. Jesus loved us freely. Christian life is imitating Jesus' free love.  #SantaMarta Sunday Mass is at the heart of the Church\u2019s life. There we encounter the Risen Lord, we listen to His Word, we are nourished at His table, and thus we become Church. #sundaymass God is faithful and our hope in Him is like a fixed anchor in heaven. Jesus made it so death does not have the last word: those who believe in Him will be transfigured by the Father's merciful love for an eternal and blessed life. Today we celebrate the feast of holiness. Let us strengthen the bonds of love and communion with all the Saints who are already in God's presence. We need smiling Christians, not because they take things lightly, but because they are filled with the joy of God, because they believe in love and live to serve. If you want to listen to the Lord\u2019s voice, set out on the journey, live out your search. The Lord speaks to those who search. We are called to listen to what the Spirit tells us. The Holy Spirit is always something new. To all of you who have taken part in this \u201cjourney together\u201d, I say \u201cthank you\u201d.  May the Lord bless our steps, so that we can listen to young people, be their neighbours, and bear witness before them to Jesus, the joy of our lives. #Synod2018 https://t.co/wRMOaKwkSI Faith is life: it is living in the love of God who has changed our lives. Faith has to do with encounter, not theory.  #Synod2018 https://t.co/wRMOaKeK1a I would like to say to the young people: forgive us if often we have not listened to you, if, instead of opening our hearts, we have filled your ears. #Synod2018 https://t.co/wRMOaKeK1a You will build the future, with your hands, with your heart, with your love, with your passions, with your dreams. Together with others. Saint Paul gives us very practical advice about preserving unity: \"Bear with one another in love\". #SantaMarta It would be wonderful if, every day, at some moment, we could say: \"Lord, let me know you and let me know myself\". #SantaMarta Health is not a consumer good, but a universal right: let us unite our efforts so that health services are available to all. #HealthForAll This Synod is intended to be a sign of the Church that truly listens and that doesn\u2019t always have a ready-made answer. #Synod2018 Hope is not an idea, it is an encounter; like the woman waiting to meet the child who will be born from her womb. #SantaMarta The company of the saints helps us to recognize that God never abandons us, so that we can live and bear witness to hope on this earth. Join Caritas and walk 1 million kilometres together with migrants &amp; refugees. We are all on the Road to Emmaus being called to see the face of Christ. #sharejourney https://t.co/pJBkxwObDK The transmission of the faith, heart of the Church's mission, comes about by the \"infectiousness\" of love. #Missio https://t.co/XFROixfbOC God can act in any circumstance, even in the midst of apparent defeat. The leaven of Christians is the Holy Spirit that allows us to grow amidst the difficulties of the journey, but always with hope. #SantaMarta The road of the disciple is one of poverty. Disciples are poor because their richness is Jesus. #SantaMarta When we listen to the Word of God, we obtain the courage and perseverance to offer the best of ourselves to others. Open your heart and let the Lord's grace enter in. Salvation is a gift, not a way of presenting yourself outwardly. #SantaMarta https://t.co/gV4DMhl9pC The world needs saints, and all of us, without exception, are called to holiness. We are not afraid! Let us defend ourselves from the risk of being actors rather than witnesses. We are called to be living memory of the Lord. What is worse: the recognizable demon that pushes you to sin so that you feel ashamed, or the well-mannered demon that lives within you and possesses you with the spirit of worldliness? #SantaMarta Praying is not like using a magic wand. Prayer requires commitment, constancy and determination. #SantaMarta The newness of the Gospel transfigures us inside and out: spirit, soul, body, and everyday life. Spend time before the Lord in contemplation, and do everything possible for the Lord at the service of others. Contemplation and service: this is our path of life. #SantaMarta Each of us is the wounded man, and the Good Samaritan is Jesus, who approached us and took care of us. #SantaMarta #OurLadyOfTheRosary\n#PrayForTheChurch https://t.co/2rw3psySOy We ask the Lord for the gifts of dialogue and patience, of the closeness and welcome that loves, pardons and doesn't condemn. Let us ask the Holy Spirit to throw open the doors of our hearts so that Jesus can enter and bring us His message of salvation. #SantaMarta In a decisive moment of his youth, Saint Francis of Assisi read the Gospel. Still today the Gospel lets you know the living Jesus, it speaks to your heart and it changes your life. We ask for the grace to listen to one another, in order to discern together what the Lord is asking of His Church. #Synod2018 The presence of our Guardian Angel in our life is not just to assist us along the journey, but to show us where we need to go. #SantaMarta We fly to Thy protection, O Holy Mother of God. Do not despise our petitions in our necessities, but deliver us always from all dangers, O Glorious and Blessed Virgin. #PrayForTheChurch The holy anxiety for the Gospel is the only anxiety that gives peace. Sunday is the day to say to God: thank you Lord, for life, for your mercy, and for all your gifts! St Michael, help us to fight for our salvation. St Gabriel, bring us the Good News that gives hope. St Raphael, protect us on our journey. Life becomes more beautiful when we discover that our spirit finds rest in God alone. Jesus gave us a simple programme for journeying towards holiness: the commandment of love for God and our neighbor. I hope that a new phase may open up in China, that will help to heal the wounds of the past, restore and maintain full communiion with all Chinese Catholics, and take up the proclamation of the Gospel with renewed commitment. https://t.co/fyMTrtkJFi Let us pray that programmes for development may predominate in the world, and not those for weapons. The Lord draws good out of evil through His power and His infinite creativity. Let us allow the Holy Spirit to clothe us with the weapons of dialogue, understanding, the search for mutual respect and fellowship! Let us offer our lives in service and in joy, to make known to everyone that Jesus Christ is our only hope! The witness of St Padre Pio of Pietrelcina encourages us to live the Beatitudes through prayer and works of mercy. Peace is a choice: it cannot be imposed and it isn\u2019t found by chance. If you want to reach the heart of God, take the way of mercy, and allow yourself to be treated with mercy. #SantaMarta We ask that Jesus protect our Church always, that He protect Her with His mercy, granting each one of us His forgiveness. #SantaMarta Goodness is loving and never imposes itself. It is a choice. Meek and humble of heart, close to the people, with compassion, with meekness and tenderness. This is Jesus. #SantaMarta It takes effort to always do good\u2026 The road to holiness is not for the lazy! Let us deal with climate change through international cooperation: each person\u2019s choices have repercussions on the life of everyone. Only by giving our life do we conquer evil. This is what Don Pino Puglisi teaches: he lived to spread goodness. In the suffering that ecclesial wounds cause us, we embrace the Cross of Christ, because evil can only be opposed with love. Today the Church invites us to contemplate the Cross of Our Lord. Contemplating the Cross for us Christians means contemplating both a sign of defeat and a sign of victory. #SantaMarta When I am merciful, I am a true child of the Father, because the Father is merciful. #SantaMarta Mary our Mother knows the joys and difficulties that we experience along our journey. Jesus came down on earth so that we could go up to heaven: this is the mystery of the Cross. Let us involve ourselves in our relationship of love with Jesus and we will be able to perform good works that have the fragrance of the Gospel. God never goes back on His love! May the Virgin Mary help us abandon ourselves with joy to God\u2019s plan for our lives. Without the right to education there is no real freedom, which allows every person to be the protagonist of their own destiny! Remember the more you give yourselves to others, the more you will receive and be happy! Carry peace with you to give it to others with your life, with a smile, with works of charity. Saint Mother Teresa, pray for us! Faith helps us grasp the meaning of life: God is with us and loves us infinitely. True peace is a gift of God that springs from healed and reconciled hearts and reaches out to embrace the entire world. May God's love become more and more the force that guides and directs our freedom. May the Lord strengthen our efforts to care for our common home, and especially for water, a basic good that must be protected and made available to everyone. https://t.co/yS2OZeJg9I The love of Christ, welcomed with an open heart, changes us, transforms us, and makes us able to love. We Christians do not have a product to sell, we communicate Life. To pray is the first missionary task of every Christian. It is also the most effective. If the Lord has gifted you with riches, it is in order to do lots of good things for others in His name. Dear Mothers, be like Saint Monica and never give up. Pray unceasingly for your children. May God\u2019s blessing come down upon all your families, so that they may be places of love and forgiveness. I ask our Blessed Mother to intercede for the healing of the survivors of abuse and to confirm every member of our Christian family in the resolve never again to permit these situations to occur. Is there anything precious that endures at all? Even love itself? Love is God\u2019s dream for us and for the whole human family. Please, never forget this! Our world needs a revolution of love!  Let that revolution begin with you and your families! The #Family is an icon of God: the bond between a man and a woman generates life and communion. The #Family is the cradle of life and the school of love and acceptance. It is a window thrown open to the mystery of God. We must protect the #Family. Our future depends on it. The #Family is where hope is forged. Today the World Meeting of #Families begins in Dublin. Let us join in prayer with all the families of the world, especially those in difficulty. @WMOF2018 @LaityFamilyLife May the Holy Spirit grant us the grace of conversion and the interior anointing needed to express before crimes of abuse our compunction and our resolve courageously to combat them.\u00a0https://t.co/3CDnYUBLid The Eucharist, Jesus the Bread of Life, is the beating heart of the Church and renews in us the impulse to love. Love overcomes all difficulties. Love gives us the strength to carry on. By embracing God\u2019s love, we change the world and transform history. Faith is nourished by memory: how many wonderful things God has done for us! How generous is our heavenly Father! Mary, Mother of tenderness who is always near, teach us how to live and have faith. Still today there are so many martyrs, so many who are persecuted for the love of Christ. They are the real strength of the Church! Thanks to the gift of the Eucharist, our lives too become \u201cbread broken\u201d for our brothers and sisters. In silence we learn to contemplate God\u2019s works, which surpass all our imagination. When we place ourselves at the service of our most vulnerable brothers and sisters we experience the joy of unconditional love. The Kingdom of God grows in a mysterious and surprising way throughout the world with the power of a tiny seed. Evil tries to convince us that death is the end of everything. But the Risen Christ reveals a new dimension of eternal life! Jesus reveals the love-filled face of God. The disciples\u2019 experience on Mount Tabor is an invitation to us to abandon worldly things and to contemplate Jesus. The Eucharist is our \u201creservation\u201d for Heaven: Jesus leads us on our journey towards eternal life. Support your priests with friendship and affection. More than anything else, the life of a Christian is a grateful response to a generous Father. Charity is the most effective form of witness, because in it people see the love of God. Every Church member has a responsibility to become holy, by taking care of others. Before helping others, we need to have a personal encounter with God: we need time to pray and to listen to His Word. Hear the cry of our many brothers and sisters who are criminally trafficked and exploited. They are not merchandise. They are human beings, and they must be treated as such. #EndHumanTrafficking @M_RSection Holiness is not only about the spirit: it is also the feet that take us to our brothers and sisters, and the hands that allow us to help them. Grandparents are a treasure in the family. Please, take care of your grandparents: love them and let them talk to your children! Prayer is never in vain: it always brings forth something new that, sooner or later, bears fruit. God wants us to call Him Father, with the trust of children who abandon themselves in the arms of the One who gave them life. Jesus invites us to build the civilization of love together in the situations we are called to live every day. May the Virgin Mary, Mother and Queen of Carmel, accompany you on your daily journey towards the Mountain of God. Try reading the Gospel for at least five minutes every day. You will see how it changes your life. Europe rediscovers hope when the human person is at the heart of its institutions. St Benedict, pray for us! You too are like the Good Samaritan when you recognize the face of Christ in those near you. Every occasion is a good one to spread Christ's message! May all humanity hear the cry of the children of the Middle East. Drying their tears the world will get back it's dignity. The God of all consolation, who heals the broken hearts and takes care of the wounds, hear our prayer: Let there be peace in the Middle East! The suffering of so many of our brothers and sisters, persecuted for the sake of the Gospel, is an urgent reminder that we Christians must be more united. Do we know how to silence our hearts and listen to the voice of God? We receive God's graces to share them with others. I ask all of you to join me in prayer as I travel to Bari on Saturday on a pilgrimage to pray for peace in the long-suffering Middle East. When we are firmly united to the God who loves and sustains us, we are able to withstand all life\u2019s difficulties and challenges. Every kind of material or spiritual poverty, every form of discrimination against our brothers and sisters, comes from turning our backs on God and His love. Let us pray for the new Cardinals: may they assist me in my ministry as Bishop of Rome, for the good of all God\u2019s people. We are called to assist the elderly, the sick and the unborn: life must always be protected and loved, from conception to its natural conclusion. Torture is a mortal sin! Christian communities must commit themselves to helping victims of torture. Faith in Jesus Christ frees us from sin, sadness, emptiness, isolation. It is the source of a joy that no one can ever take away. Like St John the Baptist, Christians have to humble themselves so that the Lord can grow in their hearts. Let us ask our Lord to help us understand that love is service, love means taking care of others. Love for others needs to become the constant factor of our lives. Praying together, walking together, working together: this is the way that leads to Christian unity. #WCC70 Dear young people, help us adults whose hearts are often hardened. Help us to choose the path of dialogue and harmony. A person's dignity does not depend on them being a citizen, a migrant, or a refugee. Saving the life of someone fleeing war and poverty is an act of humanity. #WithRefugees @M_RSection We encounter Jesus in those who are poor, rejected, or refugees. Do not let fear get in the way of welcoming our neighbour in need. #WithRefugees @M_RSection Choosing to follow Christ helps build a more just, more friendly, more humane society, that is closer to the heart of God. Let us try to express the joy of God\u2019s Kingdom in every way possible! Let us share the journey of refugees and migrants with concrete gestures of solidarity. #sharejourney https://t.co/JzbCKhVP1O Invite the Holy Spirit to be part of your activities. Call upon Him before you even start: \u201cCome, Holy Spirit!\u201d. Love is always at the service of others. Because love is seen in actions, not words. I send my cordial greetings to all those following the World Soccer Championships that begin today in Russia. I hope this sports event may be a positive opportunity for encounter and fellowship. No one is so poor they cannot give what they have, but first and foremost, who they are. Never tire of encountering Jesus in prayer, in listening to the Word of God, and in receiving the Eucharist. Children must be able to play, study and grow in a peaceful environment. Woe to anyone who stifles their joyful impulse to hope! The Holy Spirit gives us the strength we need to achieve holiness in the midst of our everyday lives. Whatever we do, let us sustain the voice of the Holy Spirit through practical good deeds and actions. Mary is exactly what God wants His Church to be: a loving and humble Mother, poor in possessions but rich in love. Let us ask the Lord to give us good priests: hardworking men, men of prayer, who are close to God\u2019s people. The Feast of the Sacred Heart reminds us that God loved us first: He is always waiting for us, welcoming us into His heart, into His love. For those who are with Jesus, evil is just a provocation to love even more. Loving Christ is not a superficial sentiment. It is an attitude of the heart that we demonstrate when we live as He wants us to. Lord, reawaken in us a sense of praise and gratitude for our Earth, and for everything you have created. The living presence of Christ within us is the light that guides our choices, the flame that warms our hearts as we go to meet the Lord. On this Feast of Corpus Christi, we need to remember that Jesus, the Bread of Life, is our strength and support on life's journey. Seek the Lord in prayer: He is the one who has called you. Love can recognize good things even in bad situations. Love keeps a tiny flame alight even in the darkest night. The Eucharist contains all the flavour of Jesus\u2019 words and deeds, the taste of His Death and Resurrection, the fragrance of His Spirit. When the Holy Spirit is present, something always happens. Where blows the Spirit, things are never at a standstill. The Eucharist gives us the strength to produce the fruits of good works, and to live true Christian lives. What lasts? What has value in life? What treasures don\u2019t disappear?\nDefinitely two: God and our neighbor. The mystery of the Blessed Trinity invites us to live in communion with one another, in love and in sharing: certain that wherever there is love, there is God. The Gospel calls us to live outside our comfort zone, because anyone who follows Jesus, loves the poor and the lowly. Love of God and love of neighbour should be the two cornerstones of our lives. Today we are united in prayer with our Catholic brothers and sisters in China, on the Feast of Our Lady Help of Christians of Sheshan. A Church that loves the poor is always tuned to the God Channel. It never loses the Gospel signal. A Christian\u2019s life should be invested in Jesus, and spent for others. God needs people who bring His forgiveness and His mercy into the world. Holy Spirit, you who sustain the Church, come down upon us again, teach us unity, renew our hearts, and help us to love as Jesus taught us. Never forget this golden rule: \u201cDo to others what you would have them do to you\u201d (Mt 7,12) Mary lived Jesus\u2019 Beatitudes like no other: she is saintly among the saints, she shows us the way to holiness and accompanies us. God loves us in a way that crushes all loneliness and isolation. I express my great sorrow over the dead and wounded in the Holy Land and the Middle East. Violence never leads to peace. Therefore, I call on all sides involved and the international community to renew efforts so that dialogue, justice and peace may prevail. There is no love without works of charity. Service towards our brothers and sisters springs from the heart that loves. The Family is the hope of the future. Let us pray especially for families facing serious difficulties: may Our Lord assist them. There is no freedom greater than letting yourself be guided by the Holy Spirit and allowing Him to lead you wherever he wishes. I invite communications professionals to promote a journalism of peace at the service of all people, especially those without a voice. #WorldCommunicationsDay Our Lady of Fatima, turn your gaze towards us, towards our families, our country, and the world. Your response to Jesus cannot be conditioned by momentary calculations and convenience. It must be a life-long \u201cyes\u201d. We begin building peace in our homes, streets, and workplaces: wherever we craft communion and community. The Ascension of the Risen Jesus contains the promise that we too will participate in the fullness of life with God. We are Christians to the extent that we allow Jesus Christ to live in us. Our Lady Queen of the Rosary, pray that Jesus may have mercy on us sinners. Convert our hearts, Lord, so that love may spread here on earth. How wonderful to be \u201cenvoys of hope\u201d, simple and joyful messengers of the Easter acclamation. Every insult, injury or act of violence inflicted upon our neighbour, offends God our Father and Creator. Joyfully performing works of charity for those who are suffering in mind and body, is the most authentic way to live the Gospel. In the Cross, Jesus showed us the greatness of His love and the power of His mercy. Praying means being with God, experiencing God, loving God. Today, at the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Divine Love, as we recite the Rosary, we pray especially for peace in Syria and throughout the world. I invite you to pray the Rosary for peace during the entire month of May. We celebrate St Joseph the Worker, never forgetting that work is a fundamental aspect of human dignity. Be one with Christ when you pray, take care of your most vulnerable brothers and sisters, and work for peace. Do we really want peace? Then let\u2019s ban all weapons so we don\u2019t have to live in fear of war. I am deeply moved by the death of little Alfie. Today I pray especially for his parents, as God the Father receives him in his tender embrace. The Lord Jesus communicates His love for us, so that we can love God and our neighbor as He has loved us, by giving His life for us. When we are open to God\u2019s grace, even the impossible becomes possible. God alone can give us true happiness. It's useless wasting time looking for it elsewhere: in wealth, pleasure, and power. Authentic Christians are not afraid of opening up to others, of sharing their living spaces and transforming them into places of solidarity. Life only fully makes sense when it is given as a gift. It becomes tasteless when it is lived for itself alone. Moved by the prayers and immense solidarity shown little Alfie Evans, I renew my appeal that the suffering of his parents may be heard and that their desire to seek new forms of treatment may be granted. The Word of God is the lamp with which we look to the future: its light allows us to read the signs of the times. Let us follow the example of St Francis of Assisi and take care of our common Home. God calls each one of us, and each call is a gift that should fill us with joy. When we are full of self-importance, we leave no space for God. So let us ask the Lord for a conversion of heart. All it takes to encounter God is to acknowledge that we are needy. And the key to that encounter lies in humbling ourselves. Today we recall the words of Don Tonino Bello: \"Works of charity are not enough, unless those works are done with charity\". Mercy opens the doors of the heart because it makes us feel like we are all children of one Father. The Christian vocation means being a brother or sister to everyone, especially if they are poor, and even if they are an enemy. God asks us little and gives us a lot. He asks us to open our hearts and to welcome Him and the most vulnerable of our brothers and sisters. Those who protect children are on God\u2019s side and triumph over those who oppress them. Let us free every child from every form of exploitation. While I continue to pray unceasingly for peace, and invite all people of good will to do the same, I renew my appeal to all those with political responsibilities to ensure that justice and peace prevail. The Church is young because the Gospel is its lifeblood and regenerates it constantly. We are all called to be holy by living our lives with love and by bearing witness in everything we do. #GaudeteetExsultate The holiness to which the Lord calls you grows through small gestures in everyday life. #GaudeteetExsultate Saints are distinguished by a spirit of prayer and a need for communion with God. There is no holiness without prayer. #Holiness Holiness is the most attractive face of the Church. #SaintsToday The word \"happy\" or \"blessed\" becomes a synonym for \"holy\", because those faithful to God, by their self-giving, gain true happiness. #GaudeteetExsultate Keeping a heart free of all that tarnishes love, sowing peace all around us, accepting daily the path of the Gospel, even though it may cause us problems: that is holiness. #SaintsToday Being poor of heart, reacting with meekness and humility, knowing how to mourn with others, hungering and thirsting for righteousness, seeing and acting with mercy: that is holiness. #SaintsToday Are you in a position of authority? Be holy by working for the common good and renouncing personal gain. #GaudeteetExsultate Are you a parent or grandparent? Be holy by patiently teaching the little ones how to follow Jesus. #SaintsToday Do you work for a living? Be holy by labouring with integrity and skill in the service of your brothers and sisters. #Holiness Are you married? Be holy by loving and caring for your husband or wife, as Christ does for the Church. #GaudeteetExsultate Are you called to the consecrated life?  Be holy by living out your commitment with joy. #SaintsToday The Lord calls each of us to holiness, you too. #Holiness I wish to repropose the call to holiness: \u201cRejoice and be glad\u201d. #GaudeteetExsultate https://t.co/cZxmUGpMW7 Today God is still searching for hearts like Mary's, hearts that are ready to trust in Him completely. God covers us with His mercy, He enfolds us in Christ, so that we can become instruments of His goodness. Like the Good Samaritan, let us take care of those who are sick and suffering! #WorldHealthDay The Word of God is a light in the darkness: it helps us face our difficulties without fear. Let us go forward with the joy of Jesus' Resurrection, knowing He is always by our side! It is my sincere hope that everything necessary may be done in order to continue compassionately accompanying little Alfie Evans, and that the deep suffering of his parents may be heard.  I am praying for Alfie, for his family and for all who are involved. Love is the only invincible weapon, because it has the power to disarm the forces of evil. May Christ who conquered the darkness of sin and death, grant us peace in our days. As we contemplate Christ\u2019s empty tomb, let us renew our belief that nothing is lost with Him! Today we repeat that wondrous proclamation: \u201cThe Lord is truly risen, as He said!\u201d. A Blessed Easter to you all! Our faith is born on Easter morning: Jesus is alive! This experience is at the heart of the Christian message. Look upon Christ Crucified: our hope for eternal life is born in Him. Through the Eucharist we enter Christ\u2019s paschal mystery, allowing us to pass from death to life with Him. Anyone who turns away from the Cross, turns away from the Resurrection. Jesus changes our sins into forgiveness and our fears into trust. In His Cross our hope is reborn again and again. Christ, teach us never to be ashamed of your Cross! Please, let us fight together against the crime of human exploitation, which continues to cause unspeakable suffering. Dear young people, never get tired of being instruments of peace and joy among your peers! We enter this Holy Week with the Lord Jesus in order to celebrate Easter with hearts that are renewed by the grace of the Holy Spirit. The Word of God invites us to connect our ears to our hearts, and our hearts to our hands, in order to do good deeds. Now is the time to be reconciled with God. Staying on the path of evil is only a source of sadness. To defend the earth and to safeguard water is to protect life. Nobody can be discarded, because we are all vulnerable. Each one of us is a treasure whom God allows to grow in his or her own way. #Downsyndrome, #WDSD18 Dear fathers, happy Feast of St. Joseph! Follow his example when caring for your children as they grow up in wisdom and grace. As we listen to the aspirations of young people, may we catch a glimpse of the world that lies ahead, and of the roads the Church is called to travel. #Synod2018 Jesus made Himself like the grain of wheat that falls to the ground and dies to give life. Our hope springs from that love-filled life. Lent is the road that leads from slavery to freedom, from suffering to joy, from death to life. In order to prepare a truly human future, it is not enough to reject evil. We must build the common good together. If we encounter Jesus and our brothers and sisters every day, our hearts will not dwell in the past or the future. They will live in God's present moment, in peace with everyone. When we allow Jesus to enter our lives we discover the secret to keeping alive the flame of our spiritual life. Living the encounter with Jesus means allowing yourself to be turned inside out by Grace every day. What would happen to us if God did not always give us the chance to start over again? If we dedicate more time to prayer, our hearts will reveal the lies with which we deceive ourselves, and we will find true consolation in God. In the Sacrament of Reconciliation we find our way back to the Lord, and rediscover the meaning of life. With so much to do, we often neglect what is really important: our spiritual lives, and our relationship with God. So let's stop and take time to pray! I thank all women who every day strive to build more humane and welcoming societies. If sometimes the flame of charity seems to die in our hearts, it never dies in the heart of God! Let us learn to recognize that which leaves a good and lasting mark on our hearts, knowing that it comes from God. God, who cannot be outdone in generosity, still uses you and me to help our brothers and sisters. When you meet other people in the Lord, you can be sure God\u2019s surprises will follow. Almsgiving helps us to recognize our neighbour as our brother or sister, and to acknowledge that what we possess is never our's alone. Fasting makes us more alert and attentive to God and our neighbour, and reminds us that He alone can satisfy our hunger. God in His providence offers us the season of Lent each year as a chance to return to Him with all our hearts and in every aspect of our lives. We can support one another, and face every kind of challenge with courage and hope, when we draw our strength from Jesus. We are all called to live the joy that comes from the encounter with Jesus, to overcome our selfishness, and to move beyond our comfort zone. If we want a future of prosperity for all, we need to keep our compass pointing toward \u201ctrue North\u201d, in the direction of authentic values. Let us invoke the gift of peace for the whole world, especially for those people who are suffering most because of ongoing conflicts. We offer a gift pleasing to Jesus when we spend time with a person who has difficulties or we help someone for the sake of helping. Our Heavenly Father always listens to His children when they cry out to Him in their pain. Today let us offer the Lord a Day of prayer and fasting for peace. I wish you all a fruitful Lenten journey, and I ask you to pray for me and my collaborators as we begin our week of Spiritual Exercises. Only those able to acknowledge their mistakes and ask pardon receive understanding and forgiveness from others. The message of Jesus is troubling and disturbs us because it challenges worldly religious power and stirs consciences. In our daily lives we experience the tenderness of God who lovingly saves us from our sins, fears and anxieties. When we confess our sins with humility and sincerity, we receive forgiveness and are reunited with God and our brothers and sisters. We need the Holy Spirit to transmit the faith. We cannot do it alone. I feel deep pain for the many children torn from their families and forced to become child soldiers. This is a tragedy! To serve human life is to serve God and life at every stage: from the womb of the mother, to the suffering and sickness of old age. May the sick always be shown love in their fragility and respected in their inviolable dignity. The Lord is present in our lives, showing us all His love and encouraging us to respond with generosity. Christians are called to keep alive the memory of how much God has done through them. We cannot remain silent before the suffering of millions of people whose dignity has been wounded. Let us welcome victims of human trafficking, and all those fleeing from war and hunger, with a compassionate heart. As we grow in our spiritual lives, we realize how Grace comes to us and to others, and must be shared with everyone. All of us are called to commit ourselves to protecting minors in the digital world. One who is aware of his own wretchedness and lowers his gaze with humility feels God\u2019s merciful gaze set upon him. Jesus wants to be found by those who look for Him. But to look for Him we have to get up and go out. A life of faith means wanting to be with the Lord, and that means constantly searching for Him wherever He is. May every person come to Christ, the Light of Truth, and may the world advance along the path of justice and peace. A faith that does not trouble us is a troubled faith. A faith that does not make us grow is a faith that needs to grow. Jesus is our mediator, who reconciles us not only with the Father but also with each other. Goodness, together with love, justice and solidarity, are not achieved once and for all; they have to be realized each day. Through prayer we can enter into a stable relationship with God, the source of true joy. I pray for those who suffer from Hansen\u2019s Disease and I encourage those who are committed to their care and reintegration into society. Here we are, Lord, ashamed of what humanity, made in your image and likeness, is capable of doing. Remember us in your mercy. Christian joy cannot be bought. It comes from faith and from meeting Jesus Christ, who is the reason for our happiness. Prayer allows us to see one another the way God our Father sees us, and to realize that we are brothers and sisters. I would like to invite everyone to promote a journalism of peace, a journalism created by people for people. The most radical antidote to the virus of falsehood is purification by the truth. There is no such thing as harmless disinformation; trusting in falsehood can have dire consequences. Prayer that purifies, strengthens and illuminates our path is like fuel for our journey towards full Christian unity. I am grateful to all who have accompanied me on my pilgrimage to Chile and Peru in so many ways, especially with prayer. The Lord calls you today to travel with Him through the city, your city. He calls you to be His missionary disciple. Don't waste time hiding your heart. Fill your life with the Holy Spirit! There is no better medicine to heal so many wounds than a heart capable of mercy. Praise to you, Lord, for this wonderful creation that is the Amazon people, and for all the biodiversity these lands contain! Every life counts: from the beginning to the end, from conception to natural death The Gospel message is a source of joy: a joy that spreads from generation to generation and which we inherit. Listening to religious teaching or learning a doctrine is not enough. What we want is to live as Jesus lived. We pray to God for the courage to ask forgiveness and to learn how to listen to what he is saying to us. I ask you to accompany me on my journey to Chile and Peru in your prayers. We should work to accommodate, to protect, to promote and to integrate whoever is forced to leave their own home and undergo moments of real difficulty. @M_RSection We must not wait to be perfect before responding to the Lord who calls us, but rather open our hearts to His voice. The encounter with God and our brothers and sisters cannot wait just because we are slow or lazy. We are called to that encounter today! If we fail to suffer with those who suffer, even those of different religions, languages or cultures, we need to question our own humanity. The more we are rooted in Christ, the more we rediscover interior peace, even in the midst of daily challenges. A joyful soul is like healthy soil in which life can thrive and produce good fruit. Joy, prayer and gratitude are three ways that help us live authentically. Let us share the joy of our Christian brothers and sisters of the East who are celebrating Christmas today. Baptism is also called \u2018illumination\u2019, because faith illuminates the heart and allows us to see things in a different light. Like the Magi, believers are led by faith to seek God in the most hidden places, knowing that the Lord waits for them there. God walks along the dusty paths of our lives and responds to our longing for love and happiness by calling us to joy. God became a child to be closer to the men and women of every time, and to show us His infinite tenderness. In the name of Jesus, with our witness, we can prove that peace is possible. In the simplicity of the nativity scene we encounter and contemplate the tenderness of God which reveals itself in the Baby Jesus. Let us nurture the seeds of peace as they grow and let us transform our cities into workshops of peace. The Family is the harmonious union of differences between a man and a woman. When it\u2019s open to life and to others it\u2019s even more authentic. During these days let us give space to attitudes and gestures that favour peace. Modesty is a virtue that is essential for anyone who wants to be like Jesus, who is meek and humble of heart. Today we pray for all the children who are not allowed to be born, who cry with hunger, who hold weapons in their hands instead of toys. God is in love with us. He draws us to Him with tenderness by being born poor and fragile among us, like one of us. Today we want to remember all those who suffer persecution. We want to be close to them with our affection and our prayers. Stop and look at the nativity scene: let us enter the true spirit of Christmas with the shepherds, bringing Baby Jesus all that we are. Contemplating the Baby Jesus, with His humble and infinite love, let us say to Him, very simply: \u201cThank you for doing all this for me!\u201d If we really want to celebrate Christmas, let\u2019s contemplate this image: the fragile simplicity of a new-born baby. That\u2019s where God is. Let us free Christmas from the worldliness that has taken it hostage! The true spirit of Christmas is the beauty of being loved by God. Without love, both life and faith are worthless. Heaven doesn\u2019t value what you have, but what you give. Go out to meet Jesus, spend time with Him in prayer, and entrust your whole life to His merciful love. Every stranger that knocks at our door is an opportunity to meet Jesus Christ. May the Lord grant us the wisdom to seek that which is worthwhile and to love, not with our words but with our actions. We become holy when we work for others. When we do so, we continue the creative action of God in history. Even if there were no one else left to remember us, Jesus would always be there at our side. I encourage all of you to live the joy of your mission by witnessing to the Gospel wherever you are called to live and work. Christians are called to work concretely in the realities of this world, illuminating them with the light that comes from God. Thank you for following @Pontifex which turns five years old today. May social media always be spaces that are rich in humanity! We ask for the grace to make our faith more and more operative through acts of charity. Political activity must truly be conducted at the service of the human person, with respect for creation and for the common good. We must fight corruption with determination. It is an evil based on the worship of money and it offends human dignity. May the Virgin Mary always be our refuge, our consolation, and the way that leads to Christ. We all possess God-given talents. No one can claim to be so poor that they have nothing to offer others. No child of God can be discarded in His eyes. He entrusts a mission to each one of us. We are all beggars before the love of God, a love that gives meaning to our existence and that offers us eternal life. Faith becomes tangible when it finds its expression in love and, especially, in the service of our brothers and sisters in difficulty. Every person is unique and unrepeatable. Let us ensure the disabled are always welcomed by the communities in which they live. Dear friends in Myanmar and Bangladesh, thank you for your welcome! Upon you I invoke divine blessings of harmony and peace. May the wisdom of God help us to know how to welcome and accept those who think and act differently from us. How much openness is needed to welcome people who feel alone and confused as they search for a meaning in life! The most holy name of God can never be invoked to justify hatred and violence against other human beings. The love of Christ is like a \u201cspiritual GPS\u201d that guides us unerringly towards God and towards the heart of our neighbor. I want my visit to embrace all the people of Myanmar and to encourage the building of an inclusive society. Let us look to Jesus today and say to Him in our hearts: \"Remember me, Lord, now that you are in your Kingdom!\" As I prepare to visit Myanmar and Bangladesh, I wish to send a message of greeting and friendship to everyone. I can't wait to meet you! There is also hope for those who have done wrong. Jesus came for this: it is possible to be reconciled with God and begin a new life. At the end of time, when the Lord comes to meet us, our joy will be immense. We live in anticipation of this encounter! When we encounter others, do we bring them the warmth of charity or do we stay closed up and warm only ourselves before our fireplace? May Mary's pure and simple smile be a source of joy for each one of us as we face life\u2019s difficulties. Let us work together to ensure that children continue to smile: their faces serene, filled with joy and hope. #WorldChildrensDay On this day, I invite the entire Church to keep its gaze fixed on those who hold out their hands asking for our solidarity. Without the support of the prayers of the faithful, the Successor of Peter cannot fulfill his mission in the world. I am counting on you too! We need to encounter the poor and learn how to share so that it becomes a way of life. Poverty is not an accident. It has causes that must be recognized and removed for the good of so many of our brothers and sisters. Faith is a great life companion, allowing us to feel the presence of a Father who never leaves His creatures alone. Nothing and nobody can block the light that Christ puts in our hearts and on the face of His friends. A Christian can never be a pessimist! We cannot change the world alone, but together we can spread the joy of the Gospel by staying close to those most in need. Let us remember in our prayers all those who, with dedication and spirit of sacrifice, care for those who are ill. Science expresses its full dignity when it serves the integral development of the person and the human family. May a culture of encounter always be promoted that is able to bring down the walls which still divide the world. Only faith can transform the end of our earthly life into the beginning of eternal life. Jesus of Nazareth walks at our side and introduces us, by his words and the signs he performs, to the great mystery of the Father\u2019s love. War always causes serious damage to the environment. We must not mistreat our common home, but take care of it for future generations. Christ was victorious over death. He is our resurrection and our life. Be witnesses to this message of hope. The Church needs faithful people who proclaim the Gospel with enthusiasm and wisdom, instilling hope and faith. When we pray, we need to have the courage of faith. Have trust that the Lord hears us! We are all small and defenceless before the mystery of death, but what a grace if at that moment we keep in our heart the flame of faith! Dear friends, the world needs saints and we are all called to holiness without exception. Don\u2019t be afraid! May the Virgin Mary help us to take the first step each day in order to build peace in love, justice and truth. Learn from wonder; nurture astonishment. Live, love, believe. And, with the grace of God, never despair. I invite you to keep your eyes fixed on Jesus Christ in order to learn from Him how to love with all your heart. Remember the sufferings of every person in your heart. Then bring them all to God in your prayers. God loves us with a love so rich in mercy that He constantly welcomes us, protects and forgives us. The culture of encounter means recognizing that we are all children of God, despite our differences. Be courageous witnesses to Christ in the places where you live and work. Let us all work together to promote peace among peoples and guarantee respect for human rights. Jesus gave us the light which shines in the darkness. Defend and protect this light: it is the greatest treasure entrusted to you. Today, as we remember Saint John Paul II, let us also recall his words: \u201cDo not be afraid! Open wide the doors for Christ!\u201d On this day, let us remember that the Church is missionary by nature: mission is at the heart of Christian faith. #Missio The Church is truly alive if it is maternal and missionary and goes out to meet others. Let us bring the flame of Christ\u2019s love to humanity which needs true happiness and peace so much. Let yourself be guided by the tenderness of God so that you may transform the world with your faith. May artists spread the beauty of the faith and proclaim the grandeur of God\u2019s creation and His boundless love for all. It is the duty of the human family to help free every single person from poverty and hunger. Sharing requires conversion, and this is a challenge. #ZeroHunger Ensuring everyone\u2019s right to food and nourishment is an imperative we cannot ignore. It is a right to which there are no exceptions! Along with the Saints, let the joy and beauty of living the Gospel shine through the witness of our lives. We are called to defend and safeguard human life, especially in the mother\u2019s womb, in infancy, old age and physical or mental disability. In this centenary of the apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima, we thank God for the countless blessings we have received under her protection. The statue of Our Lady of Aparecida was found by poor workers. May Mary bless all of us, but especially those seeking employment. Like Saint John XXIII, whom we remember today, let us witness to God\u2019s goodness and mercy before the Church and the world. God does not disappoint! He has placed hope in our hearts so that it can blossom and bear fruit. The search for peace is an open-ended task, a responsibility that never ends and that demands the commitment of everyone. When you experience bitterness, put your faith in all those who still work for good: in their humility lies the seed of a new world. The Rosary is a synthesis of the mysteries of Christ: we contemplate them with Mary, who allows us to see with her eyes of faith and love. Let us ensure that the Internet is a safe and richly human place for children: a network that does not entrap them but helps them to grow. The mission of schools and teachers is to develop an understanding of all that is true, good and beautiful. Like Saint Francis of Assisi, let us be transformed by the love of Christ in order to live in simplicity and joy. Only in the silence of prayer can you learn to listen to the voice of God. Our guardian angel is a friend we do not see, but whose presence we feel. He accompanies us on our earthly journey to heaven. Like Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus, let us learn from the humility of God who became small for us. In our times we need to pray so much \u2013 Christians, Jews, and Muslims \u2013 for peace. I have chosen this theme for World Communications Day 2018: \u201cThe truth will set you free\u201d (Jn 8:32). Fake news and journalism for peace. Today is the Feast of the Archangels Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael. Let us call on them so that we are always reminded of God\u2019s presence. Encountering Jesus can give a decisive direction to our life, filling it with meaning. #ShareJourney https://t.co/cV9MN3PjeV Let us share without fear the journey of migrants and refugees. #ShareJourney Let us commit ourselves to a world without nuclear weapons by implementing the Non-Proliferation Treaty to abolish these weapons of death. Charity is more authentic and incisive when it is lived in communion. Joy multiplies when you share it! If we are faithful to Christ and do good works, we can spread the light of God\u2019s hope. The Gospel invites us first of all to answer to God, who loves us and saves us, and to recognize Him in our neighbor. I appeal for peace and disarmament: in this world wounded by violence, we need fraternity among peoples. Hope is the virtue of a heart that does not close itself in darkness or remain locked in the past, but looks towards the future. Let us work together to find concrete solutions to help the poor, refugees, victims of modern forms of slavery, in order to promote peace. Let us find the courage to purify our hearts by removing the rocks and thorns which choke the Word of God. The more Jesus occupies the centre of our lives, the more He allows us to come out of ourselves and brings us closer to others. Global action is needed in order to reduce pollution and at the same time promote development in poorer countries. The Lord does not leave us orphans: we have a Mother, the same one as Jesus. Mary takes care of us and always defends us. In the Cross our hope is reborn. Hope born of the Cross is different from that of the world, because it is born of the love of Jesus. War is the negation of all rights. Let us pray for those who have the responsibility to avoid war between peoples. I encourage world leaders to set aside partisan and ideological interests and seek together the common good of all humanity. Dear Colombian brothers and sisters, thank you! I have met so many people who have touched my heart. You have done me a world of good! To \u201ctake the first step\u201d is, above all, to go out and meet others with Christ the Lord. Charity helps us to know the truth and truth calls for acts of kindness. Our contagious joy must be our first testimony to the closeness and love of God. Today there are many who hunger for God, who hunger for dignity. As Christians, we must help them to be satiated by God. Truth is an inseparable companion of justice and mercy. Reconciliation is consolidated by the contribution of all. It enables us to build the future and makes hope grow. Dear young people, do not be afraid of the future! Dare to dream big! Keep joy alive, a sign of a young heart that has encountered the Lord. I encourage you to entrust yourselves to the Lord, who is the only one who helps and inspires us to contribute to reconciliation and peace. Dear Friends, please pray for me and all of Colombia, where I will be travelling for a journey dedicated to reconciliation and peace. Like Mother Teresa, may we open up opportunities of joy and hope for the many who are discouraged and need understanding and tenderness. Jesus is present in so many of our brothers and sisters who suffer today like He did. It is much more important to realize how much God loves us, than how much we ourselves love Him. Jesus is always there with an open heart. He throws open the mercy that he has in his heart. He forgives, embraces, and understands. Lord, teach us to contemplate you in the beauty of creation and reawaken our gratitude and sense of responsibility. If you pay attention to the heart, you will find you are close to the Lord and to others. The Gospel invites us to answer first and foremost to God who loves us and saves us, recognising Him in our neighbour. \u201cYou made us unto Yourself, and our heart is restless until it rests in you\u201d. (St Augustine\u2019s \u201cConfessions\u201d) Today how many mothers shed tears, like St Monica, so that their children will return to Christ! Do not lose hope in God\u2019s grace! May the Virgin Mary obtain for us the grace to be enlivened by the Holy Spirit, so we can witness to Christ with evangelical honesty. Being men and women of the Church means being men and women of communion. Humanity needs hope in order to live and needs the Holy Spirit in order to hope. The Lord is close to all those who are victims of old and new forms of slavery: inhuman labour, illegal trafficking and exploitation. When we are feeling sad, when it feels like everything is going wrong, we should remember: \u201cGod loves me. God never abandons me\u201d. May the Holy Spirit grant peace to the whole world and heal the wounds of war and terrorism. We always need to rediscover God\u2019s love and mercy in order to develop our relationship with Him. I pray for all the victims of the attacks of these days. May the blind violence of terrorism no longer find room to exist in this world! May nothing stop you from living and growing in your Heavenly Father\u2019s friendship, and from witnessing to His infinite goodness and mercy. Mary\u2019s Assumption regards our future: it turns our gaze heavenward announcing the new heaven and new earth with Christ\u2019s victory. The journey of entrusting ourselves to the Lord begins every day, starting each morning. In Mary we see that humility is not a virtue of the weak but of the strong who don\u2019t have to treat others badly to feel important. Dear young people, you are the hope of the Church. Do you dream about your future? Then take part in #synod18! https://t.co/XNDm29yp3s When something makes us suffer, let us listen to the voice of Jesus in our hearts: \u201cDo not fear! Go ahead! I am with you!\u201d Jesus does not leave us alone because we are precious to Him. In witnessing to the faith what counts is not success, but fidelity to Christ. Today we give glory to God for the work of Saint Dominic in the service of the Gospel which he preached with his words and his life. Forgiveness sets our hearts free and allows us to start anew.\u00a0 Forgiveness gives hope. Without forgiveness, the Church is not built up. Hope is the virtue of a heart that doesn't lock itself into darkness, that doesn't dwell on the past, but is able to see a tomorrow. Other people are gifts to be received with respect, especially if they are weak and frail, because Christ comes to meet us in them. In the name of Jesus we can make known, through our witness, that peace is possible! The Gospel is Good News filled with contagious joy, for it contains and offers new life. We effectively do good when we do it without seeking reward and in the concrete situations of everyday life. Like Saint Ignatius of Loyola, let us be won over by the Lord Jesus and, led by Him, place ourselves at the service of others. We call on all people of faith and good will to take action and oppose modern slavery in all its forms. I entrust little Charlie to the Father and pray for his parents and all those who loved him. How important grandparents are for family life, for passing on the human and religious heritage so essential for each and every society! When we need help, let us turn to the Father who always looks on us with love and never abandons us. We must overcome all forms of racism, of intolerance and of the instrumentalization of the human person. Let us be led by the Virgin Mary on the path that leads to the holy mountain that is Christ, where God and man meet. Europe has a unique patrimony of ideals and spiritual values, one that deserves to be proposed again with passion and renewed vigour. I entrust sailors, fishermen, and all those in difficulty on the seas faraway from home, to the motherly protection of Mary, Star of the Sea Migrants are our brothers and sisters in search of a better life, far away from poverty, hunger, and war. How beautiful it is to see when young people are \u201cstreet preachers\u201d, joyfully bringing Jesus to every street and every corner of the earth! A Christian\u2019s mission in the world is splendid, it is a mission intended for everyone, it is a mission of service, excluding no one! To defend human life, above all when it is wounded by illness, is a duty of love that God entrusts to all. There is great need to feed Christian hope, which gives us a new view capable of discovering and seeing the good. May we entrust ourselves to the intercession of Sts Peter and Paul in order to give witness to God\u2019s liberating action on us. God looks with love upon every one of us. Sharpen your gaze in order to see the signs God shows us in reality. I repeat the firm condemnation of every form of torture and call on everyone to work for its abolishment and support victims and families. Each one of us is precious; each one of us is irreplaceable in God\u2019s eyes. Mercy warms the heart and makes it sensitive to the needs of brothers and sisters with sharing and participation. Go forth and reach out to all people at the margins of society! Go there and be the Church, with the strength of the Holy Spirit. Let us not be distracted by the false wisdom of this world, but to follow Jesus as the one sure guide who gives meaning to our life. We must not turn our backs on the new forms of poverty and marginalization that prevent people from living a life of dignity. The personal encounter with refugees dispels fears and distorted ideologies and becomes a factor for growth in humanity. @M_RSection None of us is an island, autonomous and independent from others. We can only build the future by standing together, including everyone. Jesus was broken; he is broken for us. This is the Eucharist. And he asks us to give ourselves, to break ourselves, as it were, for others. Care for the environment is always a social concern as well. Let us hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor. Love requires a creative, concrete response. Good intentions are not enough. The other is not a statistic, but a person to take care of. Everyone's existence is tied to that of others: life is not time merely passing by, life is about interactions. There is much need of prayer and penitence to implore the grace of conversion and an end to the many wars throughout the world. In his passion, Jesus took upon himself all our suffering. He knows the meaning of pain, he understands and comforts us, giving us strength. The Church shines forth when she is missionary, welcoming, free, faithful, poor in means and rich in love. The Feast of the Most Holy Trinity invites us to be a leaven of communion, consolation and mercy. Life can survive only because of the generosity of other lives. Each one of us, as a living member of the Body of Christ, is called to work for unity and peace. Humility and tenderness are not virtues of the weak, but of the strong. The Church needs everyday saints, those of ordinary life carried out with coherence. Let\u2019s always remember that our faith is concrete: the Word became flesh, not an idea! We must never forget that the natural environment is a collective good, the patrimony of all humanity and the responsibility of everyone. Let us allow ourselves to be humbly led by the Holy Spirit in order to avoid taking the wrong road and closing our hearts. Let us promote with courage all necessary means to protect the lives of our children. Through the darkness of today's conflicts, every one of us can become a bright candle, a reminder that light will overcome darkness. I thank God for parents who strive to live in love and keep moving forward, even if they fall many times along the way. Let us learn from the strong and helpful faith of our Mother Mary in order to become living signs of God\u2019s mercy. Christian joy comes from the Holy Spirit, who gives us true freedom and the gift of bringing Jesus to our brothers and sisters. The motherly presence of Mary reminds us that God never tires of lowering himself in mercy over humanity. I encourage everyone to engage in constructive forms of communication that reject prejudice towards others and foster hope and trust today. Let us pray for our Coptic brethren in Egypt who were killed because they did not want to renounce the faith. The future of our societies requires concrete action in favor of life on the part of everyone and especially institutions. With the Ascension of Jesus, we participate in the fullness of life with God. Let us carry this in our hearts in our daily lives. Let us pray with Catholics in China, entrusting ourselves to Mary, for the grace to endure patiently and overcome challenges with love. \u8b93\u6211\u5011\u8207\u4e2d\u570b\u5929\u4e3b\u6559\u5f92\u4e00\u540c\u7948\u79b1\uff0c\u5c07\u6211\u5011\u8a17\u4ed8\u65bc\u8056\u6bcd\u746a\u5229\u4e9e\uff0c\u597d\u4f7f\u6211\u5011\u6709\u8db3\u5920\u7684\u6069\u5bf5\u85c9\u8457\u8010\u5fc3\u548c\u611b\u53bb\u514b\u670d\u4e00\u5207\u56f0\u96e3\u3002 Dialogue allows us to plan for a future in common. Through dialogue we build peace, taking care of everyone. We are called to live not as one without others, above or against others, but with and for others. Mary teaches us to place our hope in God even when all seems without meaning, even when He seems hidden. Peace must be built on justice, on integral human development, on respect for human rights, on the protection of creation. Let us seek to always hold high the \u201ctone\u201d of our life, remembering the goal and glory for which we exist, work, struggle and suffer. God makes His most beautiful flowers grow among the driest stones. Our hope is the Lord Jesus whom we recognize as living and present in us and in our brothers and sisters. Jesus asks to be looked in the eye, to be acknowledged, to be loved. Let us ask for the grace to follow Jesus faithfully, not in words but in deeds, and to have the patience to carry our own cross. Let us all ask for the gift to understand God\u2019s word. Fatima is more than anything this mantle of Light where we take refuge when we ask the Virgin Mary: \u201cshow unto us Jesus\u201d. Whenever we look to Mary, we come to believe once again in the revolutionary nature of love and tenderness. Here in Fatima, I give praise to Christ, our peace, and I implore for the world \u00a0concord among all peoples. I ask everyone to join me as pilgrims of hope and peace: may your hands in prayer continue to support mine. With Mary, as a pilgrim of hope and peace I travel to Fatima tomorrow.Let us see in her that everything is God\u2019s gift and He is our strength God is greater than nothingness, and a lit candle is enough to overcome the darkest of nights. Everyone has something to give to society; no one is excluded from contributing to the good of all. May Jesus, who vanquished the darkness of sin and death, grant peace to our days. Let us be challenged by the words and actions of Jesus, and welcome his call to a life that is fully human, happy to spend itself in love. Rejoice! Hidden within your life is a seed of resurrection, an offer of life ready to be awakened! In every age, the Risen Christ tirelessly seeks us, his brothers and sisters, wandering in the deserts of this world. Let us allow ourselves to be surprised by the newness that Christ alone can give. May his tenderness and love guide our steps. May our attitude be gentle and humble, attentive to caring for the poor. Let\u2019s work together to increase solidarity and sharing. Cooperation helps to build better and more peaceful societies. May Saint Joseph give young people the ability to dream, to take risks for big tasks, the things that God dreams for us. By his resurrection, Jesus Christ has set us free from the slavery of sin and death, and has opened before us the way to eternal life. The presence of Jesus can be communicated through our lives and the language of gratuitous and concrete love. May the Lord today grant us to set out together as pilgrims of communion and messengers of peace. We are called to walk together, in the conviction that the future also depends on the encounter of religions and cultures. Please pray for my journey tomorrow as a pilgrim of peace to Egypt. Let\u2019s promote friendship and respect between men and women of different religious traditions in order to build a world of peace. He died, He was buried, He rose and He appeared. Jesus is alive! This is the heart of the Christian message. If we had God\u2019s Word always in our heart, no temptation could separate us from God. Let us pray for the grace to never grow tired of drawing from the well of the Father\u2019s mercy and bringing it to the world. God\u2019s mercy is forever; it never ends, it never runs out, it never gives up when faced with closed doors, and it never tires. Lord, bring healing to our lives, that we may protect the world and not prey on it, that we may sow beauty, not pollution and destruction. When we have reached the lowest point of our misery and our weakness, the Risen Christ gives us the strength to rise again. Since Christ is resurrected, we can look with new eyes and a new heart at every event of our lives, even the most negative ones. Let us meditate with wonder and gratitude on the great mystery of the Lord\u2019s Resurrection. During this week of Easter it would do us good every day to read a passage from the Gospel which speaks of the Resurrection of Christ. Yes, we are sure of it: Christ indeed from death is risen! Happy Easter! May you bring to all the joy and hope of the Risen Christ! https://t.co/SB50xA3Gp5 Today is the celebration of our hope, the celebration of this truth: nothing and no one will ever be able to separate us from God\u2019s love. O Cross of Christ, teach us that the rising of the sun is more powerful than the darkness of night, and God's eternal love wins always. https://t.co/FY2I0JKCeo It is good for us to break out of our set ways, because it is proper to the Heart of God to overflow with tenderness, with ever more to give While the mystery of evil is profound, the reality of God\u2019s Love poured out through Jesus is infinite and victorious. Jesus comes to save us; we are called to choose his way: the way of service, of giving, of forgetfulness of ourselves. During this Holy Week let us focus our gaze on Jesus and ask for the grace to better understand the mystery of his sacrifice for our sake. O Cross of Christ, inspire in us a desire for God, for goodness and for light. Dear young friends, don\u2019t be afraid to say \u201cyes\u201d to Jesus with all your heart, to respond generously and to follow him! Lent is a period of repentance aimed at enabling ourselves to rise with Christ, to renew our baptismal identity. Hope helps believers to be open to the surprises God has in store for us. Let us follow in the footsteps of Christ, especially by dedicating ourselves to our brothers and sisters in need. Today is the International Day of Mine Awareness. Let us please renew the commitment for a world without mines! Lent is, by nature, a time of hope because it leads us to be born anew \u201cof the spirit\u201d, by the love of God. When the Holy Spirit abides in our hearts, it is he who makes us understand that the Lord is near and takes care of us. Even in the hardest and most disturbing moments, the Lord\u2019s mercy and goodness are greater than every thing. Fasting with a proud heart does more harm than good. The first fast is for humility. Prayer is powerful. Prayer conquers evil. Prayer brings peace. The peace that springs from faith is a gift: it is the grace of feeling that God loves us and that he is always beside us.", "bag_of_tweets": ["May we not let this time of grace pass in vain, in the foolish illusion that we can control the times and means of our conversion to the Lord! #Lent", "How many times have we told the Lord: \u201cLord, I will come to you later...
