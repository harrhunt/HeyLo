So genius. @tesfayealeee Mother wants to talk to uuuuuuuu \ud83d\udc7b @homelypop Brooke hogan stan account..... I respect that. Ruff me up momma @Mellyz_melss I didn\u2019t love the 4th one (Hayden was amazing tho) and I haven\u2019t watched the show except the pilot. But I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s actually good! They shot it at my old high school which is kinda crazy haha @mckayjoe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/k9Nv2CPH9I @iamscottee I see what u mean totally. I think I loved it so much because it had so many emotional moments with Sydney dealing with the loss of her mom. It just really hit me. I loved the mix of emotion with horror in that one @mckayjoe This is very random but I love H20. I\u2019ve probably seen it 100 times haha @fadedsdmn When she walks into the movie set of her childhood home and sees her moms body bag get up and ask her for a hug. Emotional and horrifying :,) @kimblechee Omg yes! One of the best reveals for sure. I loveeeee the finale of part 2 @delissaaaa @mikeschains She was.... dying \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 @httpbrxck Which one? I\u2019ve probably seen all 3 like 200 times each? @delissaaaa @mikeschains Right*** oops I flopped @delissaaaa @mikeschains Are u..... thinking of the write movie?...... the theatre scene is one of the most iconic moments ever!! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d @mikeschains 2/2 scream 4 in all honesty I didn\u2019t love. I\u2019ve only watched it a couple times. I feel like the opening sequence got a little to meta for me. Loved Hayden tho. So I guess I\u2019d say scream 1,2,3 and then 4? Haha @mikeschains Omg. That\u2019s so hard..... hmmmm in all honesty I love them all for different reasons. Scream 1 is a classic and it\u2019s perfect. Scream 2 is fast moving and has amazing suspense scenes. Scream 3 has the movie set of Sydney\u2019s old house which gives me chills just thinking about it. 1/2 How does it feel to finally openly admit you love Scream 3 without fear of judgment? Does it feel good jooooo? Cause I know it feels good for me. https://t.co/hHyRXQreCj https://t.co/xVeCO6z6mE My name is Shane and I\u2019m a life long Scream fan... who also loves Scream 3.
