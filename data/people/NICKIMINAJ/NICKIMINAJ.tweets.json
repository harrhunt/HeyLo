Sending love to my sister @TRINArockstarr during this time of the devastating loss of her beloved mother. Pls lift her up. This is a very difficult time for her. RT @theestallion: Wow hot girl summer hit a million views in less than 5 hours keep running it up \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffd \ud83d\ude2d https://t.co/gVdxoMsRgl https://t.co/lZrrAc5DJH #HotGirlSummer RT @TheEllenShow: #HotGirlSummer https://t.co/XlyILmE76T But I first had to learn how to love MYSELF. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe if you wouldn\u2019t let a man treat your mother, your sister or best friend like that b/c you LOVE them, then you wouldn\u2019t let a man treat YOU like that b/c you love YOU. This isn\u2019t about judging. We judge too much. Lift them up. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe I remember being so afraid to speak cuz I never knew when that person would be in a particular mood and I could maybe say one wrong thing that would get me hit. So the diff you see in me now is that feeling when a woman feels lifted up, safe, appreciated &amp; unconditionally loved. I rlly used to think love had to hurt. So I could never look down on anyone else. We are merely human. It\u2019s not easy to leave. Especially in the world of IG where all ppl want to do is post relationship goal pics for clout &amp; attention. A man should make you feel safe, not afraid Dear all of you beautiful souls. \n\nA man who loves you does not: \n\n1. Humiliate you on social media\n2. Beat you \n3. Cheat on you \n4. Call you out of your name/put you down to lower your self esteem due to his own insecurities. \n5. Hide his phone, passwords, where abouts, etc. When u see a woman in a toxic relationship, rather than laugh &amp; say mean things, try to offer sound advice from your heart &amp; root for her to learn her worth. We\u2019ve all been there. I saw my parents fight &amp; argue non stop &amp; never divorce, so I thought this was normal behavior... That\u2019s a Makk Fakk https://t.co/HxcwKVYvgP Ok boos don\u2019t trend that dumb hashtag.

Nobody deserves to suffer in silence, no matter how BIG they are. Everyone ha\u2026 My music went up on Apple so I played it. I assumed it was on Spotify &amp; Tidal at the same time. Spotify said that Apple tweeted fans advising #Queen was up &amp; therefore they had to teach me a lesson. But PRAISE BE TO GOD!!!!!! Spotify had to teach me a lesson but rewarded the man who has had an Apple radio show the longest; inadvertently helping the Apple platform the most. Oh I can\u2019t wait for #QueenRadio on Tuesday. They took away my promotion they had promised for the 1st cpl days b/c of this. #Queen Spotify put drake\u2019s face on every playlist but told me they\u2019d have to teach me a lesson for playing my music 10 mins early on #QueenRadio.

That\u2019s the\u2026 I looked at the numbers the Carters, Kanye, Nas, etc recently did. Travis sold 200K in his first week of clothes alone. I spoke to him last night &amp; he said he\u2019s been selling clothes b4 the music. Billboard says they\u2019ll change the rules cuz of this, so it should be changed now! My first album sold 400K. No one is doing that with debut albums now. So I\u2019m so grateful. I lost out on 12 hours of sales and did 200K in one week after I was supposedly cancelled. I bit my tongue last #QueenRadio but I won\u2019t On Tuesday. I love you guys so much Travis sold over 50K of these. With no requirement of redeeming the album! With no dates for a tour, etc. I spoke to him. He knows he doesn\u2019t have the #1 album this week. I love my fans for the #1 album in AMERICA!
