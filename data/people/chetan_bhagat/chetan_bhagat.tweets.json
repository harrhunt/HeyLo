This is the song I quote these days when I find people wasting their time on useless things and attacking me when I tell them not to. This is a remix, but yes.

Let\u2019s keep the focus on that rather than never ending, divisive and pointless agendas. Attacking and bullying a job creating business for spreading a unifying and positive message? Definitely yes! https://t.co/5ZPejpW6mh Dear #tanishq, most people attacking you can\u2019t afford you anyway.\nAnd given where their thinking will take this economy, they soon won\u2019t have jobs and hence definitely won\u2019t able to buy anything from #tanishq in the future too. Don\u2019t worry about them. I don't feel bad when people don't call me to a party, Bollywood or any other.\n\nI feel, what a boring party it would be without me.\n\nIt's all about how to think.\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\ude02\n\nStay your own favorite. @SoulfulBharti c'mon. how can u hate on anything with Arijit in it? To all conspiracy theorists (he writes this because...)\n\n1. My Bollywood income is less than 5% of my total income\n2. I am not even keen on Bollywood adaptations, digital platforms excite me a lot more now.\n\nI speak freely.Maybe you speak based on who you have to suck up to. Sad. Anyone who condemns Bollywood has not heard Arijit Singh songs. Or any of the other past great singers. Generations of young Indians have fallen in love or healed their heartbreak with Bollywood music. For this alone, Bollywood is one of the most wonderful Indian things. As a TATA group company, expected #Tanishq to be fairer and braver. If you have done nothing wrong, if you have shown something beautiful about our country, don't get bullied. Be Indian. Be strong. Dear #Tanishq,\n\nsome of us live with,deal with and thrive with trolling everyday. If you know you are in the right, as a company people trust, be more solid. Don't let bullies trample Indian unity, creativity and expression.Make a statement. Keep the ad. Stay strong. Stay Indian. Shocking to see that 36% of people rate their average happiness in life below 4 out of 10. \n\nexplains a lot of the anger and negativity. \n\nHope you feel better guys. I am doubly grateful to be in the 8-10 category, where I thought most people would be. \n\nFocus on your happiness. https://t.co/qiG9eYi4Nn India was made from 500+ princely states. A beautiful federal structure was put in place to take into account we are different culture yet the same country. That\u2019s how was India was designed. Tinker with that foundation, try to assert superiority of one,it won\u2019t work well at all. A society where an individual is free to live their life to a large degree without fear or being negatively judged or bullied. What we are quite happy to lose right now to restore our fake self esteem. https://t.co/uvc8MEg2H8 Trust me they tried to bring me down. And many others too. But the only difference was that I worked harder and never gave up. \n\nI didn\u2019t whine. I worked. https://t.co/65jJcy4uXt Interesting thought. I guess it\u2019s a downward spiral or upward spiral. Growth and freedom go together in most cases. https://t.co/1dj1RMWv1T RT @hrnext: It\u2019s the other way round - poor economy leads to conservatism . Good income liberates people to enjoy new experiences . https:/\u2026 With all due respect, fight slavery by being creative, positive, self-development, chasing your dreams and making yourself and your country rise. Not by bullying, chest thumping, acting superior and dividing the country. https://t.co/o3lrmKvLrR On an average, scale of 1-10, how happy are you nowadays in life? I wonder what Mahatma Gandhi would have said about #Tanishq ad?\n\nA man who we call father of the nation, a man who we think is so important we print him on every currency note to remind ourselves of him, a man who helped create India.\n\nI wonder why we don't listen to him anymore? Good moves by @FinMinIndia including LTA encashment and others. Also signals a desire to increase consumption and kick-start the economy. More and more efforts will be required but this is a good step. You are going to have to fix your own life. Nobody will fix it for you. \n\nBlaming the system, Bollywood, media, politicians, religions other than yours, castes other than yours, privileged people, rich people - none of this changes YOUR life. \n\nYou will have to fix it yourself. If fake news is so common and normal, do fake ratings even surprise you? Outrage about insane 100% cut-offs that suggest a broken education system.  \n\nNot about some actor smoking a joint in some corner of their house. \n\nGet your priorities right. Or it all goes up in smoke anyway. \ud83d\udca8 Anti-success, anti-freedom, anti-harmony and pro supremacy of a certain community. That\u2019s the dominant narrative that people are sinking into. That is what gets instant likes. \n\nThat is not how India was designed to be. We will destroy our future if we do this. The kind of bullying style conservatism India is sinking into, could have devastating effects on our society -both in terms of the economy and harmony. It is up to the new generation to fight this if they want to save our free society.   Else they r the ones who will suffer most. Thank you.

The stories human beings love and understand the most are those with good people and bad people, all separate (Star Wars, Avengers.) We love to think we are good, someone else is bad.\n\nTruth is good and bad exists at the same time, within us, within society. When emotions decide a person's decisions - it leads to doom.\n\nWhen emotions decide a nation's decisions - it leads to doom.\n\nAlways. Freedom. Liberty. Equality. These are things our forefathers fought for. If in the name of 'cleanup' and being 'moral' and 'good' we give these values up, we would destroy something fundamental about being Indian, something our forefathers literally gave their lives for. Bollywood is one of the few Indian things that works well. It creates revenue, taxes, jobs and a lot of happiness. Drugs cleanup is great, but if in the process we destroy Bollywood, we'd have destroyed one of the few Indian things that worked well.

That will be needed, for sure. Instead of spreading fear and conspiracies, those who claim to care for farmers should inform them on how to benefit from farmers bills. Maybe make small collectives, or  apps to show prices, demand and supply across regions, or  buyer-seller meets, export opportunities etc. My column from 2015, arguing for similar reforms that have come through now. Took 5 years, but good to see change.\n\n\"Let\u2019s bake in India first: Open up the agriculture sector to help our farmers and our economy\" https://t.co/8OnKRlPZRc Have done countless columns urging govt to open up the economy more. To not acknowledge when they do that is hypocritical. \nThe Farmer Bills are a major reform, and frankly needed to tap India's potential as a major agricultural powerhouse in the world. We had LIC as the only insurance company. Other private players were allowed insurance which benefited the consumer. LIC is still around too.\n\nSame with the farmer bills. Private players will come. Improve choices for farmers. Govt will still be around. Learning more about the farmer's bills. However, whatever I researched so far, they seem to be well intentioned and will be good for farmers. \nFrom being forced to sell to a monopoly, to anywhere who offers them a better deal - it will improve farmer returns long term. 8 days to go for the release of One Arranged Murder\nFact 8: The book #OneArrangedMurder is a murder mystery, but there is also romance and humor in it, like all previous Chetan Bhagat books.\nPreorder your copy here: https://t.co/bKVFO32Awe https://t.co/W8LsTnwwyF 9 days to go for the release of One Arranged Murder\nFact 9: The book #OneArrangedMurder  has a tagline of RSVP: Malhotra Family, as seen on the cover as well.

Many parts of the world, marijuana is legalized - esp for medical purposes. It is also decriminalized in many places.\nOne visit to Varanasi will tell you that a lot of sadhus consume it. It is a good time to think about some changes in how we view it. As a boost for economic growth and farmers, had argued for legalizing medical marijuana in this column from one year ago, well before this controversy. As many countries legalize it, there is a multi-billion dollar export opportunity for India.\n\nhttps://t.co/eM4OVrFzuG If we liked justice we would care about getting justice to the child who was trying to wake up a dead mother on the platform. \n\nWhat we care about is seeing someone posting glamourous pictures on Instagram going to jail. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to be that way, just don\u2019t make a virtue of it.

Cut public sector salaries and watch the fun. Sections who definitely don't care about the economy:\n1. Public sector employed/ their kids - salary fixed. Who cares GDP down 24% or 48%. .\n2. Those who have no hope - even in the best of economy, nothing great will happen to them.\n\nThey want entertainment from news, not issues. Why Indians don't care about the economy (apart from 5%):\n\n1. They feel it makes no difference to them directly (bizarre).\n2. Cheap 4G data means brain is distracted on the phone to focus on real issues.\n3. They only want news with emotions and entertainment - economy has neither Lower GDP --&gt; Less jobs --&gt; more frustration --&gt; more anger/hate on twitter. I love Mumbai.

Some saying my today's tweet about developing countries cannot have same lockdown strategy as developed countries is with benefit of hindsight. Well this was my tweet on May 16. https://t.co/56S1WWG94w Celebrate the successful. Don't find reasons to hate on them. That's how successful nations are built. A rich person can take one year off for health reasons.\n\nA poor person can't. The poor person will somehow balance health and work.\n\nThat's  difference between developed and developing countries. Developing countries can't and shouldn't copy lockdown models of affluent countries. The more labor intensive a country, the bigger it gets hit by a lockdown, which is about movement of people.\n\nRich countries have a higher portion of their economic activity automated and computerized. \n\nThat's why India's GDP contraction is worse than many other nations. Don't spread baseless rumors on a successful industry that contributes to GDP and creates lots of direct and indirect employment, especially in these difficult times. \n\nWe are dealing with a -24% GDP contraction, it is no joke.\n\nDon't be anti-success. @SanaTokre_ wow how did u make this pic!?

But rich countries have the resources to withstand a contraction better than poor countries. They also already have good infra so that remains. In the end, poor countries will have to fight harder to come back and build themselves again. Focus on RHEA.\n\nBut the right RHEA.\n\nRe Habilitating Economic Activity. A -24% GDP growth means:\n\n- Govt revenues fall even more, as some taxes are on revenues, but many on profits,which have fallen more.\n- Job growth v low,layoffs and pay cuts\n- Crucial infra projects stuck\n- Less capital to invest for growth\n\nFix: Relentless focus on economy alone. GDP growth: -24% for last quarter. \n\nRequires immediate attention to bring this back to normal. Will affect everyone, eventually. Wives can be good. Wives can be bad. \nGirlfriends can be good. Girlfriends can be bad. \nSisters can be good. Sisters can be bad. \n\nPeople are good and bad.

However, as a multicultural nation where this issue was controversial once, there should be no chest thumping. We should make the temple just like Lord Rama would have liked - with humility.

They mutually decide to trash a movie or actor before the trial. Nobody wants to mess with them as they will collectively trash you. So people keep quiet. Many producers and directors in Bollywood will confirm this. Many know this, for those new here. \n1) 3 Idiots was based on my novel Five Point Someone and my story. \n2) The film won every story award that year.\n3) I was not given any of those story awards. They took them all.\n4) As a powerless newcomer I was bullied and was deeply affected They got away to a degree because social media wasn\u2019t that active as it is right now. Now, no chance in hell. Am overwhelmed at the support. https://t.co/GgOZFrhe9j Exhibit IV: snob and elitist critic. \n\nI didn\u2019t take any names. Why did he get  triggered?

Don't get rattled. https://t.co/IrcPMjkV1w One tweet and the whole eco-system gets rattled. I am obviously not holding her responsible. But she kept quiet then and is pontificating to me now. You know words like uncouth, doesn't automatically mean you understand what I said. https://t.co/jbTTpFrj4n Elitist snob Exhibit 3:\n\nNormally, this guy would be talking about the importance of mental health. But has no issues writing this about me in public, because his ilk allows that.\nAlso, again a talentless person who can't write one engaging paragraph certifying India's #1 writer. https://t.co/e09s85Kl31 Elitist snob exhibit II\n\nAnother talentless person who knows English hence feels entitled certifying and commenting crap on the #1 writer in the country.\n\nPS: Sorry, enough of being told to be modest. I am freaking awesome. Especially compared to these talentless people. https://t.co/T2rMR98eYM This tweet is only directed to the snob and elitist critics. So you can guess who is getting triggered by it. I only said be fair and sensible. Don't try dirty tricks. Why are they getting upset?\n\nPS: I do like fair, regular, down to earth critics and often read their work. https://t.co/HwiknublQu Ma'am, when your husband publicly bullied me, shamelessly collected all the best story awards, tried denying me credit for my story and drove me close to suicide, and you just watched, where was your discourse? https://t.co/CeVDT2oq47 RT @anupamachopra: Each time you think the discourse can\u2019t get lower, it does! https://t.co/yhkBUd8VSQ Elitist snobbery: Exhibit I\n\nTalentless, mean spirited people who only had the fortune of learning English and grew up in an English speaking environment and now feel superior and constantly mock other Indians. These are the people responsible for creating a bullying culture. https://t.co/i6elepl5He Many excellent film critics on radio, YouTube and blogs but are not given as much importance as phony, la-di-da English speaking ones. \n\nThe British left in 1947. Just FYI. Dear stars,\n\nYou make tens, maybe hundreds of crores. A country of a billion people loves you. Isn't that enough? Do you really need validation from phony, English speaking evil critics, who caused mental health issues leading to a star's death? Stop patronizing them, please. 'Maa kasam, mazaa aa gaya aapki mast picture dekh ke.'\n\n'Holy heavens. I was in ecstasy watching your sublime movie.'\n\nBoth lines essentially mean the same. But most Indians, even biggest stars want to hear the second. Hence,the vile critics became important.\n\nPut an end to this. Indians love validation from people who speak good English. It's the ultimate compliment. That's where some critics built profile. They spoke good English but were evil people. Stop looking at them for validation. They are brown outside - white inside people who hate Indians. There is one critic who tried to destroy my career and spew venom on everything I'm associated with. He also tried his best to sink Sushant. His main hates a)self made people b) less anglicized more desi people and c)confident small town Indians. I beg stars not to patronize him. To the media organizations who hire these snob critics - it's an awful business strategy to hire elitists who don't understand India and think they are better than Indians. These brown outside - white inside people will ensure your organization goes bankrupt. Many have already. Sushant's last film releases this week. I want to tell the snob and elitist critics right now, write sensibly. Don't act oversmart. Don't write rubbish. Be fair and sensible. Don't try your dirty tricks. You have ruined enough lives. Now stop. We'll be watching. The entertainment industry is so tough that mere survival is a huge victory. Everyone has their own journey. Assigning grades to people is only creating unnecessary anxiety and pressure. You managed to survive? To me, you are a star. Other people apart from actors work in a movie too, and play crucial parts in making a film. The way they are treated matters too.

Thanks for all the good work! https://t.co/Ra8Jyli8qg In most of the developed world, a GST or VAT sees all goods the same way. \nThis Indian habit of sitting around and morally judging goods and services, and then applying a random rate of tax on it based on their 'societal goodness' defeats the purpose of GST and hurts the economy. Overtaxing something:\n1. creates black market\n2. makes the industry uncompetitive\n3. makes investors scared\n4. adds to individual's burden for no fault\n5. makes India less competitive vs rest of the world\n6. is unfair Whatever your moral stance on alcohol, it is silly to judge people buying a legally permitted product. If the crowd was too much, says something about the way the sales and supplies are managed/conducted too.\nAlcohol is giving revenue to states today, your moral lectures aren't. On one hand we invite foreign investments saying India is a great place to do business, on the other we massively raise taxes on a product category to a massive level based on some morality or random justification.\n\nInvestors hate unpredictability in policy.

Yay! \n\nOh wait. Today, under normal circumstances, was supposed to be a 3-day weekend.\n\nSome would have looked forward to not go anywhere and just be at home on the long weekend. Think about florists. \ud83e\udd40\ud83d\ude22 To fund the massive fiscal costs of a rescue plan, the government could issue special crisis bonds, with a 10, 20, 30 year duration. Many people are likely to invest in them. Relying on charity and benevolence is not the way to handle a crisis like this. All that looks good on social media, but this needs a massive fiscal plan, far and beyond what charity, NGOs and requests can achieve. \n\nThe poor need help. In massive doses. The upper middle class and above:\nThere's nothing left to watch on Netflix.\n\nThe poor:\nThere's nothing left to eat.\n\n#LockdownEffect Every one is suffering. \nBut the affluent, upper middle class suffer less.\n\nThe poor suffer a lot more, to the point of survival. And they aren't on social media.\n\nEvery lockdown related decision should be taken with care, balanced, calibrated  and with reason as well as emotion Some people say the world will change even after lockdown ends and all this Corona stuff becomes okay. People won\u2019t travel as much.\nDon\u2019t know about others. But I plan to travel more than ever, whenever I can, because you never know what will happen tommorrow. @MRINAAL_BISHT Just focus on your work and keep going. Ignore sad people venting out their frustrations. In life, work talks, eventually. Amazing to see Instastories flooded with people reading my books in the lockdown.\n\nThank you all! Keep reading! \n\nTogether we shall overcome this! https://t.co/qCjxnW1re7 Acc to this survey (39k votes), 93% ppl support lockdown extension (59% as is, 34% a milder version). https://t.co/8LLklALtcE Acc to this survey (24k votes), staggering 76% people see their incomes/ job/ business/ salary getting negatively affected! https://t.co/tqJcSWpTVN The resourceful ones will use the lockdown to plan their next move, set future goals and will be ready to go when it all ends.\n\nThe rest will do 'timepass' during lockdown, then find it difficult to get back in the rhythm when things get normal.\n\nUse lockdown time productively. Fantastic video. Do watch.\nAnd thank you @MumbaiPolice ! https://t.co/gGnjoF0QCo Do you think the lockdown should be extended? @AbhinandanSekhr For some reason we don\u2019t seem to be as affected or talking about it as much though. The affluent USA for eg is talking about eco issues so much. We don\u2019t. Wonder why? Do you personally see YOUR income/ job/ business/ salary likely to be negatively affected by the Coronavirus? 31% more worried about Corona. \n22% more worried about Economy/Jobs.\n40% equally worried about both.\n\nThe economy matters and plenty are beginning to think so. Saving the economy means saving lives as well. https://t.co/KMUYALsFFf 85% of people are slightly anxious or more over Corona. 35% are extremely anxious.\n\nTo those 35%, manage your anxiety levels, they could cause harm.

Do read, especially those who can't stop making personal attacks. https://t.co/II6yzn78CM India is handling Coronavirus pretty well.\n\nIf there is something to be done that doesn't involve  politics and communalism, Indians are frankly amongst the best in the world. Being not scared enough \ndoesn't mean \nnot taking it seriously enough.\n\nOne doesn't have to demonstrate extreme panic and anxiety to show you care about Coronavirus.\n\nEmotions don't matter. Precautions do. @mindTumult @NetNazigiri have explained this in my previous tweets about Italian cases. Please go through. Total cases is what can infect. The %growth trend is extremely important. if it goes to zero, means no new cases. if it stays constant it's exponential growth. i do know what i am talking about. Between Corona and the Economy/Unemployment, what are you more worried about? Given what you know now, how anxious are you about the whole Corona situation? Italy (first out of control Euro country) update:\nFrom 23% daily new case growth 11-March, to just 2.8% new growth yesterday. Absolute cases falling too. \nRest of Europe shows similar trends.\n\nUS numbers high, but recovery should happen soon.\n\nGo Corona Go by May2020 hopefully! https://t.co/ieJ7sIt10e I wonder if the world locks down cigarettes and junk food, how many lives would we save each year? Cases: 2.79 million/year\nDeaths: 435k /year\n\nThat's not Corona. That's TB in India, how it is usually, 1100 deaths a day.\n\nExcept, you don't get daily case scores, world doesn't panic about it. And even though it transmits thru air, we don't do lockdowns for it.\n\n#Coronapanic India's unemployment rate more than triples in two weeks to a staggering 23%. \n\nWe cannot ignore this forever. https://t.co/ldnZ057z3x RT @BBCIndia: India's unemployment rate rises over 23%, post lockdown, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy.\n(CMIE)\n\nhttps\u2026 Please make sure social isolation doesn\u2019t turn into social discrimination.

Practising meditation in such times can ease the mind. Join me as I tune in to Daaji\u2019s LIFEcast, where he will conduct worldwide meditation on 2nd April at 5:30 pm IST on https://t.co/ER6Z1j78lp https://t.co/dosmYfVRXt You have to be someone to get insulted bro. https://t.co/BsMOevjIsz @bakarconsultant @complyeasy but u told me my figures are misleading. and that with a  rising base, % has to come down (it doesn't). and yes that's exactly what i was saying and now u seem to agree. things are better there that's all. @shishirjha07 people who understand get it. few trolls who don't understand things doesn't change  analysis. the 'people telling umpteen times' are a few who refuse to understand it. and then use words like idiot without really any cogent argument. failure of our education system. not ur fault @roam_free but new infections are coming from the infected. who told told you they aren't? population of the country doesn't magically spawn the virus. it gets transmitted from someone who has it. @bakarconsultant @complyeasy u can but then u agree that the base and growth rate are important. ur method adds a complication that's all. but to look at absolute cases makes less sense. 50 to 51k is not same as 250 to 251k. @PRAMILSHARMA fair, ideally should be on active cases, but that increases the complication and as you can see twitter finds it hard enough to grasp concept of growth rate and its trend. @DunCat9 am not targeting u but just citing ur example. plus your statement applying math to this is lame hypothesis - what did it even mean? esp if u work in the field. am looking at actual data. how is it lame hypothesis? why can't math be applied to anything? A staggering 49% of American companies are considering layoffs. \n\nScary to think what is coming for India. We need a plan in place on how to handle this after we get past this.\n\nOh wait, no talking of economy right now.\n\nhttps://t.co/hYPVssRwuK It's not obvious at all the % will go down, in fact it didn't for a long time and only is doing so now. \nI know what i am saying before I post any data, so before commenting spend some time understanding it, or ask someone who knows. https://t.co/kfJM5d8CkE Several people have this misconception and it is not the right way to look at it. The base total cases is people who can infect. Growth rate is the rate of spread on this base. \nAbsolute numbers matter less. The negative trend of growth rate matters far more (and is looking good) https://t.co/TFR6HGeNPM Genuine Positive Corona News:\n1. Italian New Case Growth Rate continues to fall. \n2. Johnson &amp; Johnson plans human trials for Covid vaccine in Sep-20. Out by early-21. J&amp;J Shares up 8%\n3. Global daily case growth rates also falling.\n\nCorona will be contained. In a matter of weeks If New Daily Growth Rate continues to fall, and ultimately goes to near zero, cases peak and with recoveries ultimately decline. \nCrazy infection numbers assume constant exponential growth rate, which isn't really happening anywhere on a sustained basis. Italian New Cases Daily Growth continues to decline, 4 days in a row, and now only at 4.1% vs 15% 10 days ago. Italy was what created worldwide panic, and seems to be getting under control. And if Italy can be controlled, so will other countries.\nApocalypse won't happen! https://t.co/F61UGkkRkz Talking about the economy in shutdown times is being the relative who expresses concern about the hospital bill when a family member is in the hospital.\n\nNot popular at all.\n\nVery important, nonetheless. @sonamakapoor Of course!

Thank u USA cases update:\nDaily New Cases Rate shows some decline, though still v high at 19% (was 45% 10days ago).\n\nA USA peak in cases would mean the world will end its panic. It's still a while away though. https://t.co/lGqIp5dgTU Italy cases update.\nDaily New Cases Rate continues to fall, although slowly. Now at 6.9%, vs 20% two weeks ago.\nWhy Italy? Because it was the first major Western country, which seemed to be going out of control.\nNow it does seem to be in control. https://t.co/3CVrSsnx0A 90% of cases in cold countries with 14-4C temperature.\n\nIndia agri sector is already not in a lockdown.\n\nIndia cases v low compared to Europe/USA.\n\nMaybe release 10 hottest out of 500+ districts to see if cases spike. Restore if they do. \n\nWorth a thought. Economic knowledge in India is so limited, that even amongst educated English speaking people, many believe:\n1. Stock market doesn\u2019t affect them. It\u2019s only for greedy rich people. \n2. Economy baad mein sambhal lenge. Well if we get in a debt trap, baad mein is a v long time. Hi all, \n\n\"Corona lockdown is needed but it might put the economy on ventilator,\" my col in TOI today:\n\nDo read. Feedback and constructive suggestions welcome (after you have read it!).  \n\nhttps://t.co/1GHkAy3U9Y Hi all, \n\n\"Corona lockdown is needed but it might put the economy on ventilator,\" my column in TOI today:\n\n https://t.co/1GHkAy3U9Y One best tip to handle the #lockdown? Scale of 1..10, how bored are you right now? It\u2019s Saturday. Just realised. Thanks for your honest reply sir. and thanks for serving the nation for 34years. https://t.co/rgYQRoaaZs @vishaldevpura interesting, and that the trend holds even on mar 27 shows something..let's see Here's my lil chart of the day. Cases vs temperature.\nNote:\n1. worldwide virus, but top-14 countries contribute 87% of cases.\n2. Min-Max temp in top14 countries average 14-4 C.\n3. No hot country in top14.\n4. India temperatures, way higher: 30-20 C range, and going to get hotter. https://t.co/DXmMjuw3el Data suggest no hot country has had a massive number of cases yet, even though the virus is there in all countries.\n\nLimited evidence on temperature vs virus, but there is definitely some effect.\n\nCorona, hoping you wouldn't survive the Indian summer. Few things can. US employment data just came out. \n\nLast week: 282k\nThis week: 3.28 million!\n\nThe previous record in 2008 recession was 665k. \n\n3million jobs lost in the US in a week! \n\nThat\u2019s the next crisis we need to be prepared for here as well. Why do police beat or are cruel to poor people up already suffering from the lockdown?\n\nAre they so diligent about their duty and fighting the Coronavirus?\n\nIs there a power trip they get in being violent?\n\nHas someone told them to?\n\nThey like it?\n\nGenuinely confused. https://t.co/CWOGvJuG45 Please look into genuine issues like this. https://t.co/T7lua0D4OK Good move by FM to announce 1.7lakh crore package to help the poor. \n\nNobody knows where this will go, or if more steps will be needed, but this is a good move. #readmore \ud83d\ude01 https://t.co/H57NLRGOlq \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd17 https://t.co/h9gMacEYng Great compilation - data and examples. Please go through.\n\nWhat India is going through with this lockdown is unique - this is not happening in developed countries with shutdowns.\n\nIndia needs special steps urgently. We can\u2019t merely copy-paste developed country lockdown templates. https://t.co/QqO0HzERtp Positive news update: Italian new cases growth vs previous day continues to fall, now at 7.5% vs 23% per day 2 weeks ago. https://t.co/j75MJKZtRL If we can send planes across the world to bring citizens back, surely we can find a way to make daily wagers reach their villages - which is better than walking hundreds of kilometers.\n\nMaybe some innovation? Disposable plastic/latex suits + special buses? The real test of a society is during tough times. If we are kind, compassionate and patient; if we can care and be nice to each other; we will survive this. This is a test, not just to fight the virus, but to see the kind of people we are. Am amazed thinking like this exists. https://t.co/jd7miC0a8l Celebrities, NGOs, citizens should and will come forward to do their bit for those affected by the lockdown. Appreciate that.\n\nHowever, the problem on hand is far bigger in scale than to be handled by good samaritans alone. Comprehensive national level plan needed asap. Execution.\n\nNo matter how great the plan is, it all comes down to the execution. \n\nIf execution involves the most impoverished being hurt the most, something is not right. The real solution, apart from lockdown, will come if there is extensive testing, isolation of cases and their contacts. A lot of trust and co-operation is needed. If authorities and police show brutality, people will hide information and make the exercise counter productive. Are their numbers/addresses/methods on how daily wage labor is getting their payments from states? Or is it automatic. Please do share the process. Will help spread and encourage others to. A lockdown only buys time. \nOther steps are must to prevent spread post lockdown.\nExtensive testing, isolating cases and contact tracing are must.\n\nNot me saying it. The WHO head is. Watch full video here:https://t.co/DgJkvuYtGr The US is planning a $2 trillion stimulus package to compensate for Corona impact. That's Rs 150 lakh crores.\n\nWe can't spend that much. But our per-capita income is 1/30th of USA. \n\nOn that account, we need at least Rs 5 lakh crores. My salute to all those state governments who have announced payments to daily wagers. They are really suffering. \n\nRequest other parts of the country to follow \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb . My lockdown resolutions:\na. Eat healthier\nb. Read more\n\nYours? Lockdown positives:\n1. No traffic\n2. Don\u2019t have to meet the boss\n3. Can dress silly all day\n4. Can sleep more. \n5. Can watch as much screen\n6. Can avoid people u didn\u2019t want to meet. \n7. Helping the nation and the world\n8. The virus gets contained! Don\u2019t call it lockdown. Call it Staycation. \n\nAm on a 21 day staycation. Today is day 1. \n\nSounds much better right? Try a new diet. \nMake a business plan. \nCall old friends and talk. \nPaint. Sing. Upload a video. \nMake a life plan. \nCook. Dance. Write. Play indoor games with family. \nNo pressure to perform. Just be. \nCome to think of it, these 21 days can be beautiful and just what u needed! Don\u2019t see it as a lockdown. See it as a chance to focus 21 days on something you have been meaning to do, but never got around to it otherwise. \n\nYou can waste this time. Or you can create magic. Use it wisely. \ud83d\udd10 \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 \ud83d\udd10 My thoughts and prayers tonight with the poor people of India - the daily wagers who will suffer the most next 3 weeks. \n\nPoverty is a disease, and in times like these one can tell why. \n\nHope the authorities and police are kind to them \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\n #lockdown21 The lockdown is painful. \n\nBut don\u2019t try to game it. \n\nDon\u2019t keep roaming around carrying a milk packet in your hand for instance, saying I came out to get milk. \n\nIndians are very good at this gaming and jugaad but don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s for your own good. \n\n#lockdown21 Too many doubts in people\u2019s minds. Need to be clarified. Hearing reports of people running to hoard essentials. There\u2019s no need. Essentials are still available and okay. Please don\u2019t panic #lockdown21 The toughest 21 days India has ever faced. #Lockdown21 long but v interesting read. https://t.co/jGmyWGcOBY Instagram stories about my books have increased 3-4x since last week. Am sure same happening for other books too.\n\nPeople are reading more. And that's good. :) The guards who have to reach swanky buildings but have no public transport are not on twitter.\n\nNeither are roadside sellers, maids, uber drivers with EMIs, restaurant staff and auto drivers.\n\nWhile lockdown is important, we must do something for those affected the most as well. Amidst the gloom, here's what I feel is definitely good news. \n\nOne v imp global metric: Daily New Italian Cases growth is falling, for 4 consecutive days now, down to 8% from 23% less than 2-weeks ago. \n\nExponential growth assumptions therefore won't apply.\n\nSee chart and share. https://t.co/yRx2myj8bl Corona will drive Indian economy to the wall. \n\nThe only positive, is like 1991, we will have to finally act on reforms. \n\nCoz when it comes to economy, we are like \u201cunless it\u2019s smashed to pieces, why fix it?\u201d\n\nIt will be smashed to pieces. We are doing it right now. Sensex hovering at mid-2014 levels. Wiping out 6 years of gains. \nRupee all time low. \n\nI know people think this is not the priority right now or this won\u2019t directly affect them. But it will.\nIt surely will. \nBecause lockdowns have a bill. How economic crisis will flow:\nTourism + Hospitality + Travel + Retail --&gt; Real estate --&gt; Banks --&gt; Credit slowdown --&gt; All Industry --&gt; job losses --&gt; demand down --&gt; recession\n\nSolution:\nMassive, massive opening up of the economy post Covid, even more reforms than 1991. \u0936\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e! https://t.co/r5i8hSsdqC \"If we live, then we will think about jobs,\" is the common sentiment at the moment, justifying stricter and stricter measures (usually by people who have the power to sustain themselves without work for a while).\n\nLet's see if that sentiment remains in 2 weeks. If only there was a count of the number of jobs lost alongside the total number of cases. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udd14\n\nTo everyone working in healthcare, directly or indirectly, thank you! \n\n\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udd14 Thanks! https://t.co/tf5n1xMZwS Thanks! https://t.co/SeF2zkpZrW Thank you.

However, since March growth began again. \nOnly this time, the March slope is less steep than earlier. Good news?\nOther math enthusiasts, your opinion? https://t.co/xJzC5j8Fb1 Study. Cook. Clean. Talk to family. Call old friends. Watch TV. Surf the net. Exercise at home. Meditate. Sleep. Rest. Eat. Shower. Repair something broken. Rearrange cupboards. Organise your paperwork.

Just learnt that even though supporters of political parties hate on each other all day long on Twitter, the senior leaders of these parties love to hang out and party together, even in times of a virus! So much love! Don\u2019t party for a few days. Please. Things that can be done in this time (apart from just chilling):\n1. Working out using exercise videos\n2.  Resetting your diet\n3.

The virus is going to take its time and all governments are doing their best to fight it. Getting hourly updates on the virus is not helpful.\nUsing this time for self-growth is. Airlines. Hotels. Restaurants. Events. Retail. Sectors getting whacked so badly, many players will be bankrupt and cutting massive amounts of jobs in a few weeks. The world is reacting to the virus on a day by day basis, with steps that are short-term at best. Meanwhile, economies are getting wrecked around the world and we don\u2019t know if we are solving the problem or simply postponing it. Never before has a disease come where the number of cases is shared like live cricket scores. Don\u2019t know if such an overload of info helps or makes anxiety levels worse. The economic contraction, bankruptcies and job losses to come scare me just as much as the virus. Fear kills the mind far more than the virus kills people. so many corona memes \ud83d\ude48 @NetflixIndia 2 States\nHalf Girlfriend\n\n:) I encourage everyone to read this fantastic  interview of Micheal Levitt, a Nobel prize winner and Stanford prof. \n\nHe discusses why Covid won't grow exponentially.\n\n\"if you consider your own social circle, you basically meet the same people every day\"\n\nhttps://t.co/dmW53IBwJ7 Countries where daily new cases dropped/are dropping:\n-China\n-South Korea\n- UK and Italy (last couple of days)\n \nWhere daily new cases still rising fast:\n- US, Spain, France\n\nAfter an exponential rise, there is/will be a plateau.

I give an opinion only on an opinions page. @UnSubtleDesi I am giving an opinion. On the opinion page of a newspaper. I thought that\u2019s pretty obvious. Anyway, don\u2019t think you are up for a point wise specific response. So let it be. God bless. @UnSubtleDesi We can\u2019t be factual about an exercise that\u2019s not happened. Even if you do include some facts, it still will have an element of opinion in it. Like your assertion about what I deserve is also an opinion. Upto you. If you want to respond or not. @UnSubtleDesi I think nobody needs to retract. We can let both our opinions be there. And I can acknowledge yours and you can acknowledge mine. Thanks. Shall wait then. Do read. Especially if you support it. And with folded hands, request you to read it fully and then respond on specific points. And be polite. Please. https://t.co/aH28RGgMy2 Thanks https://t.co/xf6oDmthbJ @UnSubtleDesi Can you please go through the column and counter the points logically than lamenting on the opportunities I worked hard to get or making personal attacks. Hold you in high regard so Will appreciate it. Thank you sir https://t.co/Bj66E3ImFd RT @TVMohandasPai: I agree; @PMOIndia @narendramodi @AmitShah Govt does not have capacity to do this;All will suffer in the hands of corrup\u2026 Thank u https://t.co/eRVVSCyj4r @SunirKheterpal Thanks khatsss Hi all,\n\n\u201cWhy NRC must be shelved,\u201d my Col in TOI today: \n\nDo read fully before commenting. Do share with as many Indians as you can. \n\nhttps://t.co/KvQfvuYwAJ If we can just brush the Hindu-Muslim issues aside for  next 20 years, and focus on growing the economy, we can easily reach $10,000 per capita GDP by 2040.\n \nThen we can fight all we want.\n\nBut my guess is, when incomes reach that level, we won't fight like this. Inflation: 6-year high\n\nGDP growth: 6-year low\n\nThis needs to be our number one priority. The rest of the never ending and somewhat pointless identity politics stuff can wait. AAP changed its way of working dramatically last 2 years.\n\nThey listened to the criticism and acted on it. \n\nThey are now leading in opinion polls in Delhi.\n\nIf they win, scaling up outside Delhi will become a possibility again. Ultimately no matter what posturing people do, every issue on Twitter boils down to do you like Modi or not. Effect of 99% cutoffs? A bunch of \u201csmart\u201d kids who are very good at pointing errors but miss the overall point. Ma\u2019am ma\u2019am college nahi university hai. Oh so bright u are. The essence of the statement doesn\u2019t change and you didn\u2019t get it but here, take ur \u201cI am right badge\u201d. Two big dates coming up\n\nFeb 1: Budget. Will show how serious we are about the economy. \n\nFeb 11: Delhi election results. Some indication of the political impact of recent events. \n\nIndia may be whatever, but it is never boring. JNU is just one college.\n\nThere are nearly 40,000 colleges in India.\n\nI understand it is important. But there is a limit to how much importance and attention one college gets.\n\nThere are more important issues in a country of 1.2bn people I am sure. I am going to disappoint everyone who thinks I am in a camp. People in India understand serving someone. Our faulty education makes people incapable of thinking for themselves. They find it hard to deal with independent minds with different opinions in different situations. But you were that side na? No, your brain was limited. Still is. @seemay \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 I wish GDP had a religion so more people would care for it.\nI wish healthcare was fought for like we fight for our traditions.\nI wish scientific education was valued like our scriptures.\nI wish the country\u2019s infrastructure was built like places of worship, with as much pride. I wish GDP had a religion so a lot more people would care for it. There\u2019s a lot of value in simplifying things. \n\nIt is not that simple to be simple. Saying \u201cNRC will definitely come\u201d and then saying \u201cbut did I show u details yet?\u201d\n\n is like saying\n\n\u201cyou will have to marry where I ask you to\u201d  and then saying \u201cbut did I show you any boys yet?\u201d\n\nBe clear. If it is not coming, shelve it. Restore peace and order. The NRC is unimplementable due to massive execution issues. \n\nTime to put it to rest. Not the right time at all. \n\nWith growing US-Iran tensions, higher oil prices and our already weak economy, we need to do everything we can to restore stability. Many people have invited or welcomed me to their club given my recent specific views on a specific issue. \n\nNeither was I a member of the other club. Nor would I like to be of yours. \n\nSure, happy to have a cup of tea now and then in either club. \n\nBut Life membership? No thanks. Stand up for what you feel is right, that\u2019s all. \n\nWhatever you think is the right thing for your country. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to agree with my view or anyone else\u2019s. \n\nBut just make sure it is your view. You have thought through it and is not coming out of blind fandom or hate. All the best to \n@deepikapadukone @masseysahib\n @meghnagulzar and the entire team of #Chhapaak !

All the best to the entire team! https://t.co/I7NM0defib Time to see obvious. \n\nPut CAA aside, officially. Major communication gaps.\n\nAnnounce NRC won\u2019t come, as execution issues, anxiety created and the chances of abuse means we are not ready for it.\n\nFocus on upcoming budget.\n\nIt\u2019s not worth it. Can\u2019t let a country burn to save ego. Deeply, deeply concerned about the #JNUAttacks.\n\nThey are Indian students. In an Indian college.\n\nIt\u2019s not ok to attack or make any Indian college feel unsafe.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t change even if the college is AMU, Jamia or JNU.\n\nWe destroy our nation if we do or secretly condone this. \u201cIndia\u2019s Goal for decade: $5,000 per capita GDP by 2030,\u201d my Col in ToI today. \n\nShare with as many Indians as possible.

Why is an law like CAA, technically meant for foreigners affecting Indians so much?\n\nCause another law called NRC is coming, which essentially assumes all Indians are foreigners unless they can prove otherwise. \n\nThis needs to be fixed. CAA is a life jacket. \n\nNRC is everyone being pushed out of the plane as they have to prove themselves all over again. \n\nBut Muslims don\u2019t  get the life jacket. \n\nDistributing life jackets is not the problem. Giving them only to a few and pushing everyone off the plane is. CAA by itself not the issue.\nBut CAA+NRC is discriminatory. This could happen.\n\nNRC:\nAll prove again u r Indian \n\nNon-Muslim: sir I don\u2019t have documents \nGovt: it\u2019s ok. CAA will save you. U are indian. \n\nMuslim: sir I don\u2019t have documents\nGovt: too bad.U are not indian.Get out. @RahulEaswar thank u rahul. @elsamariedsilva It is a legitimate government. Elected by people. @GAUAHAR_KHAN welcome :) Said this just 2 days ago. It's true. Impact wise, one good protest in Delhi = 30 protests in all other states. https://t.co/QQAm0hu5k4 Those who fantasize about India with a Hindu king and his subservient subjects, remember this. Even if I dignified your bigotry (I don\u2019t), you can't wish 200mn Muslims away. Try that and India will burn,GDP will crash and your kids will be unsafe and jobless.Stop these fantasies! Demo\nGST\n370\nCAB\n\nPost-announcement issues in all. Suggests there is an army of yes-men in the govt who nod at everything, do not think things through or raise genuine doubts.\n\nMaybe think about the decision making process. Whatever their historical names, there are no Hindu or Muslim universities in India. They are all Indian universities. And they all must be protected. Many get confused about my politics here.  To be clear am only interested in an India where everybody lives in harmony and we have stellar economic growth. That is my dream. One-sided groupings bore me. I am not on your fixed side. I am on India\u2019s side. And am proud of that. Crashing the economy. Making jobs vanish. Shutting down Internet. Sending police in libraries. The youth may have patience, but don\u2019t test the limits of it. The youth is angry. There are not enough jobs. Salaries are low. Don\u2019t mess with them. The first priority should be to lift the economy back again. The CAB required more education, more consensus building, a lot better wording and frankly better intentions. Stirring the social pot constantly is going to hurt us and the already weak economy. Repeated and prolonged Internet shutdowns hurt business and the economy. Sends a message that we are an unpredictable, third-world country where things are not under control. Even non-democratic China never did it during Hong Kong protests. Lagta hai Delhi mein elections aane wale hain. People opposing CAB are those who want to include nobody and those who want to include everybody. Pollution or protest, it has to reach Delhi, else it doesn\u2019t seem to matter. Kashmir matters. Assam matters. Tripura matters. Internet shutdowns, in this era of online dependence for everyday life, should be avoided. If at all, they can be done on an exceptional basis for a very short time duration to diffuse a situation. To make it a way of life is draconian. Kashmir matters. Tripura matters. Assam matters. Shutting down Internet doesn\u2019t shut down the resentment. 3 tips to be more successful. https://t.co/hOeklYyhN5 Do you wanna partner.. o partner..\n\nGuess who I met today!

Meanwhile, there is no doubt we need a good refugee policy.  Drafting and executing one is not simple at all. In all this, There is no doubt India was, is, and must remain a secular republic We were, are and will always remain a secular nation. However, if India won\u2019t shelter oppressed Hindus from around the world, who will? Any Hindu oppressed anywhere in the world for their religion is welcome to make India their home.

Having 3-4 people in life who really care\n3. A healthy body, a decent diet\n4. Enough sleep\n5. Avoiding negativity at all costs. Time management (practically doing it):\n1. Cut your phone screen time (most people are 5hrs+, get to 2)\n2. Make to-do lists for next day the night before\n3. Don't waste time on bad relationships and useless work\n4. End of day, ask, how did I get closer to my goal today? 3 things that make a big difference to your success (not dependent on talent)\n1. Having clear goals- where you want to be by when\n2.

Issues are tough but still in resolvable state, if all stakeholders act swiftly. Interesting to see how this develops. Has wider implications for Indian economy. Yes Bank needs a staggering $1bn-$2bn in new capital to keep running. All this, while it deals with bad news, massive stock declines, black box loan book, plummeting confidence and promoter already having sold stake. It is not easy at all to raise that kind of money. Happened with Kingfisher. Happened with Jet. When trouble begins, Indian procedures are so slow and cumbersome that recovery is v difficult. Confidence crisis makes it worse.

And thanks! https://t.co/H4TCx1naYa There are some liberal-tolerant types who are secretly wishing for (and even somewhat inciting) unrest and violence in Kashmir only so they can attack the government. Sir your entire country is a human rights violation. Please focus on improving that. Would you like it if we peeked in your internal matters? https://t.co/ZXqJJa9EO9 The major liberal-elitist-Lutyens types objection to Article 370 isn\u2019t that it was removed or how it was done. It is mainly that they weren\u2019t consulted or given importance. Sir you have the right to your views but 1) 370 was removed by an elected parliament, after the region failed to be fixed. comparing it to Babri mob is incorrect. 2) Babri caused riots, we r trying to prevent them right now. Is it responsible to compare 370 and Babri like this? https://t.co/U8BuZLjCux This guy sold me my own book !\ud83d\ude02 His reaction when he found out was so sweet. \u2665\ufe0f.

It only created selfish leaders who created a terror filled society and robbed Kashmiri youth of opportunity. It is finally time for it to go.

Well, nothing much has changed since. https://t.co/4tQVRT3A2x My column from Jan 2018, on 10 things the Congress could do for good performance in the 2019 elections. (PS: They didn't follow any.)

World, welcome to the climax of the greatest and biggest democracy in the world! #ElectionResults2019 Extraordinary day! Who's up and waiting already? #ElectionResults2019 When election results come, who will the elitists/ Modi haters/ opposition blame this time? If the results are in Modi\u2019s favor on 23rd (as all exit polls are saying), just one request to the opposition. Please, please spend the next 5 years improving yourselves rather than hating Modi. All the intellectual hate in the world cannot fight the will of the people. Aayega to.. 2 years since #halfgirlfriend The film that taught me so much, and gave me friends for life.

Please see this before you believe/ forward/ react to anything else. It is important we remain calm and stick to proper sources for our information. https://t.co/gQB1kXecGE Reacting when our soldiers are killed isn't war mongering, it is self defence. Nobody in India wants war. We were happily waiting for the next Bollywood film or cricket match before they backed a terror attack at Pulwama. They did it first. We had no choice but to teach a lesson. Great job by the IAF. And great choice of words by govt \"non-military preemptive action against terrorists (and not against Pak)\". Makes it difficult for Pak to escalate. Josh and Hosh both on display. Very well done. #IndianAirForce #IndiaStrikesBack When you slap us, we will no longer turn the other cheek.
