Boredom (really?)\n\nFinally, only leads to:\n1. Addiction\n2. Destruction Natural highs come from achieving success, fitness, relationships. These require effort. It's the brain's reward system.

Conspiracy theory template (any):\nBeliever: X killed Y\nYou: There's no proof.\nBeliever: See that's the conspiracy. X hid the proof.\nYou: Do you have any evidence?\nBeliever: No. X hid it.\nYou: How can u assume all this?\nBeliever: See, you are part of the conspiracy too.\n\nRepeat. So tempting to go with the flow, tweet what mob wants, even your heart doesn't agree with it. So easy to get likes, fans,followers,even sales.

Many parts of the world, marijuana is legalized - esp for medical purposes. It is also decriminalized in many places.\nOne visit to Varanasi will tell you that a lot of sadhus consume it. It is a good time to think about some changes in how we view it. As a boost for economic growth and farmers, had argued for legalizing medical marijuana in this column from one year ago, well before this controversy. As many countries legalize it, there is a multi-billion dollar export opportunity for India.\n\nhttps://t.co/eM4OVrFzuG If we liked justice we would care about getting justice to the child who was trying to wake up a dead mother on the platform. \n\nWhat we care about is seeing someone posting glamourous pictures on Instagram going to jail. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to be that way, just don\u2019t make a virtue of it.

Cut public sector salaries and watch the fun. Sections who definitely don't care about the economy:\n1. Public sector employed/ their kids - salary fixed. Who cares GDP down 24% or 48%. .\n2. Those who have no hope - even in the best of economy, nothing great will happen to them.\n\nThey want entertainment from news, not issues. Why Indians don't care about the economy (apart from 5%):\n\n1. They feel it makes no difference to them directly (bizarre).\n2. Cheap 4G data means brain is distracted on the phone to focus on real issues.\n3. They only want news with emotions and entertainment - economy has neither Lower GDP --&gt; Less jobs --&gt; more frustration --&gt; more anger/hate on twitter. I love Mumbai.

Some saying my today's tweet about developing countries cannot have same lockdown strategy as developed countries is with benefit of hindsight. Well this was my tweet on May 16. https://t.co/56S1WWG94w Celebrate the successful. Don't find reasons to hate on them. That's how successful nations are built. A rich person can take one year off for health reasons.\n\nA poor person can't. The poor person will somehow balance health and work.\n\nThat's  difference between developed and developing countries. Developing countries can't and shouldn't copy lockdown models of affluent countries. The more labor intensive a country, the bigger it gets hit by a lockdown, which is about movement of people.\n\nRich countries have a higher portion of their economic activity automated and computerized. \n\nThat's why India's GDP contraction is worse than many other nations. Don't spread baseless rumors on a successful industry that contributes to GDP and creates lots of direct and indirect employment, especially in these difficult times. \n\nWe are dealing with a -24% GDP contraction, it is no joke.\n\nDon't be anti-success. @SanaTokre_ wow how did u make this pic!?

But rich countries have the resources to withstand a contraction better than poor countries. They also already have good infra so that remains. In the end, poor countries will have to fight harder to come back and build themselves again. Focus on RHEA.\n\nBut the right RHEA.\n\nRe Habilitating Economic Activity. A -24% GDP growth means:\n\n- Govt revenues fall even more, as some taxes are on revenues, but many on profits,which have fallen more.\n- Job growth v low,layoffs and pay cuts\n- Crucial infra projects stuck\n- Less capital to invest for growth\n\nFix: Relentless focus on economy alone. GDP growth: -24% for last quarter. \n\nRequires immediate attention to bring this back to normal. Will affect everyone, eventually. Wives can be good. Wives can be bad. \nGirlfriends can be good. Girlfriends can be bad. \nSisters can be good. Sisters can be bad. \n\nPeople are good and bad. A particular relationship itself doesn\u2019t guarantee it will be good. \n\nStereotypes cannot substitute investigations. It\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that emotional Indians have been played and made fools of in a particular case, by unscrupulous anchors and keen for views youtubers. The facts are coming out.   \n\nLet Indians please learn from this and avoid media trials. Trust institutions.

Wake up to the new reality. There's an enormous, unimaginable amount of hard work and anxiety behind any self-made Indian rising to the top. A certain section of brown outside-white inside elitists found it fun to insult such Indians.Not cool anymore. \n\nIt's because of that talented boy. God bless his soul. It's no longer cool to piss on the work of self-made Indians. That obnoxious set of elitists has become quiet. First time I am seeing that. \n\nThat talented boy's loss has created this change.

But celebrations and humility can go together, isn\u2019t it? https://t.co/zbgDpvWNVx Thank u sir https://t.co/08BgGkZhBJ I am happy that the Ram Temple is being built at the site that holds so much faith. However, as a multicultural nation where this issue was controversial once, there should be no chest thumping. We should make the temple just like Lord Rama would have liked - with humility. Had I done a column on a sensational issue or something emotional, would have got 10x to 100x more views. However, what's important needs to be said. \n\n'A vaccine for the economy: Making Corona an opportunity for India,' my column in TOI today.

They mutually decide to trash a movie or actor before the trial. Nobody wants to mess with them as they will collectively trash you. So people keep quiet. Many producers and directors in Bollywood will confirm this. Many know this, for those new here. \n1) 3 Idiots was based on my novel Five Point Someone and my story. \n2) The film won every story award that year.\n3) I was not given any of those story awards. They took them all.\n4) As a powerless newcomer I was bullied and was deeply affected They got away to a degree because social media wasn\u2019t that active as it is right now. Now, no chance in hell. Am overwhelmed at the support. https://t.co/GgOZFrhe9j Exhibit IV: snob and elitist critic. \n\nI didn\u2019t take any names. Why did he get  triggered? Is talentless and served masters.  Yet as a eco system warrior believes he can comment on someone way more educated and self made. Why? Angrezi sir. https://t.co/4i2gM4rW9P Don\u2019t know if I ever thanked you properly for writing this @virsanghvi but thank you so much!

Because I am awesome. \nBecause I threaten the elitist ecosystem. \nIf I win, any Indian can win. What will the elitists do then?\n\nAnd yes, none of these haters have been able to write one worthwhile engaging page in their life. https://t.co/2JaisHpoxT Absolutely bro. Did you read the fair and sensible? Dirty tricks are not a part of your patronising questions btw. https://t.co/TGu4gMxQar Your bio tells who you have worked for before. Interesting. Anyway, I have not threatened anyone. I am simply addressing snobs and elitists and telling them not to play dirty. Again, read sensibly. Don't get rattled. https://t.co/IrcPMjkV1w One tweet and the whole eco-system gets rattled. I am obviously not holding her responsible. But she kept quiet then and is pontificating to me now. You know words like uncouth, doesn't automatically mean you understand what I said. https://t.co/jbTTpFrj4n Elitist snob Exhibit 3:\n\nNormally, this guy would be talking about the importance of mental health. But has no issues writing this about me in public, because his ilk allows that.\nAlso, again a talentless person who can't write one engaging paragraph certifying India's #1 writer. https://t.co/e09s85Kl31 Elitist snob exhibit II\n\nAnother talentless person who knows English hence feels entitled certifying and commenting crap on the #1 writer in the country.\n\nPS: Sorry, enough of being told to be modest. I am freaking awesome. Especially compared to these talentless people. https://t.co/T2rMR98eYM This tweet is only directed to the snob and elitist critics. So you can guess who is getting triggered by it. I only said be fair and sensible. Don't try dirty tricks. Why are they getting upset?\n\nPS: I do like fair, regular, down to earth critics and often read their work. https://t.co/HwiknublQu Ma'am, when your husband publicly bullied me, shamelessly collected all the best story awards, tried denying me credit for my story and drove me close to suicide, and you just watched, where was your discourse? https://t.co/CeVDT2oq47 RT @anupamachopra: Each time you think the discourse can\u2019t get lower, it does! https://t.co/yhkBUd8VSQ Elitist snobbery: Exhibit I\n\nTalentless, mean spirited people who only had the fortune of learning English and grew up in an English speaking environment and now feel superior and constantly mock other Indians. These are the people responsible for creating a bullying culture. https://t.co/i6elepl5He Many excellent film critics on radio, YouTube and blogs but are not given as much importance as phony, la-di-da English speaking ones. \n\nThe British left in 1947. Just FYI. Dear stars,\n\nYou make tens, maybe hundreds of crores. A country of a billion people loves you. Isn't that enough? Do you really need validation from phony, English speaking evil critics, who caused mental health issues leading to a star's death? Stop patronizing them, please. 'Maa kasam, mazaa aa gaya aapki mast picture dekh ke.'\n\n'Holy heavens. I was in ecstasy watching your sublime movie.'\n\nBoth lines essentially mean the same. But most Indians, even biggest stars want to hear the second. Hence,the vile critics became important.\n\nPut an end to this. Indians love validation from people who speak good English. It's the ultimate compliment. That's where some critics built profile. They spoke good English but were evil people. Stop looking at them for validation. They are brown outside - white inside people who hate Indians. There is one critic who tried to destroy my career and spew venom on everything I'm associated with. He also tried his best to sink Sushant. His main hates a)self made people b) less anglicized more desi people and c)confident small town Indians. I beg stars not to patronize him. To the media organizations who hire these snob critics - it's an awful business strategy to hire elitists who don't understand India and think they are better than Indians. These brown outside - white inside people will ensure your organization goes bankrupt. Many have already. Sushant's last film releases this week. I want to tell the snob and elitist critics right now, write sensibly. Don't act oversmart. Don't write rubbish. Be fair and sensible. Don't try your dirty tricks. You have ruined enough lives. Now stop. We'll be watching. The entertainment industry is so tough that mere survival is a huge victory. Everyone has their own journey. Assigning grades to people is only creating unnecessary anxiety and pressure. You managed to survive? To me, you are a star. Other people apart from actors work in a movie too, and play crucial parts in making a film. The way they are treated matters too.

Why disease recedes in some places but grows in others.\n2. Why outbreaks happen only in certain parts of country and not in others (for eg USA)\n3. Why death rate is so different worldwide\n4. Why cases don't explode in reopened places. The USA is dealing with a lot of other issues right now. Corona seems to have suddenly taken a backseat there. No longer being discussed or feared like four weeks ago. At some point, governments all over the world may realize that babysitting the population, taking away their livelihoods and crashing the economy was not the best way to deal with this. Especially when the so-called experts change their minds about this every week. Apple Music today. Paused to make a point.

Can any individual Indian state prevent people from entering or leaving its boundaries even if the Centre has approved it? For instance for flights and trains? It is wrong to judge state CMs only on Corona cases. \n\nDoing so makes them care only about that and not about the national economy. \n\nThere is a lot more going on and needs attention in the state and country besides Corona anyway.

Atma-nirbhar is great. \n\nBut if you are nirbhar on protectionist policies to survive, you are obviously not atma-nirbhar. \n\nYou are only atma-nirbhar when you have great quality and productivity, so you can compete and survive in any environment against anyone in the world. Self reliance should not mean forcing consumers to buy lo quality products. \n\nSelf reliance should mean making Indian products so good  in quality that they are chosen over others. Self-reliance is great. \n\nBut self-reliance should mean world class, ready to compete with anyone. \n\nNot protectionism. Not crony capitalism. Not discrimination.  \n\nSelf-reliance should mean excellence, quality and productivity. That\u2019s what will create wealth and make India rise.

Let's fight Corona as one country. Corona is a global problem. \n\nJudging Indian state govt performance based on the statewide no of cases is not okay. \n\nEvery state is different in terms of people distribution, globalization, temperature etc etc. \n\nEven in USA, New York state has 345,000+ cases, Alaska has 379. great pic to wake up to. thanks for sharing. god bless them \ud83d\ude07 https://t.co/SjwdEqY3kR @vikramchandra Thank you so much Vikram! @nairsameer @sunilalagh thanks so much Sameer! @durgaraghunath thank u so much Durga!

Overtaxing something:\n1. creates black market\n2. makes the industry uncompetitive\n3. makes investors scared\n4. adds to individual's burden for no fault\n5. makes India less competitive vs rest of the world\n6. is unfair Whatever your moral stance on alcohol, it is silly to judge people buying a legally permitted product. If the crowd was too much, says something about the way the sales and supplies are managed/conducted too.\nAlcohol is giving revenue to states today, your moral lectures aren't. On one hand we invite foreign investments saying India is a great place to do business, on the other we massively raise taxes on a product category to a massive level based on some morality or random justification.\n\nInvestors hate unpredictability in policy.

Hi Guys, thank you so much for the birthday wishes.  Life is strange. Thought will be announcing my new book on my birthday and then literally, the world shut down.

Some acknowledgement of hardship,  relief measures expected, area wise calibration too. Biggest thing is Corona has been relatively kept under control vs globally. \nA comprehensive eco package still awaited, but overall happy with govt's handling of crisis. @aastalks thank u bro, take all precautions, but be optimistic!

Think about florists. \ud83e\udd40\ud83d\ude22 To fund the massive fiscal costs of a rescue plan, the government could issue special crisis bonds, with a 10, 20, 30 year duration. Many people are likely to invest in them. Relying on charity and benevolence is not the way to handle a crisis like this. All that looks good on social media, but this needs a massive fiscal plan, far and beyond what charity, NGOs and requests can achieve. \n\nThe poor need help. In massive doses. The upper middle class and above:\nThere's nothing left to watch on Netflix.\n\nThe poor:\nThere's nothing left to eat.\n\n#LockdownEffect Every one is suffering. \nBut the affluent, upper middle class suffer less.\n\nThe poor suffer a lot more, to the point of survival. And they aren't on social media.\n\nEvery lockdown related decision should be taken with care, balanced, calibrated  and with reason as well as emotion Some people say the world will change even after lockdown ends and all this Corona stuff becomes okay. People won\u2019t travel as much.\nDon\u2019t know about others. But I plan to travel more than ever, whenever I can, because you never know what will happen tommorrow. @MRINAAL_BISHT Just focus on your work and keep going.

Do you personally see YOUR income/ job/ business/ salary likely to be negatively affected by the Coronavirus? 31% more worried about Corona. \n22% more worried about Economy/Jobs.\n40% equally worried about both.\n\nThe economy matters and plenty are beginning to think so.

Precautions do. @mindTumult @NetNazigiri have explained this in my previous tweets about Italian cases. Please go through. Total cases is what can infect. The %growth trend is extremely important. if it goes to zero, means no new cases. if it stays constant it's exponential growth. i do know what i am talking about. Between Corona and the Economy/Unemployment, what are you more worried about? Given what you know now, how anxious are you about the whole Corona situation? Italy (first out of control Euro country) update:\nFrom 23% daily new case growth 11-March, to just 2.8% new growth yesterday. Absolute cases falling too. \nRest of Europe shows similar trends.\n\nUS numbers high, but recovery should happen soon.\n\nGo Corona Go by May2020 hopefully! https://t.co/ieJ7sIt10e I wonder if the world locks down cigarettes and junk food, how many lives would we save each year?

In a matter of weeks If New Daily Growth Rate continues to fall, and ultimately goes to near zero, cases peak and with recoveries ultimately decline. \nCrazy infection numbers assume constant exponential growth rate, which isn't really happening anywhere on a sustained basis. Italian New Cases Daily Growth continues to decline, 4 days in a row, and now only at 4.1% vs 15% 10 days ago. Italy was what created worldwide panic, and seems to be getting under control.

India temperatures, way higher: 30-20 C range, and going to get hotter. https://t.co/DXmMjuw3el Data suggest no hot country has had a massive number of cases yet, even though the virus is there in all countries.\n\nLimited evidence on temperature vs virus, but there is definitely some effect.\n\nCorona, hoping you wouldn't survive the Indian summer. Few things can. US employment data just came out. \n\nLast week: 282k\nThis week: 3.28 million!\n\nThe previous record in 2008 recession was 665k. \n\n3million jobs lost in the US in a week! \n\nThat\u2019s the next crisis we need to be prepared for here as well. Why do police beat or are cruel to poor people up already suffering from the lockdown?\n\nAre they so diligent about their duty and fighting the Coronavirus?\n\nIs there a power trip they get in being violent?\n\nHas someone told them to?\n\nThey like it?\n\nGenuinely confused. https://t.co/CWOGvJuG45 Please look into genuine issues like this. https://t.co/T7lua0D4OK Good move by FM to announce 1.7lakh crore package to help the poor. \n\nNobody knows where this will go, or if more steps will be needed, but this is a good move. #readmore \ud83d\ude01 https://t.co/H57NLRGOlq \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd17 https://t.co/h9gMacEYng Great compilation - data and examples. Please go through.\n\nWhat India is going through with this lockdown is unique - this is not happening in developed countries with shutdowns.\n\nIndia needs special steps urgently. We can\u2019t merely copy-paste developed country lockdown templates. https://t.co/QqO0HzERtp Positive news update: Italian new cases growth vs previous day continues to fall, now at 7.5% vs 23% per day 2 weeks ago. https://t.co/j75MJKZtRL If we can send planes across the world to bring citizens back, surely we can find a way to make daily wagers reach their villages - which is better than walking hundreds of kilometers.\n\nMaybe some innovation? Disposable plastic/latex suits + special buses? The real test of a society is during tough times. If we are kind, compassionate and patient; if we can care and be nice to each other; we will survive this. This is a test, not just to fight the virus, but to see the kind of people we are. Am amazed thinking like this exists. https://t.co/jd7miC0a8l Celebrities, NGOs, citizens should and will come forward to do their bit for those affected by the lockdown. Appreciate that.\n\nHowever, the problem on hand is far bigger in scale than to be handled by good samaritans alone. Comprehensive national level plan needed asap. Execution.\n\nNo matter how great the plan is, it all comes down to the execution. \n\nIf execution involves the most impoverished being hurt the most, something is not right. The real solution, apart from lockdown, will come if there is extensive testing, isolation of cases and their contacts. A lot of trust and co-operation is needed. If authorities and police show brutality, people will hide information and make the exercise counter productive. Are their numbers/addresses/methods on how daily wage labor is getting their payments from states? Or is it automatic. Please do share the process. Will help spread and encourage others to. A lockdown only buys time. \nOther steps are must to prevent spread post lockdown.\nExtensive testing, isolating cases and contact tracing are must.\n\nNot me saying it. The WHO head is. Watch full video here:https://t.co/DgJkvuYtGr The US is planning a $2 trillion stimulus package to compensate for Corona impact. That's Rs 150 lakh crores.\n\nWe can't spend that much. But our per-capita income is 1/30th of USA. \n\nOn that account, we need at least Rs 5 lakh crores. My salute to all those state governments who have announced payments to daily wagers. They are really suffering. \n\nRequest other parts of the country to follow \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb . My lockdown resolutions:\na. Eat healthier\nb. Read more\n\nYours? Lockdown positives:\n1. No traffic\n2. Don\u2019t have to meet the boss\n3. Can dress silly all day\n4. Can sleep more. \n5. Can watch as much screen\n6. Can avoid people u didn\u2019t want to meet. \n7. Helping the nation and the world\n8. The virus gets contained! Don\u2019t call it lockdown. Call it Staycation. \n\nAm on a 21 day staycation. Today is day 1. \n\nSounds much better right? Try a new diet. \nMake a business plan. \nCall old friends and talk. \nPaint. Sing. Upload a video. \nMake a life plan. \nCook. Dance. Write. Play indoor games with family. \nNo pressure to perform. Just be. \nCome to think of it, these 21 days can be beautiful and just what u needed! Don\u2019t see it as a lockdown. See it as a chance to focus 21 days on something you have been meaning to do, but never got around to it otherwise. \n\nYou can waste this time. Or you can create magic. Use it wisely. \ud83d\udd10 \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3 \ud83d\udd10 My thoughts and prayers tonight with the poor people of India - the daily wagers who will suffer the most next 3 weeks. \n\nPoverty is a disease, and in times like these one can tell why. \n\nHope the authorities and police are kind to them \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\n #lockdown21 The lockdown is painful. \n\nBut don\u2019t try to game it. \n\nDon\u2019t keep roaming around carrying a milk packet in your hand for instance, saying I came out to get milk. \n\nIndians are very good at this gaming and jugaad but don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s for your own good. \n\n#lockdown21 Too many doubts in people\u2019s minds. Need to be clarified. Hearing reports of people running to hoard essentials. There\u2019s no need. Essentials are still available and okay. Please don\u2019t panic #lockdown21 The toughest 21 days India has ever faced. #Lockdown21 long but v interesting read. https://t.co/jGmyWGcOBY Instagram stories about my books have increased 3-4x since last week. Am sure same happening for other books too.\n\nPeople are reading more. And that's good. :) The guards who have to reach swanky buildings but have no public transport are not on twitter.\n\nNeither are roadside sellers, maids, uber drivers with EMIs, restaurant staff and auto drivers.\n\nWhile lockdown is important, we must do something for those affected the most as well. Amidst the gloom, here's what I feel is definitely good news. \n\nOne v imp global metric: Daily New Italian Cases growth is falling, for 4 consecutive days now, down to 8% from 23% less than 2-weeks ago. \n\nExponential growth assumptions therefore won't apply.\n\nSee chart and share. https://t.co/yRx2myj8bl Corona will drive Indian economy to the wall. \n\nThe only positive, is like 1991, we will have to finally act on reforms. \n\nCoz when it comes to economy, we are like \u201cunless it\u2019s smashed to pieces, why fix it?\u201d\n\nIt will be smashed to pieces. We are doing it right now. Sensex hovering at mid-2014 levels. Wiping out 6 years of gains. \nRupee all time low. \n\nI know people think this is not the priority right now or this won\u2019t directly affect them. But it will.\nIt surely will. \nBecause lockdowns have a bill. How economic crisis will flow:\nTourism + Hospitality + Travel + Retail --&gt; Real estate --&gt; Banks --&gt; Credit slowdown --&gt; All Industry --&gt; job losses --&gt; demand down --&gt; recession\n\nSolution:\nMassive, massive opening up of the economy post Covid, even more reforms than 1991. \u0936\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e! https://t.co/r5i8hSsdqC \"If we live, then we will think about jobs,\" is the common sentiment at the moment, justifying stricter and stricter measures (usually by people who have the power to sustain themselves without work for a while).\n\nLet's see if that sentiment remains in 2 weeks. If only there was a count of the number of jobs lost alongside the total number of cases. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udd14\n\nTo everyone working in healthcare, directly or indirectly, thank you! \n\n\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udd14 \ud83d\udd14 Thanks! https://t.co/tf5n1xMZwS Thanks! https://t.co/SeF2zkpZrW Thank you.

Do consider. https://t.co/7vBAjYi0vN Finally, we learnt to value and appreciate our doctors. Interesting global total cases graph, on log scale. \nThe first pic shows initial massive growth and then a flattening end Feb. However, since March growth began again. \nOnly this time, the March slope is less steep than earlier. Good news?\nOther math enthusiasts, your opinion? https://t.co/xJzC5j8Fb1 Study. Cook. Clean. Talk to family. Call old friends. Watch TV. Surf the net. Exercise at home. Meditate. Sleep. Rest. Eat. Shower. Repair something broken. Rearrange cupboards. Organise your paperwork. Write down your goals. \n\nPlenty you can do. Have a great #JuntaCurfew day! Exponential functions: assuming 20% daily growth. \n\nDay 0: 1\nDay 1: 1.2x\nDay 20: 38x\nDay 40: 1,470x\nDay 60: 56,347x\nDay 80: 21.6 million x\n\nThat\u2019s why you need to act fast, and hard. Just learnt that even though supporters of political parties hate on each other all day long on Twitter, the senior leaders of these parties love to hang out and party together, even in times of a virus! So much love! Don\u2019t party for a few days. Please. Things that can be done in this time (apart from just chilling):\n1. Working out using exercise videos\n2.  Resetting your diet\n3.  Contemplating  life/ career and if you need to change anything. \n4. Doing an online course. \n5. Making a plan for next 12 months once things improve. To be at home.\nTo do nothing.\nTo just be on social media.\nAnd yet, somehow, be helping the world.\n\nThe ultimate fantasy of a generation has come true. always an option :). reading has definitely increased these days. https://t.co/tChN6Pa5UI Try to use the time productively. The virus is going to take its time and all governments are doing their best to fight it. Getting hourly updates on the virus is not helpful.\nUsing this time for self-growth is. Airlines. Hotels. Restaurants. Events. Retail. Sectors getting whacked so badly, many players will be bankrupt and cutting massive amounts of jobs in a few weeks. The world is reacting to the virus on a day by day basis, with steps that are short-term at best. Meanwhile, economies are getting wrecked around the world and we don\u2019t know if we are solving the problem or simply postponing it. Never before has a disease come where the number of cases is shared like live cricket scores. Don\u2019t know if such an overload of info helps or makes anxiety levels worse. The economic contraction, bankruptcies and job losses to come scare me just as much as the virus. Fear kills the mind far more than the virus kills people. so many corona memes \ud83d\ude48 @NetflixIndia 2 States\nHalf Girlfriend\n\n:) I encourage everyone to read this fantastic  interview of Micheal Levitt, a Nobel prize winner and Stanford prof. \n\nHe discusses why Covid won't grow exponentially.\n\n\"if you consider your own social circle, you basically meet the same people every day\"\n\nhttps://t.co/dmW53IBwJ7 Countries where daily new cases dropped/are dropping:\n-China\n-South Korea\n- UK and Italy (last couple of days)\n \nWhere daily new cases still rising fast:\n- US, Spain, France\n\nAfter an exponential rise, there is/will be a plateau.

But if you want it to work, make it complete. \n\nHalf measures won't work. They only give the psychological relief 'something is being done about it.' Theatres and malls closed. Cafes and bars shut. \n\nMetro open. Trains open. Airports open. Flights open. \n\nIt's not like #coronavirus attacks you more when you are having fun.

Appreciate it. @UnSubtleDesi Thanks for sharing your opinion and advice. I respect that. @UnSubtleDesi I just wanted to listen. Not retract or make anyone retract or anything confrontational. Nothing has been proven.Again that\u2019s an opinion. also felt u were unnecessarily rude and personal. maybe u didn\u2019t mean to.Anyway you guys supported me in the past and just wanted to thank you @UnSubtleDesi I honestly wanted your take on it. Because I like to listen to people who differ from my view and engage with different opinions. But I hoped for a specific response. To the points I raised. Maybe another time. @UnSubtleDesi That said. I do admire the work you and your team do. Please do respect other opinions and people who might differ with you on an issue. Also remember bringing others down is not necessary to make your point. May you and your team do really well. @UnSubtleDesi Nupur you lack the ability to respond to specific points in my column. And so you are going in circles and making personal attacks. That\u2019s exactly what people do when they don\u2019t have proper arguments. It\u2019s ok. I get it. U have a good day now. Take care. @UnSubtleDesi You are free to write it. Yes. But Damn. How did you know? Must be all the monkey screams. @UnSubtleDesi Yes Nupur ji. I give an opinion only on an opinions page. @UnSubtleDesi I am giving an opinion. On the opinion page of a newspaper. I thought that\u2019s pretty obvious. Anyway, don\u2019t think you are up for a point wise specific response. So let it be. God bless. @UnSubtleDesi We can\u2019t be factual about an exercise that\u2019s not happened. Even if you do include some facts, it still will have an element of opinion in it. Like your assertion about what I deserve is also an opinion. Upto you. If you want to respond or not. @UnSubtleDesi I think nobody needs to retract. We can let both our opinions be there. And I can acknowledge yours and you can acknowledge mine. Thanks. Shall wait then. Do read. Especially if you support it. And with folded hands, request you to read it fully and then respond on specific points. And be polite. Please. https://t.co/aH28RGgMy2 Thanks https://t.co/xf6oDmthbJ @UnSubtleDesi Can you please go through the column and counter the points logically than lamenting on the opportunities I worked hard to get or making personal attacks.

Do share with as many Indians as you can. \n\nhttps://t.co/KvQfvuYwAJ If we can just brush the Hindu-Muslim issues aside for  next 20 years, and focus on growing the economy, we can easily reach $10,000 per capita GDP by 2040.\n \nThen we can fight all we want.\n\nBut my guess is, when incomes reach that level, we won't fight like this. Inflation: 6-year high\n\nGDP growth: 6-year low\n\nThis needs to be our number one priority. The rest of the never ending and somewhat pointless identity politics stuff can wait. AAP changed its way of working dramatically last 2 years.\n\nThey listened to the criticism and acted on it. \n\nThey are now leading in opinion polls in Delhi.\n\nIf they win, scaling up outside Delhi will become a possibility again. Ultimately no matter what posturing people do, every issue on Twitter boils down to do you like Modi or not. Effect of 99% cutoffs? A bunch of \u201csmart\u201d kids who are very good at pointing errors but miss the overall point. Ma\u2019am ma\u2019am college nahi university hai. Oh so bright u are. The essence of the statement doesn\u2019t change and you didn\u2019t get it but here, take ur \u201cI am right badge\u201d. Two big dates coming up\n\nFeb 1: Budget. Will show how serious we are about the economy. \n\nFeb 11: Delhi election results. Some indication of the political impact of recent events. \n\nIndia may be whatever, but it is never boring. JNU is just one college.\n\nThere are nearly 40,000 colleges in India.\n\nI understand it is important. But there is a limit to how much importance and attention one college gets.\n\nThere are more important issues in a country of 1.2bn people I am sure. I am going to disappoint everyone who thinks I am in a camp. People in India understand serving someone. Our faulty education makes people incapable of thinking for themselves. They find it hard to deal with independent minds with different opinions in different situations. But you were that side na? No, your brain was limited. Still is. @seemay \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 I wish GDP had a religion so more people would care for it.\nI wish healthcare was fought for like we fight for our traditions.\nI wish scientific education was valued like our scriptures.\nI wish the country\u2019s infrastructure was built like places of worship, with as much pride. I wish GDP had a religion so a lot more people would care for it. There\u2019s a lot of value in simplifying things. \n\nIt is not that simple to be simple. Saying \u201cNRC will definitely come\u201d and then saying \u201cbut did I show u details yet?\u201d\n\n is like saying\n\n\u201cyou will have to marry where I ask you to\u201d  and then saying \u201cbut did I show you any boys yet?\u201d\n\nBe clear. If it is not coming, shelve it. Restore peace and order. The NRC is unimplementable due to massive execution issues. \n\nTime to put it to rest. Not the right time at all. \n\nWith growing US-Iran tensions, higher oil prices and our already weak economy, we need to do everything we can to restore stability. Many people have invited or welcomed me to their club given my recent specific views on a specific issue. \n\nNeither was I a member of the other club. Nor would I like to be of yours. \n\nSure, happy to have a cup of tea now and then in either club. \n\nBut Life membership? No thanks. Stand up for what you feel is right, that\u2019s all. \n\nWhatever you think is the right thing for your country. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to agree with my view or anyone else\u2019s. \n\nBut just make sure it is your view. You have thought through it and is not coming out of blind fandom or hate. All the best to \n@deepikapadukone @masseysahib\n @meghnagulzar and the entire team of #Chhapaak !

Can\u2019t let a country burn to save ego. Deeply, deeply concerned about the #JNUAttacks.\n\nThey are Indian students. In an Indian college.\n\nIt\u2019s not ok to attack or make any Indian college feel unsafe.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t change even if the college is AMU, Jamia or JNU.\n\nWe destroy our nation if we do or secretly condone this. \u201cIndia\u2019s Goal for decade: $5,000 per capita GDP by 2030,\u201d my Col in ToI today. \n\nShare with as many Indians as possible.

Why is an law like CAA, technically meant for foreigners affecting Indians so much?\n\nCause another law called NRC is coming, which essentially assumes all Indians are foreigners unless they can prove otherwise. \n\nThis needs to be fixed. CAA is a life jacket. \n\nNRC is everyone being pushed out of the plane as they have to prove themselves all over again. \n\nBut Muslims don\u2019t  get the life jacket. \n\nDistributing life jackets is not the problem. Giving them only to a few and pushing everyone off the plane is. CAA by itself not the issue.\nBut CAA+NRC is discriminatory.

I am on India\u2019s side. And am proud of that. Crashing the economy. Making jobs vanish. Shutting down Internet. Sending police in libraries. The youth may have patience, but don\u2019t test the limits of it. The youth is angry. There are not enough jobs. Salaries are low. Don\u2019t mess with them. The first priority should be to lift the economy back again. The CAB required more education, more consensus building, a lot better wording and frankly better intentions. Stirring the social pot constantly is going to hurt us and the already weak economy. Repeated and prolonged Internet shutdowns hurt business and the economy. Sends a message that we are an unpredictable, third-world country where things are not under control. Even non-democratic China never did it during Hong Kong protests. Lagta hai Delhi mein elections aane wale hain. People opposing CAB are those who want to include nobody and those who want to include everybody. Pollution or protest, it has to reach Delhi, else it doesn\u2019t seem to matter. Kashmir matters. Assam matters. Tripura matters. Internet shutdowns, in this era of online dependence for everyday life, should be avoided. If at all, they can be done on an exceptional basis for a very short time duration to diffuse a situation. To make it a way of life is draconian. Kashmir matters. Tripura matters. Assam matters. Shutting down Internet doesn\u2019t shut down the resentment. 3 tips to be more successful. https://t.co/hOeklYyhN5 Do you wanna partner.. o partner..\n\nGuess who I met today!

Not applying labels or picking sides. Am not commenting on the specifics of CAB yet. Excluding anyone is not good. Just need to define such situations like you mention better. https://t.co/RD0e6nLFvq The CAB needs to be read and fully understood before commented upon. Plan to do the same. Meanwhile, there is no doubt we need a good refugee policy.  Drafting and executing one is not simple at all. In all this, There is no doubt India was, is, and must remain a secular republic We were, are and will always remain a secular nation. However, if India won\u2019t shelter oppressed Hindus from around the world, who will? Any Hindu oppressed anywhere in the world for their religion is welcome to make India their home. India is home to this great religion and it will always protect it. So cool. Learning through video games.

Is a measure of value you provide, though not the only one\n4. Is hard to earn, harder to keep and grow\n5. Is not everything. Happiness comes from:\n1. Doing work you love\n2. Having 3-4 people in life who really care\n3. A healthy body, a decent diet\n4. Enough sleep\n5. Avoiding negativity at all costs. Time management (practically doing it):\n1. Cut your phone screen time (most people are 5hrs+, get to 2)\n2. Make to-do lists for next day the night before\n3. Don't waste time on bad relationships and useless work\n4. End of day, ask, how did I get closer to my goal today? 3 things that make a big difference to your success (not dependent on talent)\n1. Having clear goals- where you want to be by when\n2.

Issues are tough but still in resolvable state, if all stakeholders act swiftly. Interesting to see how this develops. Has wider implications for Indian economy. Yes Bank needs a staggering $1bn-$2bn in new capital to keep running. All this, while it deals with bad news, massive stock declines, black box loan book, plummeting confidence and promoter already having sold stake. It is not easy at all to raise that kind of money. Happened with Kingfisher. Happened with Jet. When trouble begins, Indian procedures are so slow and cumbersome that recovery is v difficult. Confidence crisis makes it worse.

Sir your entire country is a human rights violation. Please focus on improving that. Would you like it if we peeked in your internal matters? https://t.co/ZXqJJa9EO9 The major liberal-elitist-Lutyens types objection to Article 370 isn\u2019t that it was removed or how it was done.

Sir you have the right to your views but 1) 370 was removed by an elected parliament, after the region failed to be fixed. comparing it to Babri mob is incorrect. 2) Babri caused riots, we r trying to prevent them right now.

Given the current situation in @INCIndia, will Sachin Pilot be one of the better choices than older veterans to take over as Cong President? Whatever happens @INCIndia, think about the people of this country and what is best for them. The time for change has come. Don't be afraid to embrace it. And serve this great nation. @milinddeora @SachinPilot @JM_Scindia \"The best bet right now seems to be Sachin Pilot,\" had said this in Feb-18. And the time has now come to see what @INCIndia does. I know for a fact that many young leaders of the @INCINdia will be happy with and will back @SachinPilot   https://t.co/torLIxHoD3 Have been mentioning @SachinPilot 's name since a long time now as the possible new face for the Congress. He still seems to be the best bet in current situation https://t.co/QHcXZ6mVx0 Dear @INCIndia the next few days are crucial for your future. Accept the new reality and choose a leader who gives you the best chance to reform for the future. Yes. Despite being one of the strong leaders in the Congress, @capt_amarinder is smart enough to realize that the new leader needs to be someone who can win and connect, and is not just a matter of seniority. https://t.co/0yZvuTzEqe \ud83d\ude4f https://t.co/WW0yV40Yce \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude01 https://t.co/By0D2DvwyC There are so many good writers.

This will lead to us no longer having the best doctors we can have and will aggravate the healthcare crisis further. I support India's doctors, who are amongst the best in the world. They work tirelessly, often to compensate for an inadequate healthcare system. Still they are judged, threatened, shamed for trying to make decent living and their genuine issues aren't heard. #SupportIndianDoctors The kind of pic that makes my day. New India.

It is important we remain calm and stick to proper sources for our information. https://t.co/gQB1kXecGE Reacting when our soldiers are killed isn't war mongering, it is self defence. Nobody in India wants war. We were happily waiting for the next Bollywood film or cricket match before they backed a terror attack at Pulwama. They did it first. We had no choice but to teach a lesson. Great job by the IAF. And great choice of words by govt \"non-military preemptive action against terrorists (and not against Pak)\". Makes it difficult for Pak to escalate. Josh and Hosh both on display. Very well done. #IndianAirForce #IndiaStrikesBack When you slap us, we will no longer turn the other cheek.

More than anything I just want me and my family to be left alone and people to ignore fake charges.  Love to all who supported me. I won\u2019t let you down. This was my #MeToo story. Peace out. Annoyed by my revelations, more baseless, twisted attacks may come on me, through her friends, wellwishers &amp;/or others. Neither obligated nor inclined to respond. Please don\u2019t believe such nonsense. I may go silent on twitter to heal my family but I won\u2019t be shamed or silenced. To those who abused me last few days, hope you will do right by me now. Ultimately, is this movement about the truth or blindly supporting a particular gender? Please don\u2019t let your biases make you believe things that are not true. A person\u2019s reputation is their most prized asset and takes a lifetime of work to earn. To have these motivated, fake attacks on me is abhorrent and the sickest thing a person can do. Please don\u2019t support this kind of smear campaign. Shame on media like @outlookindia who carried a fake charges story without even checking with me. They could have easily checked on YouTube that I launched her book in 2015/16. Who calls their harasser as chief guest for their book launch? Video here: https://t.co/g6uIOVLjeS Also, it is she who comes from very powerful family connected to pol party (regularly dropped top names of people in power then ). i was less known in 2010. was intimidated by her. My old col on Air India talks of entitled IAS kid demanding upgrades at Air India counter. It's her https://t.co/GGNGjZgbz9 So who wanted to kiss whom? @iratrivedi\u2019s self-explanatory email from 2013 to me, esp last line, easily shows her claims from 2010 are false, and she knows this too. This mental harassment of me and my family has to stop. Please don\u2019t harm a movement with #fakecharges #harassed https://t.co/SWeaSCfHLd Thank you for all the love for #TheGirlinRoom105.

It is people like you I write for. Welcome to wonderful world of books. Yes there\u2019s tons of suspense. Thank u! https://t.co/3baqv8RQ5K @jubouissou Great job Julien. ... I still remember https://t.co/oGjQdpX6qQ @donaldsvd @KabirHu58453370 i didn't ask you to.. but again u never really defended your point. so was just a random opinion. @donaldsvd @KabirHu58453370 not defending anything. again try to back up your opinions with something substantial. i like that mithai tweet, got a great response. neither was this tweet any kind of defense. if u want to be taken seriously please back up your claims. @YashMirchawala coz if u bother to click the link u will see it is #1 bestseller in india. thanks. @santy_a14 it is meant for the BJP, who face the music now. they can't wish it away and the political optics are bad. that's what i said and saying it again. like i said, there was no bias. scrapping deal also means BJP faces music and can't wish it away. hope u get it. @santy_a14 @BJP4India @INCIndia yes its just an opinion. the tone is pretty strong, maybe i am not matching your emotion but that doesn't make me biased. i prefer to know all the facts before raising my tone. chill. just don't accuse without reason or without backing up claims The Girl in Room 105: #1 National Bestseller already on pre-orders alone!

Can you explain? Or your own biases are at play here? @santy_a14 i really don't know what is the bias in my statement? pls back your statement with some facts and not just random opinions. In all the cacophony, we may never really know whatever happened in Rafale. However, the political optics of having a name like Ambani on a defense deal are just bad. And now you can't wish it away. Mr PM considering you wanted to be a beacon of peace, don\u2019t you think you needed to be more patient than attacking the moment things didn\u2019t go your way? Our people were killed, difficult to do a hugs session the day that happened isn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t give up if u r serious about peace https://t.co/uIABdqjvQU Explaining thing in layman terms doesn\u2019t make you a layman. In fact, it requires a level of clarity and understanding to be able to do so. Relax. Am just giving an analogy so people understand the deal and in a lighter vein. Divert your anger somewhere else. https://t.co/DCrvrHQzqt I like to simplify issues so maximum number of people understand it. Those who hide behind complex arguments know their hollowness pretty well. Remember, it is not that simple to be simple. This elitist arrogance is an example of people who don\u2019t want issues to be simplified or get more people involved in a debate. Because you know, only they the so-called intellectuals must own and debate issues. Please ignore such bullies and discuss issues however you want. https://t.co/1aIs7EjfwL Interesting take.

Read the full interview here: https://t.co/lQZ1dzfX\u2026 Trying to understand the Rafale situation better. There are just too many versions at the moment. Any genuine suggestions on some good articles to read on the same? Be civil please and do share the links. Sometimes when info is not adequate or conflicting the best thing to say is we don\u2019t have enough to form a view rather than jump to conclusions. This is a developing situation, better to be patient and see what everyone has to say. https://t.co/yaWHsp0nyP #RafaelDeal simplified analogy. Say you order mithai for the neighbourhood, but tell the halwai to take the milk from your bhaiya only. Did someone actually say that? Was milk taken at a fair price? Did halwai choose the milk seller on his own based on quality? We don\u2019t know yet. So now current French govt says something else vs. what ex-French prez Hollande said on the #RafaelDeal. Looks like their politics is just as complicated as ours. With so many versions and few clarifications, impossible to form a view on this at this point. Indian Government Chose Anil Ambani For Rafale, with no choice - Says ex-French Prez Francois Hollande, according to news reports.   This is a serious charge and about time our government verified and clarified this, and did it fast. That is a tough question.

It is a tough call and I don't really know if it will play out like that. Interesting Facts about Petrol Prices:\nCurrent Retail Price: Rs80/liter\nPrice if no central/govt taxes: Rs43/liter\nPrice if brought under GST(28%): Rs55/liter\nPrice if same taxation rates as were there in 2014: Rs63/liter\n\nTaxes have risen a lot, and are now at 84% for petrol. Most ad revenues have shifted to Facebook and Google. Media houses, no matter which govt in power, will never be as powerful as they used to be. Kudos to those who still try to be independent. We need a new term. Journotainment. Many news channels fit in that category and should be officially called so. I love u too. U r doing a great job! https://t.co/z4sUaSkh3p Why is she reacting to chota so much? Like to every tweet.  We know love is blind. https://t.co/kiBYP5vyGW @rupagulab @Neruda_Frost @kunfaaya Sad. What u have become. Refusing to listen. Stuck to your beliefs. Goats belong to herds. Not me. God bless u. RT @chetan_bhagat: Modi haters be like:\nHater: You are scared to speak on fuel prices in Modi regime\nMe: I just did that\nHater: No u didn't\u2026 @Neruda_Frost @rupagulab @kunfaaya Did u see my tweets from yest? But see v hard to admit u r wrong on twitter. U get shamed in front of ur followers. So keep repeating urself @rupagulab @Neruda_Frost @kunfaaya Rap on knuckles now? First u said he dare not. And savage or not it\u2019s all in your head. And i just proved u wrong. Do say that he criticised even tho it was a rap to your echo chamber followers. And no. Cant hate as much to win u over. @rupagulab @Neruda_Frost @kunfaaya See my tweets from yesterday. Expected better from you than to lie and high five your friends. Your choice. @szjilani @rachnaburman Name and dp were a bit confusing (she has to clarify in her bio) and apologise for the genuine error. Btw she did judge me without knowing me and my book before it even released. Maybe she needs to learn something too and u need to learn something about fairness too? @ashwaqM @RaisinaSeries See the problem? Nothing I do will shake ur confirmation bias. U prove the tweet. How sweet Self goal tweet? Am sorry. I didn\u2019t understand this graph. Can u please explain why the yellow bar is smaller in size despite value being higher?! https://t.co/8pOHmHXM0f Modi haters be like:\nHater: You are scared to speak on fuel prices in Modi regime\nMe: I just did that\nHater: No u didn't do it with as much anger\nMe: Ok, am really upset\nHater: Ok abuse Modi now, like really badly\nMe: well why should I?\nHater: see..bhakt bhakt bhakt! To many, my views on the country's fuel prices and currency movements are more important than the country's fuel prices or the currency movements themselves. Flattery comes in many forms. @swamv39 rakho sambhal ke..how sweet :) tum jaise troll sabko milein. so cool! https://t.co/KOjDx3v8VZ I can't. I could probably have a decent set of policies if in that position, but I can't win elections because I refuse to and am unable to play the identity and shady politics that is needed to win elections in India today. So, apologies. Can't. https://t.co/TydMJausbf Not at all. But screaming and shouting doesn't make you a better analyst. In fact you gain credibility by keeping a balance and using emotions selectively. Don't worry about my heart rate, which is pretty low btw. Petrol prices on the other hand..:) https://t.co/yB3nO9xtKX GST is not just a formula. It is a way of indirect taxation where the indirect tax rates r fixed and doesn't depend on someone judging the product as good/bad/luxury/essential and then setting rates like we did in the 60s. Only works if everything moves into GST - including fuel. A scam needs more data points than just mere allegations. There were CAG reports, invoices of purchases made in CWG etc etc. If that happens in this govt, it too will get scam-ridden. So far, there has not been solid basis. Just stating the situation. https://t.co/VzewJg1sFL Pointed out high fuel prices in previous regimes. Have also done it now. For those asking why I sounded angrier then, then we had high prices PLUS a scam-a-week. A student who gets lo marks as well as cheats will get scolded more than the student who just gets lo marks right? To give credit where due, she's v funny and witty :) https://t.co/ruOnlFg2RD Another contest coming up with great prizes. Tip: Watch this trailer carefully, noticing every detail. Will help you win! Watch here: The Girl in Room 105- Chetan Bhagat-  Book Trailer https://t.co/MGpaqFLMql Am all for fiscal prudence but to overtax fuel and then spend thousands of crores paying for Air India\u2019s losses and funding bank NPAs also doesn\u2019t seem to be the best way to do things. Petrol Diesel prices too high. Said it before saying it now. Taxation on fuel needs to be revisited. People are suffering. Inflation will rise. Why not just simply bring it under GST? Hi guys, read the first chapter of \u201cThe Girl in Room 105\u201d here: https://t.co/yMFAkp6TOU Remember this.

Some Q &amp; A about the book here: https://t.co/lzHUO5esfy I am sure you deserve it too sir but would request you not to malign my institute\u2019s name and the others who have won, with your allegations that have no basis. The IITs are fair, and frankly don\u2019t think the BJP cares about a college\u2019s internal awards. https://t.co/rpxM82KMKj I am sorry.

RT @ASShishism: Lucid writing, and high on impact. Good one @chetan_bhagat. You\u2019ve continued your tradition of putting forth your POV with\u2026 @saliltripathi @somakghoshal Never said otherwise. Just wanted to say it affects a lot more people than many would think. Don\u2019t assume or react to things which haven\u2019t been said please. @yash_chetan Never said otherwise. Just wanted to say it affects a lot more people than many would think. Don\u2019t assume things which haven\u2019t been said please. Survey matches scientific data. Around 10% of the population could be LGBT. That\u2019s 100mn+ people in India. Not a small number. Hence 377 verdict v important. https://t.co/UyS79tFEiN Thanks @Tutejajoginder ! https://t.co/Z6g6nibbFx Thank you Director-sir, this is such a big honour for me.

Someone should look into the same and work out a solution. https://t.co/kCp3tE9Y4D India is a country where the culture changes every 100km. Accepting diversity has to be the core value of every Indian and frankly is the only way India will survive and thrive. Scrapping #Section377 is a step in that direction. It is a good day for India. So #Section377 is decriminalized. An outdated law that needed to go. Congrats to all! For those who want to understand the issue and why it needed to be scrapped. My earlier column : \"Section 377 is our collective sin: https://t.co/DSpZcbF6CC via @TOIOpinion As SC rules on #Section377 verdict, it is important for us to know that gay community exists and suffers because of this law. How many of you, privately or openly, identity yourself as gay (individual votes are not visible to others on Twitter) Twitter discussions never work because if one is wrong on Twitter and the other side even proves it, one ends up being shamed in front of their followers. Hence, everyone remains stuck to their positions and never listens. And so the polarisation only rises. The Girl in Room 105- Chetan Bhagat-  Book Trailer https://t.co/MGpaqFubyN via @YouTube If there are people here who can think beyond whether it was the BJP or Congress\u2019 fault and think about what is actually good for the country, let me know. Would be nice to see some people who actually care about India first. Just the two tweets before the one u r replying to were on exactly that so I don\u2019t even know what to say to u or the likes of u. Is not reading and throwing statements the new cool? Just saying.. https://t.co/Zh3g2H1Reo Why do people compare Modi with Manmohan Singh? Should be with Sonia Gandhi. Have we forgotten who was in power then? Have always spoken on issues, no matter which govt at centre.Those saying otherwise are misleading you. And sorry while I do criticise govt when needed,I don\u2019t hate Modi and I can\u2019t do that to get entry into your elite club. Hope you are liberal enough to allow me to be this way. Whatever the other issues, the govt move to  create India Post Payments Bank, that seeks to leverage the infrastructure, personnel and reach of India Post is highly appreciated. Such innovative ideas is what makes the country progress. Well done. Arresting poets? Like seriously. The Rupee, although stable for last couple of years and a modest decline is expected, has fallen too much lately. While other factors remain, shows international confidence is economy is not as strong as it should be. Neither UPA nor NDA could hold Rupee strong. Sad. Petrol prices too high. Don\u2019t know why state taxes are not capped. It\u2019s almost like the states make more money when crude oil goes higher. Shouldn\u2019t it be the opposite? Sorry been a bit busy with book announcements etc to talk about national issues. It\u2019s not silence, just busy. Back now. Whatever I have achieved is due to my teachers. Just wanted to thank them all. #HappyTeachersDay Hi guys, Here is the exclusive first chapter of \u201cThe Girl in Room 105\u201d https://t.co/yMFAkp6TOU RT @YahooIndia: Chetan Bhagat Reveals \u2018Movie-Style Promo\u2019 of New \u2018Unlove Story\u2019\nhttps://t.co/b0jfzOJznz RT @Spotboye: Check out the mind-boggling trailer of @chetan_bhagat's latest book - #TheGirlInRoom105 directed by @mohit11481 &amp; features ac\u2026 Directed by Mohit Suri @mohit11481 featuring Vikrant Massey ( @masseysahib ).

It isn't the device, it is what's happening in your mind. Reading triggers your imagination. Videos do not. Just because I want to have more books and less screen doesn't mean I don't like the screen. Saying but you are typing this on a screen is also so silly. We don't need to polarise every darn thing in the world and make it into this vs that. Love screen. Love books. The screen is important. It is fun too. I love it. But books also have their place and magic. It's not books vs screen, it is making them co-exist. Lifts and escalators are great. But you will always have and need stairs.

And better to focus on real issues anyway. @EcoManOne @itimestweets it's the media! i am just shocked they could do this. @itimestweets i tweeted the HT-Neilsen list and that's factual please google and see. you should be ashamed to post this fake news. and giving a platform to trolls that make up 0.0000001% of my followers makes u one of them. that's ur parallel universe. I agree with this. Newspaper articles saying \u201ctrolls should not have said this about XYZ\u201d and then going on to give a platform to the same trolls, are unethical and sick.

See u soon Arithmetic and whether an election is multi-cornered or not matters so much in Indian elections, but is somehow not discussed as much. #bypoll The Modi wave even at its peak gave BJP a few %age points vote share lead. With the wave ebbing, and opposition uniting, simple arithmetic making it very difficult for the BJP to win in several places. Good or bad, shows what 2019 could be like for India. Appointing a Hindu religious figure as the UP CM gave opposition the legitimacy to come together for a common cause. Costing BJP dearly now in UP. Today's BJP won 1 seat in LS (out of 4) and 1 in assembly (out of 11). Almost as cruel a joke as the 1 paise reduction in petrol price. #bypoll Hey it is not 1 paisa per litre.

If you are a troll, vote and side with one party and keep screaming in their defense all day long on twitter. Hate Modi or BJP. You have the right to. But think twice before painting Congress in pure gold. Don't forget massive scams in their time, where spectrum, coal and even games weren't spared.Citizens have to make a choice during elections, but then must keep all parties accountable sweet cartoon. but my views are the same - excise duty on fuel is too high - in 2010 and in 2018. under UPA or BJP. for hindus or muslims. in summer and winter. for vegetarians and non vegetarians. for dalits and non dalits. now focus on the issue and stop ur divisive thinking https://t.co/ZPHp3UI22a @boblezley baby go learn to troll properly at least. saying the same thing. emojis don't make u cool, make u look like a fool. GST works only if everything, ALL products and services are under GST. Else it is just the govt trying to keep control that it never wants to give up - and hence we will never get the full benefits of GST to the economy. @boblezley ole baby, cute little troll..get a life..oh wait, u don't have one. @RajivGupta11 chup..bhaago chalo..u called me bhakt, that shows u r a troll. that's ur leaning. go run first it was u don't criticise BJP, now when i proved that lie it is well u do criticize them but use sober vocabulary with bjp, what else next? i don't raise my eyebrows that high when i criticize BJP? silly fools. abuse them or u aren't objective is it? https://t.co/kw4MQKuuw0 @RajivGupta11 i can't keep commenting everyday on fuel taxes or when some idiot wants me to. i do it when i want to as it is my account. i am a man and u are a small minded little troll. go get a life. Tweeted this 8 years ago. I still stand by it, no matter what regime we are in (so small minded trolls get a life, learn to focus on issues than cheer for your side.). Either way, fuel is taxed too much. It needs to come under GST frankly but for now taxes need to go down. https://t.co/Ioc1OIraNL Fuel prices depend on crude oil prices, the rupee $ exchange rate and local taxes. Both crude oil prices and $ are higher and govt has limited control on that. Hence the govt should lower the very high existing taxes on petrol and diesel. Come to India.

Why? Interesting times. Keep watching. Keep your flock together. That\u2019s all Cong and JDS have to do and there\u2019s no way BJP can pass the floor test. Nobody can break u unless some of your own allow it to happen. MLAs are not babies that someone will come and steal.

Screaming without reason spoils my credibility. 2) Have written lots on BJP's issues, 3) Have explained INR in tweets, see it, 4) Excise duties on petrol too high have said it many times we need One-GST, 5) Get a life. https://t.co/MiK23a0jLG You need to be involved and have a view, but not waste too much time on politics and develop yourself too. Are these two things that hard to understand? Does twitter blind people into black and white - this or that and both can't be?

Not according to my logic, but according to standard economic theory. Else you could borrow cheap in $ and put in high interest rate INR Fixed Deposits and make infinite amounts of money forever.

That tweet is from 2013. 60-67 is 2.2% depreciation per annum, well below $-INR interest rate differential. Think before u troll please. https://t.co/CkqSqQhoqP Yes Mahesh (and other similar trolls). It is from 2013. We are in 2018.  60 to 67 in 5years is a depreciation of 2.2% per annum, which is way lower than $-INR interest rate differential (~6% per annum) or diff in $-INR inflation rates. As a journo, read up interest rate parity. https://t.co/63TfaxGueW Stone pelting is not kids playing with pebbles. It\u2019s a violent attack with hard, heavy, rock-like stones thrown at people.

If you hire someone to clean your house doesn\u2019t mean you are selling your house to them. No, Red Fort is not being sold.

Thank you guys for still remembering the film. v close to my heart. https://t.co/qNmUi3rw8G Over 38k votes in this twitter poll. 58% believe Modi govt performance below expectations, many even calling it well below. somewhat unusual Twitter result where Modi supporters outnumber others. https://t.co/Dq9Djltg4u @shilpitewari @DurgeshILikeYou i do get that. however, there's a problematic interpretation there as well. @shilpitewari are you serious? there's no difference between a fiction title vs an official national slogan to protect women? Are you being funny? or is that how u think? #gorakhpurbypolls #NiravModi #icicibankscam #FakeNews #SCSTAct #Unnao #Kathua #CashCrunch - all these news have come right after the other, harming the BJP's image. A lot to introspect for the party. Another week with bad headlines for the BJP with #CashCrunch, after #Kathua and #Unnao which was after #SCSTAct.  Bad times for the BJP. Bura Waqt. All those fundamentalists, pray harder you guys. There used to be dry days for alcohol. Now there are dry days for cash. #CashCrunch Oh dear. Is this what they meant by cashless society? People can\u2019t lay hands on their own money? https://t.co/VnccG5ehiL In your honest opinion, compared to what you expected in 2014, the performance of the Modi govt has been: To you, and all who think like you. I don't have change of heart when I analyze politics as politics is not my lover. I believe issues are better understood on a  case by case basis. My views are different depending on situation. Too bad if it's too much for your brain to process https://t.co/pSO5HElUTb Whatever be his personal issues with the PM, this letter is worth reading. BJP has a lot to introspect on. Economy or social issues, things have not gone as planned:  Dear friend, speak up \u2013 The Indian Express https://t.co/qc3sEedq6T Always had a problem with #betibachao slogan. Women r not just someone's betis. They r individual citizens with their own passports. And they have the right to feel safe in their country. Not because we want to bachao our betis. Because they r more than betis. They are citizens. Q: Where were you when (something similar and wrong) happened in the past?\nA: I was here only. We were all here, seeing all wrongs happen in India. But now we want something done about it. Why do wrong things in past justify that wrong things in the present should not be fixed? 8-year old cows have better luck than some 8-year old Indian girls. It shouldn't take a gruesome killing of an 8-year old for people to react. ANY fundamentalism, ANY means ANY, should be nipped in the bud. Else it only gets more evil and ends like this. If this death affected you, swear to yourself - Zero tolerance for fundamentalism. You reach a pinnacle in your career and become a minister or state minister MP or whatever. Then out of political compulsions, you can't even react to the rape and murder of an 8 year old in your country. What use is such power? What's the point of your life? There\u2019s a child\u2019s rape and murder. And then there\u2019s the government\u2019s reaction to the rape and murder. Both can be equally disturbing events. If you are taking political sides in rape cases, you are part of the problem. Today you are okay with the fringe threatening a movie and its cast, tomorrow the fringe is going to rape and kill little girls. I don\u2019t care about your political compulsions, the ideology of your party, your attachment to a religion and your political loyalties. If you don\u2019t crack down hard and do so publicly on those who hurt an 8-yr old girl, you don\u2019t deserve to be an Indian leader. @vineetjaintimes hi Vineet can we talk? DM me please. Steve Jobs was removed. The Uber founder was removed. But how hard the ICICI board is trying to save an employee CEO, when her husband and brother in law were doing business  with the banks biggest NPA. Only in India. And then they say why investors don\u2019t trust Indian cos. Stop kidding yourself ICICI board. Your CEO has to go. Fired. Not step aside interim nonsense. You guys have proven to be one of the dumbest, wimpish, crony boards in India. Spoiling ICICI\u2019s and India\u2019s name world wide. https://t.co/R09VqmdZvH No I didn\u2019t.

Noted. Chalo thanks. :) @aaliznat @PedestrianPoet @ShekharGupta Ok. Next time u call me angsty teenage boy I should just not tell u my pov. Right? Is this Feminism btw? @aaliznat @PedestrianPoet @ShekharGupta It was @ShekharGupta \u2018s publication who I admire a lot. Had to alert this writer had intentionally hid my research on the book. That\u2019s what I said first place. Staying silent when people lie about u isn\u2019t also the best thing to do. Am not foolish to display emotions on twitter. @aaliznat @PedestrianPoet @ShekharGupta I love running :). Am not upset so don\u2019t assume my emotions. Lying has no grace in my books. But to each their own. @vimo_67 @FuschiaScribe That\u2019s fine buddy happens all the time. But if someone just uses crap language without justifying why, it makes them a troll. And they r my cute lil trolls so I love them. Even tho their brains are tiny @aaliznat @PedestrianPoet @ShekharGupta Sweets she lied. Hiding behind gender or calling me names ain\u2019t going to change that. Defend her. She\u2019s ur ilk. And u r born to be a herd member. So stay that way. Now run along. U got ur attention too :) @The_Physicst @FuschiaScribe Nice. Multiple uses. Isn\u2019t it? I believe in recycling. Meanwhile u stay a troll. Born to be that :) @FuschiaScribe Aww. How sweet. I love my books actually. But u r a lil Troll. And that\u2019s what u gotta do. Hugs. @shukr_11 Please note this is a fake page. Blue tick missing. @adityampaul @PedestrianPoet Samajh hoti to samjhate. Plus u have to hate me as ur friends expect u to. Who r the ivory tower types u know better. Read again. Has she twisted how I said I researched? No? Lol @adityampaul @PedestrianPoet Read her article please. First para. Nothing is biting me. If you guys had more IQ and less bias and better ethics would have engaged. Tab tak, bye little trolls. :) @adityampaul @PedestrianPoet Am saying she lied about my research. That\u2019s all. Never said or implied anything else so if you react on something I never said u know what that makes u. Maybe another liar? Lol @RashmiNairPhD @Komal_Dubey @SANDIPANMITRA6 @PedestrianPoet Chal jhoothi! Jaa kisi aur ko troll kar..:) Govt should push the ICICI bank desi banker uncles country club board to investigate what happened. Protecting investors who buy Indian shares worldwide is more important than any media hyped individual. Just way too many red flags here. Despite so many red flags and husbands and brother in laws kind of typical Indian cronyism coming out, ICICI bank board (or cosy club) not doing proper investigations and giving clean chit. Tells investors globally don\u2019t buy Indian shares we will do whatever we want and screw you V good article. https://t.co/xtn64qvOZR @RashmiNairPhD @SANDIPANMITRA6 @PedestrianPoet Wow. U r calling me names. Still not reacting to what I said. I said she has either lied or is incompetent because she hid facts to make her case. U have shown who you are, an abuser with zero analytical skills so discussion over. Bye. @RashmiNairPhD @PedestrianPoet Am not losing anything. Pointing out her lies. She has simply lied to make her point. Stop assuming and react on my points I raised, instead of personal attacks. @2bottle_down @ShekharGupta @PedestrianPoet So many women have told me that. But try telling it to elitist liars passing of as journos these days. @PedestrianPoet @ShekharGupta Nobody explained. They discussed. Each presented their side. Again you are lying. Not to mention shifting your original charge. U r biased and unethical. And maybe a hater. Anyway. Made my point. Tc @ShekharGupta @PedestrianPoet I also interviewed a 100, yes a 100, women over the course of a year before I wrote that book. waxing was a lighter moment. By hiding that fact, that journo has either lied or shown her incompetence. Negates premise and hence the whole article. Does disservice to feminist cause. The big shareholders of ICICI have to take action on the scam. If they don't, minority shareholders like the retail guys who bought shares in the bank are the ones fooled. Why join an Indian bank, reach the top and do scams, when you could have legitimately joined a foreign bank who would have hired you for much more money? Are the wheeling dealings of desi crony capitalism simply more fun? The ICICI alleged scam should be properly investigated. It is not a PSB, so onus is more on ICICI shareholders. If they choose to be wimps in awe of their management because they are oh-so-cool then they deserve to lose their money. Has India been told the Jodhpur jail\u2019s entire menu yet? Because you know, what could be more important? Hi guys, catch me live here: https://t.co/sFln7lE6p8 Visiting @i30_jee at Bangalore today.

That\u2019s the point I admire what you do sir but please do tell when was the last time DD criticised any govt.

Something to think about. #fakenews I would rather have some #fakenews (which I can usually detect anyway) than every channel become a Doordarshan clone. #fakenews is a real problem. Even I have been a victim. But it is not an excuse to pass a gag order on the media. We already have so many media houses bowing to the govt, let\u2019s not compromise whatever free media we have left. The government already has an image of being a control freak. This #fakenews order was a bizzare move. India ain\u2019t Russia or China. We are mad, chaotic, foolish sometimes but free. Do not try to change that. You must have a political death wish if you try to gag the media and piss them off one year before elections. #fakenews Nicely made video.

Its just amusing. U r getting touchy. @Sadafsayeed I never questioned it. I appreciate their political sense. Foolish people expect idealism in politics. Don\u2019t troll on things I never even said. Good list. All kind of tie-ups happen in politics. Nothing emotional. It\u2019s business as usual. https://t.co/Y63E6RgjIc @utterlybutterly When I am only making this statement why u r attacking me for what I haven\u2019t said. Trolling me for what I didn\u2019t even say. New levels of idiocy. U r being emotional in ur hate. Not me. Only fools get emotional in politics (many found on twitter too.) SP-BSP, BJP-PDP, BJP-TDP, Cong-NCP all tell you one thing: it\u2019s a business. If you falling in love with or hating a leader/party joke is on you. @khannadhiraj78 ok periods...tc @khannadhiraj78 bypolls show what can happen if SP and BSP come together. and it can be replicated in UP. hard for you to understand looks like. like i said, you are rude. maybe just u, not your parents' fault :) @khannadhiraj78 see how many LS seats they contribute and if it moves the probability at all. and am sorry your parents didn't teach you how to talk, no wonder u r so rude. @ZMadon And nobody said it is unprecedented. Also read up on how not to comment without reading what the other person has said. @ZMadon Read enough to not be an elitist and show off my reading habits. Pick a book called dictionary. Look up humility and decency. You may like it. Here's how I think probability of BJP coming back  in 2019 has changed in recent months (totally opinion, nothing scientific). by-polls yest were v significant: \nPost UP Assembly elections: 90%\nPost Guj Assembly elections: 80%\nPost Raj by polls: 75%\nPost UP/Bihar by polls: 65% I think SP and BSP will realize that life is just so much better if they linked their Aadhar cards to each other. All of a sudden, rivals SP and BSP will look into each other\u2019s eyes and find love for each other like never before. :) So @yadavtejashwi , seen as a beginner and written off at one time, is turning into a formidable politician in Bihar. Young, good with words, focused - all helps. Election Victory = power = eventual arrogance = eventual defeat. The circle of life, in politics. BJP landslide victory in UP earlier was because other parties cut each others votes, not because people loved demonetisation. This time they didn\u2019t. It is arithmetic. Not ideology. A+B+C is always greater than A or B or C. #gorakhpur #phulpur The Indian voter ensures no political party ever thinks of itself as indispensable. That\u2019s the beauty of our democracy and that is what has saved our country. #Gorakhpur #phulpur. Aadhar linking deadline extended again. It\u2019s like the nice teacher who pretends to be strict but keeps extending the homework due date. @EcoManOne Considered by who? My readers decide or you do? Lol. Like I said check elitist. One of India\u2019s big problems. @EcoManOne Who deems it? You? Am sure you do. Do check out the definition of elitist too. @EcoManOne Tell me the difference. In words. Pls teach this to the self styled elitist guardians of literature in India. https://t.co/57Sxi0Asto UAE people! Will be at the @emirateslitfest tomo, 9 March 2018.

Going after Mallya actually easier than Nirav, who's going to argue what is my fault if the bank is stupid? Not sure if arresting Karti will send a strong message against corruption, or will it actually highlight Karti belonged to which political side vs which side were Mehul Choksi and Nirav Modi on that they were allowed to leave.

Third rate IT reporting systems in public sector banks + corrupt and clueless officials + politicians controlling public sector banks + greedy promoters = Nirav Modi scam PNB just reported that the Nirav Modi scam amount was actually 1,300cr more than 11.5k crore they reported Feb14. Just 1,300cr more you see. A bank that has no clue how much was stolen even after it is stolen! Is a bathtub more important than a broken banking sector people are stealing billions from?

The one shining spark - a rising stock market - is also under threat now. Not reducing corporate tax for big corporates was another avoidable move. The mentality that 'big business = bad guys = must keep them under us and in check' runs deep in the govt psyche.  Very hard to change that, and hence we can never get proper growth driven policy. Throwing in ad-hoc taxes every year spooks investors. The Long Term Capital Gain Tax was avoidable. Signals govt will lure you in markets first, then sting you. Not cool. Markets getting whacked. Global cues making it worse. Reintroducing Long Term Capital Gains Tax not the wisest move. Coupled with bad luck of global selloff, stock markets crashing since budget.

It is the system. Not one party or the other. #2GVerdict can be a major, massive  plus for Congress and can be an inflection point for their national recovery. IF they use it well. IF.

Many people who describe themselves as open minded, liberal and tolerant are ganging up like a mob and abusing the hell out of me today Coz a lot of people love to virtue signal on twitter, don\u2019t know diff between one day and a whole year or how pollution is caused. https://t.co/xhZnVOovHR Stand up for your festival and religion, and this is what you get tagged.

Regulate. Don\u2019t ban. Respect traditions. Can I just ask on cracker ban. Why only guts to do this for Hindu festivals? Banning goat sacrifice and Muharram bloodshed soon too? SC bans fireworks on Diwali? A full ban? What\u2019s Diwali for children without crackers? @pzfahad I disagree. Not in my opinion. And we don\u2019t have to match it. To me the loans is the way to go. Just a pov. Nothing to be snarky abt @pzfahad @Sudip_007_truth We need to work together for the country. Not attack and form biases. We can learn from each other if we want to. Or just be snarky. @pzfahad @Sudip_007_truth B) the loans are an issue however. Why did a PSU lend here to a loss making co. That\u2019s what will yield something. @pzfahad @Sudip_007_truth So a) the turnover tho an issue wont yield much.   Coz u can\u2019t prove wrong doing so easily. Just noise and then nothing. @pzfahad @Sudip_007_truth Are u asking properly? Or to troll. @pzfahad I just the loans is an issue. Where is the clean chit? Are u lying now as well. Good job @pzfahad See. Once a troll. Always a troll. Chalo. Just wanted to point out to read all tweets. But find something else to be snarky on. Good luck @pzfahad And if a co starts one year and wasn\u2019t there last year is it Infinite growth? Anyway. Issue there is loans. Not turnover percent. @pzfahad No point telling u. u have to show ur friends u are against me. Prob with social media. We never learn. Only wanna reaffirm biases. Sad @pzfahad @thewire_in That\u2019s the same side. Duh. But calling something 16000% growth with a insignificant base is sensational click bait. It\u2019s ok. Not for u :) @pzfahad No it doesn\u2019t. Two sides of the same story can exist. Just because it doesn\u2019t agree with or is beyond you, keep hiding in ur elitism. Tc @pzfahad Did u read all my tweets this is a part of? Thought so. Keep hating Click bait media is a reality today. It means a lot of sensational stories. Even from reputed places. . @thewire_in has never had one nice thing to say about me. I sometimes find them biased too. However. They do not deserve to be bullied. At worst, a powerful govt bullying media is threat to democracy. At best, it is a huge PR disaster on part of govt. Don\u2019t bully, counter. Bullying the media is anti democracy. No govt is worth a threat to our great democracy. The more a political party tries to bury a story, gets defensive or bullies media, the more opposition sniffs the opportunity and attacks.

A good tip for politicians in all this is whenever u have allegations thrown on you, deflect them by doing a demo. Fry eggs or something. Haha\n1. so they thought, ab kaun hack kare, is it?\n2. oh, what about Goa and NE? They didn't sweep those either.\n3. Why? Too slow and lazy? https://t.co/ZykJV8q49p Conspiracy theories apart, trends, analysis, exit polls, variance in results over time all show elections in India are by and large fair. If someone is smart enough to hack EVMs across a million locations secretly, can't they replace boxes with paper ballots? Phir? Was major EVM hacker BJP stupid to allow AAP to win 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi? Or they learnt to hack later? Why they didn't hack Punjab? So all EVMs can be hacked, so in each of 10 lakh booths in India a voter is arranged who punches in secret code,and nobody ever speaks out? That EVM tampering demo is like opening your own car with your own keys and saying every car in the country can be opened with this key.

You've been in similar business long enough to know how politics works.People /parties are self serving.Stopped expecting idealism long back https://t.co/kG4ad2PR1z They could.But they didn't. Coz they don't care.As no opposition and they are getting away with it.Bashing me for talking reality is uncool. https://t.co/JldySTQmNg Because Anirban BJP is a pol party at end of day not a holy saint.unless kept in check with strong opp, such stuff will happen. Hence. https://t.co/5zoJI42O2D So true.. https://t.co/Lr7FIZAr5X Par hamari koi nahi sunta Barkha, here is mine (one of half a dozen) on why RG must go: https://t.co/cXk8jNmBXy https://t.co/tuCuDb3jjT @BDUTT Ok. But many did Coz if there is no strong opposition any party in power goes a bit out of line, this is no exception. Raga out, country saved. https://t.co/rMFCqc39Pr Coz that's what BJP's core base wants. And well, BJP ko base pasand hai.. https://t.co/Lhv1d5lwfF I thought that's what the media was saying no? https://t.co/QZ2wq25f84 I have one color. Brown. And I make observations, I don't become that color. And u just took me seriously. What color r u btw? https://t.co/ANuPsIAvDm There are choices within BJP but we can demand them now coz they know nobody is going to go to Rahul anyway.. remove Rahul first hence.. https://t.co/RSfN9ZCnFx I have a problem when religion mixes with politics. Any religion, any party, anywhere. https://t.co/KaFho3msBg We are bigoted people. Deep down. We love it. Disturbing to see some thumping chests  #YogiAdityanath appointment is a sort of victory of Hindu pride. Not my style of Hinduism or India. As winner BJP can appoint anyone as CM, but if they appoint a polarising anti-Muslim CM party should stop claiming they are secular. With the pro-development people in the bag, it was time for the BJP to cater to its other base, the pro-hindutva types. #YogiAdityanath Would I like a govt focused on development only and not hindutva? Yes. Do I have a choice? No.Fix Rahul Gandhi. Then talk of #YogiAdityanath They have to hate u.. not just pity u https://t.co/c2iaave4dd RT @abdullah_omar: Which begs the question - does this apply to the central government? What about Rajasthan? Maharashtra? J&amp;K? Madhya Prad\u2026 To protect one person's career, an entire party is getting destroyed, a democracy is becoming opposition less. Sad. If you are in politics and the Indian media starts hating you, you have a really bright future. #modi #yogiadityanath Did this tweet in 2015. Well, looks like they did something. Rewarded him. Not sure if that's what i had in mind! https://t.co/MQ2r00UaTJ BJP political calculation of #YogiAdityanath as CM:\nPros: polarised vote helps us. Cons: media hates us more, Mahagathbandhan may rise. #YogiAdiyanath as CM. Because when Rahul Gandhi is your biggest competitor, you can do whatever you want! Maggi: Health bhi. Taste bhi. BJP: Development bhi. Hindutva bhi. #YogiAdityanath #YogiAdityanath as UP CM. Because when you make the naughtiest guy in class the class monitor, he behaves the best.
