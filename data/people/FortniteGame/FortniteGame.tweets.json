[THREAD] Press play, grab yer pardner and come on down!\n\nGrab the Butter Barn Hoedown Lobby Track featuring vocals by Matt Daniel. https://t.co/AxXBuwj8NW Deliciously dangerous battle-brunches coming right up! Take the battle to-go as Ant-Man savors the adventures awaiting him on the island with Captain America. Finally, there\u2019s a FLASH as Ant-Man fixes his suit and returns to normal size! Phew! The bees are so shocked they take off and head back to the woods from whence they came. Ant-Man gives you a grateful look as you both decide to-- You run as fast as you can, the bees coming close behind. Your lungs are burning, it\u2019s looking close, but hopefully it\u2019s buying Ant-Man the time he needs! Those bees are hot on your tail now, so you need to make sure this doesn\u2019t become an all-out sting-fest! The best strategy to buy you and Ant-Man more time is clearly-- Moving as fast as you can, you grab the bag and run out of the restaurant. But outrunning bees is no easy task, and they give chase! Inside the bag, Ant-Man is trying to fix his size-changer as quickly as he can, you just need to buy him time. That\u2019s gotta be Ant-Man trapped in that bag. How are we going to save him from those buzzing pests? The greasy smell of fries hits your nostrils as you enter Durr Burger. Looks deserted. You\u2019re about to leave when you hear the sound of a tiny voice shouting from the corner. Looks like it\u2019s coming from an old take-out bag\u2026 and it\u2019s being swarmed by BEES! Looking at video of Ant-Man\u2019s last transmission, he seemed to be inside a fast food restaurant, which is as good a clue as any. We should start our search at-- Ant-Man was supposed to get here hours ago. According to Captain America\u2019s last communication with him, the Storm was causing some interference with his suit. He\u2019s worried that Ant-Man is stuck ant-sized somewhere and unable to change back. Never stand still and never back down \u270a\n\nFor all of our EU players out there, we're partnering with Three/WINDTRE to bring you the Fortnite Trinity Challenge.
