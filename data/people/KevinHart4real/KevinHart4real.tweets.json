I\u2019m watching so many decisions be made to stop the looting &amp; rioting. National guard has been called in...curfews are being moved around. How about arresting the other officers that were involved in the death of George Floyd. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f How about Justice??? Powerful...More Governor\u2019s &amp; Mayors need to follow this lead. Take accountability &amp; be apart of the change. We need new laws....we all know that the system is flawed....Let\u2019s take action &amp; create the CHANGE. ENOUGH\u2026 https://t.co/T13AtVolI5 Enough is Enough....it\u2019s time for CHANGE!!!!

THATS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT... So please do not let the media make you forget the WHY....this stops when the world takes the proper steps in fixing the matter at hand. This stops when the media pushes the correct narrative. This has to stop....these senseless deaths HAVE TO STOP!!!! I see this narrative being changed and I want to make sure that we are all aware of the WHY....this is happening because of Hatred in our country....This is Racism....People are sick &amp; tired of being treated this way. We are tired of watching our own die this way.... Enough is Enough.... Be apart of the conversation of change....we want and need change. The system is flawed and needs to be corrected. The police need to be policed....we need laws in place that will give us the safety that we as people deserve. Stop ignoring the PROBLEM You can\u2019t ask for peace if your not willing to give JUSTICE....people want JUSTICE. It\u2019s that simple....Throw all of those cops in jail NOOOOOWWW. That\u2019s taking action....Point blank!!!! This is what we want to see.....JUSTICE. RT @marcogiunta: @KevinHart4real I wish more people listened to your audiobook #thedecision!

For example....I'm shooting a movie at the moment &amp; I wanted to meet with someone of importance. I asked them if they wanted to make this meeting a priority and they replied yes....so they flew to me and we met at 6:30am for 2hrs before I went to work.
