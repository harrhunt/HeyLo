We are tired of watching our own die this way.... Enough is Enough.... Be apart of the conversation of change....we want and need change. The system is flawed and needs to be corrected. The police need to be policed....we need laws in place that will give us the safety that we as people deserve.

Work hard so you can play harder!!!!!! #Message The point that I'm making is that neither one of us had the time but we found the time because we knew the value and the potential reward behind the meeting. For example....I'm shooting a movie at the moment &amp; I wanted to meet with someone of importance. I asked them if they wanted to make this meeting a priority and they replied yes....so they flew to me and we met at 6:30am for 2hrs before I went to work.
