Personally, I\u2019ve made the decision to give all of my employees June 19th off in honor of Freedom Day from now on, and to continue to educate myself on the history that brought us to this present moment. Happy Juneteenth! I want to thank @TheRoot and @RhapsoDani for allowing me to post this video about the significance of today, June 19th, and why it should be celebrated as a National holiday. https://t.co/7yjwh4Lddg YES!! Thank you to the Supreme Court Justices who voted in favor and all the advocates who have fought so hard for this! We still have a long way to go to reach equality, but this is a beautiful step forward. \ud83c\udf08\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9c\ud83c\udf08 https://t.co/zTd3i5P2TL When you fight to honor racists, you show black Tennesseans and all of their allies where you stand, and you continue this cycle of hurt. You can\u2019t change history, but you can change this. \ud83d\ude4f I\u2019m asking the Capitol Commission and the Tennessee Historical Commission to please consider the implications of how hurtful it would be to continue fighting for these monuments. We need to retroactively change the status of people who perpetuated hideous patterns of racism from \u2018heroes\u2019 to \u2018villains.\u2019 And villains don\u2019t deserve statues. Taking down statues isn\u2019t going to fix centuries of systemic oppression, violence and hatred that black people have had to endure but it might bring us one small step closer to making ALL Tennesseans and visitors to our state feel safe - not just the white ones. His statue is still standing and July 13th is \u2018Nathan Bedford Forrest Day.\u2019 Due to social pressure, the state is trying to overrule this, and Tennesseans might no longer have to stomach it. Fingers crossed. Then we get to this monstrosity. Nathan Bedford Forrest was a brutal slave trader and the first grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan who, during the Civil War, massacred dozens of black Union soldiers in Memphis. https://t.co/n2DiEt9F3P Replacing his statue is a waste of state funds and a waste of an opportunity to do the right thing. FYI, he was a white supremacist newspaper editor who published pro-lynching editorials and incited the arson of the office of Ida B. Wells (who actually deserves a hero\u2019s statue for her pioneering work in journalism and civil rights). Edward Carmack\u2019s statue was sitting in the state Capitol until it was torn down last week in the protests. The state of Tennessee has vowed to replace it. As a Tennessean, it makes me sick that there are monuments standing in our state that celebrate racist historical figures who did evil things. Edward Carmack and Nathan Bedford Forrest were DESPICABLE figures in our state history and should be treated as such. We need to fight for mail-in voting for the 2020 election. No one should have to choose between their health and having their voice heard. https://t.co/4ImsKW1fQN This article written by @BarackObama is a fascinating read about changing policy at the state and local levels. https://t.co/kwwFjaXCuC Racial injustice has been ingrained deeply into local and state governments, and changes MUST be made there.\u00a0In order for policies to change, we need to elect people who will fight against police brutality and racism of any kind. #BlackLivesMatter After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence? \u2018When the looting starts the shooting starts\u2019??? We will vote you out in November. @realdonaldtrump VERY STOKED about this cover of lwymmd on @KillingEve by Jack leopards &amp; the dolphin club!! https://t.co/fhkLfOssfm @etnow I personally really relate to this tweet. \ud83d\ude0e The City Of Lover concert is streaming on @Hulu + @DisneyPlus!
