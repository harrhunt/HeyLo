I firmly deny the accusations being issued against me. Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in. Keen as I may be to clear my name, I refuse to feed the media spectacle created by people seeking to promote themselves at my expense. Aguardarei com tranquilidade o resultado de quaisquer investiga\u00e7\u00f5es e processos, pois nada me pesa na consci\u00eancia. Nego terminantemente as acusa\u00e7\u00f5es de que sou alvo. Considero a viola\u00e7\u00e3o um crime abjecto, contr\u00e1rio a tudo aquilo que sou e em que acredito.
