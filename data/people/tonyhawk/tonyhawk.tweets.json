He introduced me to everyone else and treated me like I belonged (a rare experience for me up to that point). His energy was contagious, and I am thankful that @skatepark is associated with his legacy. This is dedicated to Regis, who helped start @skatepark (formerly known as THF) in 2001 by inviting me on WWTBAM.

Yes, I fractured that finger on a 1989 Bones Brigade Tour Just received my x-rays from Saturday\u2019s debacle.

Thanks to everyone that came to our Huckjam Stage at @WonderfrontFest yesterday. We\u2019ll be back today skating at 2:45pm (free to the public, with Downhill Jam) and at 7pm with @ztrip (after X plays &amp; just before Suicidal Tendencies). Come see us before we get institutionalized. https://t.co/FeeqASHdlM Last night was wild. I took a helicopter to L.A. for a shoot with @nyjah.  We skated through 2nd St tunnel a few times while police held traffic. Got back in the heli &amp; headed home. If these are the twilight years of my skate career, I\u2019ll be riding them until the wheels fall off. https://t.co/axKaUfqog2 @Samuel_James92 The usual: kids, taxes, car trouble, McTwists @Jarronxo @LaurenGores @AmexBusiness @Dell The next day A conversation with auto service: \nmy life as a meme https://t.co/0QbZfKQIvE It was great chatting with @LaurenGores, @AmexBusiness and @Dell earlier this week at #DF19 \u2601\ufe0f about how building an authentic brand that stays true to your passions is one of the most important aspects of building a successful business. #Ad #AmexBusiness #DellSmallBiz https://t.co/4r6jtm4uSV Had a blast at #DF19 with @amexbusiness and @dell discussing @Birdhouse and authentic brand experiences #Ad It was fun to share the story of my business journey and connect directly with fans at the same time. #AmexBusiness #DellSmallBiz https://t.co/wE3iPif5aG @ImaLogdog @WonderfrontFest We\u2019ll be skating at 2:45pm on Saturday &amp; Sunday... no tickets necessary for that performance. You\u2019re welcome I\u2019m sorry to anyone that unintentionally saw my elbow trauma. I thought it would be interesting to share a type of challenge that we encounter as pro skaters, and the humanity of my experiences. I\u2019m currently on  antibiotics and still on schedule to skate @WonderfrontFest Sat/Sun @mayanrelic like victory @Luke_Hinto Looks legit Watch what you wish for... \nmy apologies to the Westin in SF for defiling that one towel. #supersoaker \n#staphportal https://t.co/8qvpda4qbR @Team_Cline St Louis! Last weekend I cut my elbow badly (while skating, duh). I was too lazy to get stitches so I closed it myself using Steristrips. Yesterday it got infected so I was advised to drain it. It\u2019s gross, but kinda fascinating considering the success of @DrPimplePopper\nAnyone want to see? RT @SportyFrye: Friday I spoke with skateboard legend @tonyhawk, who had a lot to say about authenticity in business. \n\nQ&amp;A with Tony at @F\u2026 Congrats Devyn, you\u2019re going to @WonderfrontFest ! https://t.co/YgZ1cfFI7h The #wonderfrontfestival in San Diego is only one week away!

Sunday Funday! https://t.co/yOIubBZeTv @MillennialDrop @WonderfrontFest I\u2019m actually Generation X \n(like the band) Yesterday I was giving out passes to @WonderfrontFest while skating a park in San Diego. Fell on a lipslide, hit my head/helmet at a bad angle &amp; split my eyebrow open. \nI learned a valuable lesson that day: kids will ask for your autograph even if blood is dripping down your face Shout out to Noah Vester from Denmark For recreating my entire @berrics Battle Commander video shot for shot at #CPHskatepark:\nhttps://t.co/ikyiULk6eI Fakie chicken wing between 1-2 o\u2019clock from @LakaiLTD Brazil tour https://t.co/ixbsSD5Btq @kingskeef I did.

Quick question: Do you respect wood? I revere wood. https://t.co/kj4ZKh8xlW @artwilliamsgs This story is true down to every last detail. Not sure what it has to do with texting but I make no money from either one. Just thought it was funny. @gupimusic It\u2019s still upsetting, and now we have \u201cHODL\u201d to carry the torch Follow up: I asked him his name and he said Irving. I told him my name is Tony, to which he replied sarcastically \u201clike Tony Hawk haha\u201d\nand then he left. Kid at skatepark (as I arrive): \u201cyou a good skater?\nme: sometimes\nhim: you ever been here?\nme: no\nhim: you travel a lot?\nme: yes, perhaps too much \nhim: are you a YouTuber?\nme: no, I\u2019m just a skater and a dad\nhim: wanna see me do a jump?\nme: absolutely\n..and I then shot this pic https://t.co/IBODPauEe2 Looking forward to it! I\u2019ve been riding the Bitcoin transitions for over 5 years now. Which reminds me... should I bring my ramp? https://t.co/0rDyit2Th1 @nnoahfitzgerald It\u2019s me! I was thinking about this flip-board-transfer thing for years and finally tried it last week, even creating a comically shaped landing board. The hardest part was aiming, and then leaning forward at the end. It was a brutal battle but I\u2019ve already recovered thanks to @CannaHempX https://t.co/q1AmEnUjQN That time I was a \u201cMystery Diver\u201d on ABC\u2019s Splash. I\u2019m just thankful that \u201cDo A Kickflip\u201d wasn\u2019t a thing back then... it would have been the worst credit card ever. https://t.co/vPsQ17NWnb @halo57634 @The_Hermit_Crab @John97Jackson I too cringe when I see it. I let spellcheck undermine my grammar on that one because I was rushed trying to get the Tweet out before takeoff. Me talk good otherwise... Whose reading these anyway? \n(SWIDT) Translation: my son @rileyhawk666 was sponsored by the company she works for years ago, but he is no longer with them (they let him go because he rarely competes on TV... their loss). And apparently they never update their website. \nIn other words, she has no Hawks to speak of. Woman at restaurant: \u201cTony?\u201d\nme: yes\n\u201cI came over to say hi because we have you\u201d\nhuh?\n\u201cat _ _ _ _ _ _ _ (company name)\u201d\nI don\u2019t understand\n\u201cyou\u2019re on our team!\u201d\nthat\u2019s not me\n\u201cbut you\u2019re on our website\u201d\nyou mean my son Riley\n\u201cyeah that\u2019s it\u201d\nbut you let him go years ago\n\u201cwe did?\u201d @katiemaller It was me! This is a powerful message about bullying. When I was young I got \"picked on\" because I was skinny, nerdy and rode a skateboard (which was NOT cool then). Recognizing this as being bullied has been cathartic, but I am thankful that there are now effective ways to end the cycle. https://t.co/ZkE55RPhv3 @LameAsChris All is forgiven. Sick nosegrind shuv btw. Let me know what you think of my weird flip transfer thing if you saw it. @LameAsChris This is absolutely fake. I would never discourage someone from skating, nor do I care how someone holds their skateboard.
