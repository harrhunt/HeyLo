The irony about Yoho\u2019s excuse for his \u201cpassion\u201d in accosting me is that he says he has a personal history w/ poverty, and took offense that I discussed poverty and crime.\n\nSo... he accosted me... to prove poverty doesn\u2019t result in traumatized behavior?\n\nOK \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffd where\u2019s the apology https://t.co/BKzJa7KUBW - Does not apologize or name any action he did\n- Does not accept responsibility\n- Lies (this was not a \u201cconversation,\u201d it was verbal assault)\n- Distracts by making it abt poverty (ironically)\n- Says everyone else is wrong and the incident never happened.\n\nThis is not an apology.

That not how it works.\n\nPeople who study crime know that (despite how many pundits pretend otherwise), *causes of crime are complex* and there are few neat and tidy causal relationships. None of these policing reductions have even *happened yet.*\n\nSo a spike is happening WITH a $6 billion dollar NYPD budget.\n\nYou either know this &amp; are intentionally lying, or you\u2018re a bad spokeswoman &amp; haven\u2019t verified your claims.\n\nGiven your work with @NRA it\u2019s probably both. https://t.co/vHtq04ei86 It\u2019s our real life.\n\nWhile it takes months, sometimes years to study crime data, I personally can tell you that fed &amp; state relief is NOT reaching people.\n\nWe aren\u2019t getting stimulus checks (mixed status fams), millions can\u2019t pay rent, &amp; summer youth employment has been cut. /7 I take this issue seriously. Unlike many of GOP pundits theorizing from suburban homes, I\u2019ve had multiple family members shot, shot at, stabbed, etc.\n\nCrime + community violence isn\u2019t some thought experiment to project your thoughts &amp; theories abt communities you\u2019ve never met. /6 Mind you, there are entire TV series glamorizing, humanizing, and sympathizing White Americans in this exact situation of selling drugs to live - Weeds, Breaking Bad, etc.\n\nBut fact is, Black &amp; Brown communities have been in this predicament forever &amp; get called \u201canimals.\u201d /5 For Black &amp; Brown communities, especially in the era of criminalization, the choice to sell weed of course is a risky one - not just w/ police, but with those you get tied up with.\n\nYet when a teenage boy believes the other option is homelessness, they may take the chance. /4 It\u2019s virtually impossible to pay rent on $8/hr.\n\nAnd when you are teenage boy in a fatherless home (his dad passed away), there is a drive to be \u201cthe man of the house.\u201d To help your mom.\n\nAnd what makes money fast when a full time job doesn\u2019t pay enough to live? Selling weed. /3 Let me give you a real life example that I\u2019ve encountered often (wording vaguely to protect people).\n\nGrowing up I was friends w/ a boy who was the son of a single mom.

If you believe in:\n\nhealthcare as a right,\na living wage,\nthat working class &amp; marginalized people deserve power,\nthat climate action should be on the scale of the crisis,\nthat racial justice is key in all this &amp; more,\n\nThen we are on the same team.\nLet\u2019s accomplish it together. It is important to fight for the issues, advance your argument, and grow the cause.\n\nTo do so, the questions that organizers or anyone seeking to advance a cause or campaign should always ask themselves are: who else can we include, and how can we listen and include them? Effective organizers are welcomers, natural educators, and positive in their interactions.\n\nThey make new people feel like theirs is a movement they want to be part of.\n\nEffective organizers treat the internet as an organizing space (although not the *only* organizing space!).

What are you grateful for this year? \u2b07\ufe0f Look out for those in politics who like to label themselves \u201cfiscally responsible,\u201d yet only seem to care about the price of justice - not the cost of oppression.\n\nEverything has a price. And an unjust society is far costlier than one that invests in &amp; values all people. None of the politicians who brand themselves \u201cfiscally responsible\u201d ever raise concern about rushing to shower ICE &amp; CBP w/ $billions with 0 guardrails or oversight.\n\nNone of them ask about how we pay for corrupt contracts or mass incarceration.\n\nAsk yourself why that is. This is honestly one of the big reasons why the argument about \u201cpay-fors\u201d in healthcare, housing, etc so often are made in bad faith.\n\nI see decisions made every day that cost the American public billions of dollars a year for bogus reasons and nobody asks how we pay for it. /2 Earlier this year, Congress rushed to approve BILLIONS more $ for ICE + CBP.\n\nI saw members voting YES w/o even a summary of the bill. Nobody cared then how we\u2019d pay for it.\n\nNow ICE is setting up fake universities to trap students.\n\nYet we were called radical for opposing it.

And yes, those forces exist among all parties. Our political system\u2019s reliance on huge sums of money has many negative impacts, but one of the largest is that it takes lawmakers\u2019 time away from lawmaking.\n\nThat\u2019s a feature, not a flaw - the less time lawmakers have, the more special interests can slip in harmful provisions. Instead, your support allows me to spend hours each day studying issues &amp; exposing abuse of power.\n\nSo while Fox continues to laugh that I\u2019m \u201cjust a bartender,\u201d I\u2019ve spend the whole year studying big pharma, private equity, military contractors, and Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s shady deals. There is, of course, much more time for me to be fully present at my job. \n\nIn Congress, this is a luxury. Since I don\u2019t spend hours each day asking for money, I spend a lot more time legislating, studying, &amp; preparing/sitting in hearings.\n\nThis has cumulative effects over time. I intentionally built my campaign to rely on small-dollar grassroots support w/o any corporate $, because I felt that\u2019s the best way to be accountable to everyday people.\n\nIt has impacted how I work in Congress in powerful ways - ways I couldn\u2019t fully appreciate until I got here.

The cruelty is the goal.

It is hard to understate the enormity of the problem. We\u2019re talking systemic cruelty w/ a dehumanizing culture that treats them like animals. After I forced myself into a cell w/ women&amp;began speaking to them, one of them described their treatment at the hands of officers as \u201cpsychological warfare\u201d - waking them at odd hours for no reason, calling them wh*res, etc.\n\nTell me what about that is due to a \u201clack of funding?\u201d Now I\u2019ve seen the inside of these facilities.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the kids. It\u2019s everyone. People drinking out of toilets, officers laughing in front of members Congress.\n\nI brought it up to their superiors. They said \u201cofficers are under stress &amp; act out sometimes.\u201d No accountability. Just left the 1st CBP facility.\n\nI see why CBP officers were being so physically &amp;sexually threatening towards me.\n\nOfficers were keeping women in cells w/ no water &amp; had told them to drink out of the toilets.\n\nThis was them on their GOOD behavior in front of members of Congress. There are 20,000 TOTAL Customs &amp; Border Patrol agents in the US.\n\n9,500 - almost HALF that number - are in a racist &amp; sexually violent secret CBP Facebook group.\n\nThey\u2019re threatening violence on members of Congress.

Some of the most nuanced, intelligent, &amp; grounded people I\u2018ve ever met weren\u2019t at BU, MIT or Harvard events when I was a student.\n\nThey were the plumbers &amp; waitresses I hung out with at happy hour, who had ferocious intellectual curiosity *and* a lived context of the real world. Working people that GOP dismiss as \u201cjust a waitress/cook/etc\u201d contain multitudes, &amp; are just as capable &amp; intelligent as anyone.\n\nClassism - judging someone\u2019s character by their income - is disappointing to see from them.\n\nWhat is so appalling to GOP about having an honest job? As always, I\u2018m proud of my work in restaurants.\n\nI also worked for Sen. Ted Kennedy, piloted literacy projects in the South Bronx, studied Development Economics in W Africa, served as an Educational Director &amp; won international science competitions before I ran for office, too. Here\u2019s how: https://t.co/8Uv6mqm76f https://t.co/IFC8ddl79t Actually, that would make government better - not worse.\n\nImagine if more people in power spent years of their lives actually working for a living.\n\nWe\u2019d probably have healthcare and living wages by now. https://t.co/HoxIyu6ftj Since when are Obama-Trump voters \u201cordinary voters?\u201d \n\nThey are a tiny % of the electorate. (In fact, most voters didn\u2019t even vote for Trump.)\n\nSo on top of your troubling claims abt taxes, it\u2019s justified to see the word \u201cordinary\u201d here is a euphemism.\n\nThe question is: for what? https://t.co/FoL8oDFR8Z On climate, it\u2019s easy to follow \u2013 and there are detriments to following. You are too late. You do not control your destiny.

Remaining are life &amp; death implications of other statutes &amp; *how* laws are enforced.\n\nThat\u2019s a key part of policy in a wide range of issues from schooling to marijuana + yes, immigration too. Dred Scott was the landmark Supreme Court case that found the US Constitution didn\u2019t give citizenship to black people.\n\nThe 1st US immigration law was the Chinese Exclusion Act. It was a race-based policy that was upheld until 1942.\n\nThe \u201cNational Origins Formula\u201d lasted til \u201865. The history of Citizenship in the US is deeply woven with the history of racism. It has been used as the legal enforcer of racism for most of US history.\n\nCitizenship affords power, &amp; that\u2019s why citizenship of African Americans was long denied too - to both slaves &amp; descendants. The reason your abuela was \u201clegal\u201d was likely bc there was effectively no \u201cillegal\u201d US immigration when she came, except for the Chinese.\n\nThe US\u2019 first imm law was the Chinese Exclusion Act, &amp; explicit racism was allowed as legal grounds for US immigration laws until *1952.* https://t.co/rP316bIrd5 RT @GretaThunberg: Hope is contagious!\nI met with the inspiring Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, @AOC .\nHere is our discussion!\n#FridaysForFuture\u2026 \u201c\u2066I know so many people who feel hopeless, and they ask me, \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d And I say: \u201cAct.\u201d\n\nIt was such an honor to share this conversation with you, \u2066@GretaThunberg\u2069.\n\nThank you for being one of the leading voices on climate action today. https://t.co/ke1pzaO8pf Reminder that these camps are run **at a profit** and financed by private equity groups, many of whom lobby politicians to imprison more people.\n\nWall Street has made human rights abuse an incentivized, for-profit venture. https://t.co/9zABsm7WQ5 Pretty awful that the right would make a joke of visiting a child CBP camp - but fitting, given that they don\u2019t seem to care one shred about other people\u2019s lives.\n\nPS That watch belonged to my dad.
