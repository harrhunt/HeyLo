What gets left out in this convo is the massive racial wealth gap in the US.\n\nWhite high school dropouts are on avg wealthier than Black + Latino college grads. Education doesn\u2019t close that economic gap &amp; loans impact higher % of Black borrowers\nhttps://t.co/OMeiFBDnuq Average student loan debt in the US is ~$30k (LOTS have more)\n\nMany won\u2019t fully feel $10k in forgiveness until after a Biden presidency is over, when they\u2019ve spent 10 years paying off the other $20k+\n\nDems should be championing policy that people can feel ASAP. We need to go big. Very wealthy people already have a student loan forgiveness program. It\u2019s called their parents.\n\nThe idea that millionaires and billionaires are willingly letting their kids drown in federal student loans &amp; that\u2019s why we can\u2019t go big on forgiveness is about as silly as it sounds. RT @StrikeDebt: The legal authority to cancel student by executive authority is abundantly clear. https://t.co/4AaE0WF3Eb Republicans could trip over their own shoelaces and they\u2019d still find a way to blame me, immigrants, LGBTQ+ people, the Green New Deal, BLM, anything but accept responsibility for their own actions and dealings.\n\nIneptitude, bigotry, and corruption.

Stories are persuasive &amp;we can use your stories to convince others. You can be clear about your question: \u201cDoes Rep A support full student loan forgiveness?\u201d (You can insert any detail/number here)\n\nOr \u201cwhat\u2019s Rep B\u2019s stance on student loans? I can\u2019t seem to find it.\u201d\n\nOr \u201cI want to thank Rep C for supporting forgiveness. It means a lot to me.\u201d It can feel a little intimidating to call your rep\u2019s office the 1st time, but it\u2019s totally fine. The line literally exists for you (our constituents) to call us! \ud83d\udcde\n\nSome tips: Call YOUR rep! Say what neighborhood you\u2019re from if you\u2019d like &amp; be kind! Staffers don\u2019t deserve abuse. (Care much about a given issue, that is)\n\nAlternatively, if your rep sounds on the fence or hasn\u2019t defined their stance on an issue yet, calls from constituents really can make a difference in nudging them to come out on an issue. Puts it higher on the priority list. If you feel your rep is doing the right thing, calling to thank them shows their district notices &amp; appreciates their stance.\n\nKnowing constituents are watching &amp; care creates positive pressure to stay strong. When you don\u2019t think your constituents care much, it\u2019s easier to cave. The reason it\u2019s helpful to call YOUR rep even when they are doing the right thing is because reps are under a TON of pressure all the time. Sometimes it\u2019s political pressure to change a stance, but sometimes it\u2019s also time pressure vs other leg and you have to choose priorities. Today is a great day to call your representative and ask what their stance on student loan forgiveness is! \u263a\ufe0f\n\nAnd if you know &amp; appreciate your rep\u2019s stance on this or other issues, it\u2019s helpful to call and thank them.\n\nYou can find your rep\u2019s info here:\n\nhttps://t.co/t177CriorL RT @RepPressley: Yes, @POTUS does have the authority to #CancelStudentDebt with the stroke of a pen. \n\nHe can and must use it.

The borough of Queens has a higher population than the entire state of West Virginia. We should do what helps both instead of one.\n\nIf we cut relief checks to account for higher cost of living, BOTH Queens &amp; West Virginia get help. WV actually comes out ahead due to lower COL. Some who discount our proposals by saying \u201creps from urban &amp; suburban areas don\u2019t get other places\u201d don\u2019t seem to apply that consideration themselves.\n\nA $50k threshold is totally disconnected from the reality of tens of millions of people.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk Queens &amp; West Virginia: @hlg1964 Contact your member of Congress.

THAT is the risk we can\u2019t afford.\n\nIncome thresholds already work in reverse &amp; lag behind reality. Conservative Dems can ask to tax $ back later if they\u2019re so concerned. We cannot cut off relief at $50k. It is shockingly out of touch to assert that $50k is \u201ctoo wealthy\u201d to receive relief.\n\nMillions are on the brink of eviction.

After 4 years of fealty to Trump, it seems many GOP have turned into him. https://t.co/McADMwnmCE Senator Ted Cruz deliberately and knowingly amplified specific lies fueling violent attackers. In doing so, he contributed to the carnage of Jan 6th. His actions since show that if given similar political opportunity, he would choose to do it again.\n\nHe must resign.

My story isn\u2019t the only story, nor is it the central story of what happened on Jan 6th.\n\nIt is just one story of many of those whose lives were endangered at the Capitol by the lies, threats, and violence fanned by the cowardice of people who chose personal gain above democracy.

I\u2019m so sorry that this is happening to your family.\n\nWe need to hear an actual public explanation from the WH and McConnell about why they are blocking relief for adult dependents. It\u2019s deeply wrong. Last time $ went out, Treasury had to process all kinds of ppl &amp; sent cash in waves as they got info.\n\nThey still have the setup to send out that \ud83d\udcb0. So why not send out checks to whoever you can ASAP &amp; roll out to dependents, even if it\u2019s not on the same biz day, like last time? We were also told the reason adult dependents (ppl w/ disabilities, college students, etc) were left out from survival checks again is bc Trump wants checks ASAP &amp; said including adult dependents would \u201cslow it down,\u201d so he flat out refused - but that excuse doesn\u2019t make sense /1 Anyways, that\u2019s a very loose breakdown (at least process-wise) of how it went down.\n\nProcess is important because it\u2019s how pols get overwhelmingly corrupt and unpopular things into legislation. They can\u2019t campaign on it, so many use process &amp; obscure deals to sneak things in. The THIRD vote had the actual COVID relief: the too-little $600 checks, $300 in UI, SNAP\u2b06\ufe0f,etc.\n\nThere were also some omnis tacked on, but less controversial. (I initially voted PRESENT on this bc this process is so F\u2019d up, but then YES bc my families are so hungry. Wanted to \ud83e\udd22) The omnibus is actually a collection of legislation that funds each federal agency (Homeland Security $ + Enviro $ + NASA $, etc).\n\nThere are many agencies, so the 2nd vote was the omni w/ DHS, DoD, Fin Services &amp; a lot of the \u201cpork\u201d leg people are objecting to (I also voted NO) It\u2019s gross but also true!\n\nThe dilemma many were dealing w/ was: bc these things were tied together, it made clean COVID relief impossible. You can largely thank Mitch for that. I\u2019m not saying this is all 1 party but fr he\u2019s awful.\n\nAnyways the Omnibus has most of the gross stuff 2nd vote is the Omnibus.\n\nWhat\u2019s that? Basically the \u201cdeal\u201d is centered on tying COVID relief to funding the gov(aka Omnibus).\n\nThey were tied together so pols who were against COVID relief (checks, SNAP, UI, etc) could trade for their horse write-offs etc in the Omni. Gross, no? For context, it actually took 3 votes to pass this COVID bill. \n\n1st vote: The Rule (process vote)\n\nThe rule vote cleared the way for the bill to be brought to a vote so soon after text dropped.\n\nIt passed, which is one reason why the vote happened so fast. (I &amp; others voted NO) For people asking about the insane &amp; corrupt tax giveaways in the deal (ex. the \u201c3 martini lunch\u201d trash \ud83d\udeae) much of that gross stuff is actually the omnibus.\n\nIt\u2019s a little confusing, but basically there\u2019s 3 major components to the COVID deal:\n1. Rule\n2. Omnibus\n3. COVID relief Let\u2019s do it. @RashidaTlaib and I already co-wrote the COVID amendment for $2,000 checks, so it\u2019s ready to go.\n\nGlad to see the President is willing to support our legislation.\n\nWe can pass $2k checks this week if the Senate GOP agrees to stand down. https://t.co/GprwrUPali https://t.co/nFFs1ExqCK RT @RashidaTlaib: Me and @AOC have the amendment ready. Send the bill back, and we will put in the $2,000 we\u2019ve been fighting for that your\u2026 And by the way, it\u2019s not just members who need to see the bill ahead of time - YOU do. \n\nThe PUBLIC needs to see these bills w enough time to contact their rep to let them know how they feel.\n\nMembers are reeling right now bc they don\u2019t have time to consult w/ their communities. This is why Congress needs time to actually read this package before voting on it.\n\nMembers of Congress have not read this bill.

They deserve better. Congress is expected to vote on the second largest bill in US history *today* - $2.5 trillion - and as of about 1pm, members don\u2019t even have the legislative text of it yet.

You know why all this backlash happens when we say \u201cTax the Rich?\u201d\n\nBecause the unquestionable norm is to tax the poor &amp; working class.\n\nMaybe instead of taxing people who need baby formula and essential goods, we tax those who have profited billions from a global pandemic? https://t.co/daAXNMAQD0 We know that neither \u201cacknowledging science\u201d nor \u201cfood rationing under crony capitalism\u201d works in their understanding of reality so they\u2019re gonna go with \u201cfood staples sold out because of a tweet once\u201d No, I just googled how to make my own adobo.\n\nBut of course Fox would rather indulge their made up fantasies than acknowledge that in the Trump admin\u2019s catastrophic response to COVID, millions of people rushed to buy canned goods which then had to be rationed at grocery stores \ud83e\udd14 https://t.co/qLHVNn5iJK The GOP acts like they care, but behind closed doors, this is what they actually say about the working class.\n\nGood to know how little you truly think of food workers, @DanCrenshawTX.\n\nI wonder: did you have catering while bonding w/ wealthy donors over your disdain for the poor? https://t.co/qrZShdTbME (Frankly they\u2019ve exploded for far longer than that too) College costs have exploded over the last 10-20 years &amp; wages have not kept up.\n\nIt\u2019s a totally different landscape and the fact they\u2019re using anecdotal experience from 20+ years ago to reinforce their opinions instead of looking at current cost/wage data is disturbing.

Messaging absolutely matters - and the attacks are more decisive when there\u2019s no deep canvassing happening. Does your family\u2019s elected officials normally have year-round deep canvassers in their community? @billscher Katie Porter And btw I\u2019m happy to cede ground on things that aren\u2019t working in some areas! But finger pointing is not gonna help. There\u2019s real workable &amp; productive paths here if the party is open to us.\n\n(After all, I got here by beating a Dem who outspent me 10-1 who I knew had bad polling) You can\u2019t just tell the Black, Brown, &amp; youth organizers riding in to save us every election to be quiet or not have their reps champion them when they need us. Or wonder why they don\u2019t show up for midterms when they\u2019re scolded for existing. Esp when they\u2019re delivering victories. By the way if white communities are getting more comfortable w overt racism or \u201ccultural resentment\u201d (if that\u2019s what they\u2019re rebranding it now) it\u2019s only gonna get harder for POC turnout to save everyone.\n\nReal organizing &amp; strategy is needed that disarms bigotry, not avoids it. And on this hand-wringing about slight POC increases for GOP in some areas - this is also an area w answers.\n\nBut honestly when it comes to Latinos the party\u2019s just never seriously made an effort. Mexicans, Central Am, Caribbean, Chicanos - Cubans are not the only impt community How do you make it less effective? Invest in year-round deep canvassing. Data shows that this kind of work helps blunt the force of racial resentment at the polls.\n\nIf you\u2019re always running away from convos about race, then the only ppl owning it are GOP. You\u2019ll lose. So the whole \u201cprogressivism is bad\u201d argument just doesn\u2019t have any compelling evidence that I\u2019ve seen.\n\nWhen it comes to \u201cDefund\u201d &amp; \u201cSocialism\u201d attacks, people need to realize these are racial resentment attacks. You\u2019re not gonna make that go away. You can make it less effective. There are swing seat Dem incumbents who cosponsored the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, etc and if I\u2019m not mistaken every single one won re-election. Also, the decision to stop knocking doors is one people need to grapple with and analyze.\n\n@IlhanMN and @RashidaTlaib never stopped and may very well have helped delivered a Biden Presidency bc of it https://t.co/5nweAADmIF Ideology + messaging are the spicy convos a lot of people jump to but sometimes it\u2019s about execution and technical capacity.\n\nDigital execution was not good, polls were off, ironically DCCC banned the firms who are the best in the country at Facebook bc they work w progressives! Underinvestment across the board. Some campaigns spent $0 on digital the week before the election. Others who spent did so in very poor ways.\n\nIf I spent only $12k on TV the week before an election &amp; then blamed others after, you\u2019d ask questions. That\u2019s how it looks seeing this. There are folks running around on TV blaming progressivism for Dem underperformance.\n\nI was curious, so I decided to open the hood on struggling campaigns of candidates who are blaming progressives for their problems.\n\nAlmost all had awful execution on digital. DURING A PANDEMIC. What they have done - from @staceyabrams &amp; @fairfightaction to @ConMijente and the whole underrecognized legion of organizers- is nothing short of remarkable. Give them their flowers \ud83d\udc90 People need to really look at the communities who delivered these miraculous victories in AZ, GA, MI, MN, etc. They are rarely a focus of traditional political investment or electoral strategy,&amp; are often sacrificed in policy negotiations.\n\nOne \u201cthank you\u201d would be changing that.
