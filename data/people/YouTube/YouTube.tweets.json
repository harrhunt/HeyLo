The app is now available in over 80 countries and is used by over 35 million viewers every week. https://t.co/qZYf1mts2h https://t.co/Sx8FmXhq1j In addition to content settings, parents will be able to manage watch/search history, and bedtime &amp; break reminders will be on by default. Comments, live chat, channel creation, video upload and purchases will be disabled. We\u2019ll add new features and tools over time. The experience will come with limited features and three content settings to account for different parenting styles and individual differences in child development. https://t.co/IFMgLctd8D In the coming months, we\u2019ll launch this experience in beta for parents to allow their children to use YouTube via a supervised account. We\u2019ll start with an early beta for families to provide feedback for continued improvement. Today, we are announcing a new, supervised experience for parents who have decided their tweens and teens are ready to explore YouTube.
