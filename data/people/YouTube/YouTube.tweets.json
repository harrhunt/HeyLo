Who else will you be celebrating this Pride? \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 Lauren Morelli and Samira Wiley: According to @JessicaOOTC, @lomorelli and @samirawiley are \u201cthe cutest wives ever.\u201d Writing for Orange Is the New Black sparked Lauren\u2019s journey to self-acceptance and love with Samira. Ruth Ellis: Living to the age of 101, Ruth was known as the oldest lesbian ever. She came out in 1915 and was accepted by her family. She spent her life with Babe, who she met in the 1920s. Their Detroit home was known as \u201cThe Gay Spot,\u201d a refuge for queer teens. Sylvia Rivera: Another important figure in the Stonewall Riots, was lesbian icon Sylvia Rivera. LGBTQ+ activists at the time acknowledged her as a role model for young Puerto Rican transgender people. Storm\u00e9 DeLarverie: Known as the \u201cgay Rosa Parks,\u201d Storm\u00e9 was arrested the night of the Stonewall Rebellion. Marsha P. Johnson: Famous for her involvement at Stonewall, Marsha was a pioneer and queen. Fueled by her joie de vivre, Marsha\u2019s intersectional identity and activism inspired the first Pride parades. Magnus Hirschfeld: A German physician and sexologist who advocated for homosexual and transgender rights. Studying homosexual subcultures, he developed a system that identified a spectrum of sexuality that intersects with gender. Alicia Garza: As one of the co-creators of Black Lives Matter, @aliciagarza is on the frontlines fighting for all Black lives, including those of intersectional identities. Jonathan Van Ness: All hail @jvn whose style, humor, and gender-queer identity celebrates and empowers so many to embrace their true selves through radical self acceptance. Dolores del Rio: Known as Hollywood\u2019s Latina Lady Lover, this crossover actress\u2019 career spanned over 5 decades. She was a member of \u201cThe Sewing Circle,\" a group of Hollywood bisexuals and lesbians who met regularly for lunch and love connections. Sophia Jex Blake and Margaret Todd: This 1800s power couple were known as \u201cdoctor wives.\u201d Not only did the two break barriers in science and mathematics\u2014they were also in a long term relationship well before gay marriage was legal or accepted. From doctor wives to a gender-queer grooming expert, @JessicaOOTC breaks down 10 LGBTQ+ People You Should Know.

We celebrate how far America has come, and acknowledge how far we have yet to go. We remember that freedom is a struggle, and that no one is free until we are all free. https://t.co/owUKiU8E6X Juneteenth celebrations today include parades, cookouts, prayer gatherings, historical and cultural readings, and musical performances. Despite this, formerly enslaved Black women and men started gathering the very next year to celebrate Jubilee Day or \u201cJuneteenth\u201d across Texas. https://t.co/J9gxuLstSY News traveled slowly across Texas with some plantation owners deciding to wait until after the harvest to break the news to the enslaved. https://t.co/PzErqgKdac On June 19th, 1865, Union Army couriers in Galveston, TX, announced to the people of Texas that all slaves are free. The American Civil War ended in April of 1865, but it wouldn\u2019t be until several months later that enslaved people in the state of Texas would receive word of the Emancipation Proclamation and their freedom - they had spent two years \u201cdeclared\u201d free, but still living as slaves. https://t.co/W2TYOdFYn6 When President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1st, 1863, it declared freedom for over 3 million enslaved Black people living in Confederate states. But news of their freedom would take time - years - to spread. https://t.co/SXR8WrzjMk Juneteenth commemorates the end of slavery in America. It's a celebration of freedom, but its history is complex. https://t.co/QFyKN6KkJ4 @rhiannonthropp @BowtiesBooks \ud83e\udd17 In honor of #Juneteenth, @BowtiesBooks is bringing back their Queer Blackathon \ud83d\udcda.
