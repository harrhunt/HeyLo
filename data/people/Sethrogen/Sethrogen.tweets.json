Out of respect, I\u2019ll leave Idris out of all this. Some cats get high heels which is funny to picture in real life. Wide Awake!!!!! Ahaha Oh the cats of the railway train! Fucking finally! These cats love to mess up a made bed. Now they\u2019re on the railroad tracks they seem way too small!!! \u201cYeah I\u2019m a cat but I tap dance so I\u2019m gonna need to commission some tiny tap shoes.\u201d \u201cDo it more like a cat!\u201d - the director of cats.                                                \u201cYou sure it\u2019s not weird?\u201d - actor in Cats.                                                   \u201cNah fam it\u2019s fucking genius! People have loved this shit for decades! It\u2019s perfect!\u201d Ian Mckellan just straight up has normal fingers. Like why even make these actors show up on set? They\u2019re playing cats. How many times they say the word \u201ccat\u201d in a this? \u201cThe Theater Cat!\u201d Let\u2019s intro another fucking cat!!! Is magic cat a thing? Judi dench looks the most cuddly. Is the milk bar for humans??! For cats? Is this in Clockwork Orange world? Huh? A lot of neon lights at knee height in London in the 30\u2019s. Memory straight up comes from NOWHERE. Did they commission little chucks from the cat shoe maker? These cats are straight up wearing white chuck taylors!!! CG cat people dancing is odd. Is it impressive? I don\u2019t know! Their tales are dancing. WHAT IS JELLICLE?!,!? I have a hard time getting actors to rehearse for like 20 mins. They got these people to train to lick their hands and rub them in their hair for weeks!!! Judi Dench is in a cat fur coat which I can only assume is socially APPALLING in this world. Jason Derulos feet don\u2019t look like they\u2019re touching the ground. They move so funny. \u201cLet\u2019s make 35 nonsense songs introducing cats!\u201d - The makers of cats. Some cats in pants. Some no pants. This is so \u201cBroadway funny\u201d. These cats are like 2 feet tall in this world. That\u2019s a huge fucking cat. The mice!?!?!?!?!?!!? They made them go to cat school. Also the scale is bizarre. The behind the scenes features, which are amazing, said the set is 2.5 times scale but that would mean cats are like  60 pounds in real life! I\u2019m pretty stoned and watching Cats. I\u2019ve never seen the broadway show. It is truly trippy. Am I supposed to know what a Jellicle is? They\u2019ve said it 200,000 times but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening haha. @jaboukie I like gefilte fish with matzoh, which Jews call \u201cthe bread of affliction\u201d which is kind of hilarious. @henderstu @glennsumi Did you see the size of that chicken? @yashar Social distancing is hard for entertainers. @henderstu @glennsumi Young Guns? @pattonoswalt @jayleno I miss Jay Leno.

Holy Shit! https://t.co/RF28PvMwvm @jablonsky_steve @YouTube I remember this!!! @ryandowney @JuddApatow I think it was James\u2019 @RickGlassman @realDonaldTrump This is so amazingly funny. This image is not actually from #PineappleExpress, but is from a skit we shot for the Oscars that year, which was filmed by Spielberg\u2019s DP, Janusz Kaminski. https://t.co/GSDH7QTGix Kanye came to the premiere of #PineappleExpress. https://t.co/VpOMXHoiJI In #PineappleExpress, Saul calls his shit weed \u201cSnicklefritz\u201d because it\u2019s what our practical FX supervisor would call his second in command when he didn\u2019t like what he was doing and we thought it was hilarious. Of all the weird references in #PineappleExpress, my favorite is to the fact that Matheson is wearing \u201cBritish Knights\u201d, because when I was a kid I wore the fuck out of my BK\u2019s. The song Paper Planes by MIA does not actually appear in the movie #PineappleExpress, just the trailer. We DID have a smoking billboard for #PineappleExpress that got shut down by the fire department because people keep thinking it was on fire. https://t.co/UslrDgNyuN Huey Lewis and the News recorded an original theme song for #PineappleExpress. We were inspired by our favorite 80s movies that had rock songs with their titles. Here he is performing it on Kimmel: https://t.co/nXVbuiW9z0 via @YouTube In #PineappleExpress, originally, Red killed Matheson with a Ford Fiesta, but Ford didn\u2019t want their car involved in a movie murder so we had to change it to a Daewoo Lanos, which is ultimately much funnier I think. RT @eliistender10: I made #Lego #PineappleExpress @LEGO_Group @Sethrogen https://t.co/abNHe0F2rg @Pattiwithaneye Haha. That\u2019s true. I did my 99% of my own stunts in #PineappleExpress, (which might explain all the injuries) including this one: https://t.co/DrV9jF1wIS While we were filming the scene where Red is taped to the chair in #PineappleExpress, Danny had to actually be taped in the chair all day and we couldn\u2019t let him out because it took too long to put him back. https://t.co/vBmmcRTuiL @RoyalCaribbean @younghollywood All in good fun. In #PineappleExpress, Red was originally supposed to die the first time he was shot when he was tied up in his apartment, but we thought Danny Mcbride was so funny that we just kept bringing him back to life. The shots of the dick drawings on the principals desk in Superbad was actually filmed on the set of #PineappleExpress in the woods while we were shooting Dale and Saul destroying their cell phones. We wrote #PineappleExpress express for me to play Saul and Franco to play Dale. James wanted to switch roles, and I didn\u2019t care that much, so we did. In #PineappleExpress, Red refers to his ex wife having gotten out of jail recently. There\u2019s a pic of Red and his ex wife, who was played by Stormy Daniels. The reason Saul wears a headband in #PineappleExpress is the result of another injury. There\u2019s a shot (that\u2019s in the movie) when we are running through the woods, Franco hits his head on a tree. He actually hit his head on a screw that was holding a pad in place and got stitches. Throughout the fight scene in Red\u2019s house in #PineappleExpress, I broke my finger and Danny McBride got his head cracked open when Franco hit him with the bong. There was NO strain of weed called #PineappleExpress when we made the movie. We said \u201cif one day, people are out there selling weed called Pineapple Express, it worked\u201d. The name #PineappleExpress was around for years before the movie. It\u2019s a Hawaiian weather system that sometimes hits the Pacific Northwest, which is where we\u2019re from. Evan heard the name and said \u201cthat would be a great name for a movie.\u201d  Years later we found a perfect fit. In #PineappleExpress, me and my co-writer Evan had to roll all the cross joints needed to film (about 100) ourselves because nobody else on the crew could roll them properly. #PineappleExpress came out ten years ago today.  Here\u2019s some fun facts about the movie! https://t.co/8dMjT2YKyE New #Preacher tonight on AMC. This show is wonderful and crazy. Please watch if you like those things.

How would it go in an ideal world? @Pariah1974 @RMTheLastJedi Yo I\u2019m just trying to wrap my head around the strategy. @TwiztidMetal31 @RMTheLastJedi They why didn\u2019t they pay off the critics more for Solo? @TheAOIJ @RMTheLastJedi I could be wrong, but I don\u2019t think you understand the intricacies of the legality concerning intellectual properties. @TwiztidMetal31 @RMTheLastJedi So, roughly, would you say it\u2019s done pretty much the amount of times you don\u2019t agree with the critical consensus? @yttttttt46 @TheAOIJ @RMTheLastJedi Yeah. But you can\u2019t get 200 million without those things. You need those things to get money, from my understanding of the process. @TheAOIJ @RMTheLastJedi But they can\u2019t call it Star was the last Jedi. @TwiztidMetal31 @RMTheLastJedi Why don\u2019t all studios do it? This makes no sense at all. According to this logic there would be no expensive movies with bad reviews. @BubbaBumpass @GarethKowalski @RMTheLastJedi And DC just didn\u2019t think of trying that? Or just once with WW but then they bailed on the strategy for JL? This is a funny theory. @GarethKowalski @RMTheLastJedi Hahah. That\u2019s hilarious. @aragonxxc @RMTheLastJedi It is? @TheAOIJ @RMTheLastJedi What\u2019s the point? @RMTheLastJedi Pandering to whom? I\u2019m confused by why you think critics would pretend to like a movie? Why would that benefit them? @TheAOIJ @RMTheLastJedi I have. @MMaestracci @coraliefargeat Tu es Seth Rogen. @NyashaJunior @BuzzFeedNews You\u2019re telling me. @realAmer_Indian @RMTheLastJedi Yo please explain! I honestly want to understand this strategy. Maybe I\u2019ll try something like this if it\u2019s a good one! @RMTheLastJedi I reread your other tweet. So from what I gather you don\u2019t have investors, so Disney would just be entrusting you with the IP in the hopes you do it justice and are able  to pay for it. Is that the plan? I\u2019m so curious how this is supposed to work. @adamctierney @RMTheLastJedi Yeah that\u2019s a good point. Any plans for this remake guy? @RMTheLastJedi So do you already have investors? Like, you already got people to invest money with the HOPES that Disney will let you make this, which there is no reason or historical precedent for? @RobJustJokin I\u2019m in all those movies. @RMTheLastJedi How did you get investors without a script or stars or director or legal ability to make this movie? Those have been important elements in the past. @RMTheLastJedi Ok. Is someone actually investing money in this? @RMTheLastJedi Yo I\u2019m very confused as to what your goal is here. You literally want to spend 200 million dollars remaking the last Jedi? And someone is giving you that money? I don\u2019t get it. @AndyRichter This tweet isn\u2019t getting the credit it deserves.

It's about how you spend. And the movie (or person) itself is often (not always) the key factor. @kthalps @ggreenwald I just think that sometimes the \"if you're gonna be mad at THAT, then it's hypocritical to not be mad at THIS\" is sometimes not productive. @ggreenwald @dannyboi965 And again, I'm not looking to win this discussion.

I'm just confused how you can argue it didn't effect anything. There's no evidence proving it didn't. @ggreenwald So you think that evidence shows that propaganda is not effective? And it doesn't change people's views? @ggreenwald I'm not arguing that. I'm just curious if you think that propaganda just doesn't work?

Here's a scene from our new show Future Man, coming to Hulu Nov. 14th! https://t.co/Q7JfEGq21Q Future Man is being screened for the first time EVER in the UK at MCM London ComicCon tomorrow at 2pm, Gold Stage! Please enjoy #FutureManUK @ikebarinholtz @historylvrsclub This is my best tweet. @ikebarinholtz @historylvrsclub He's Just Not That Into Jews @RealSteveCox @Megbweb Dude... UN-FUCKING-TAG!!! @ikebarinholtz @historylvrsclub I think it's Home Fries. @jakewoolf Maybe. I don't know. @jakewoolf @MargaretMenefee @karaswisher Me and Glenn agree a lot on some stuff and less on other stuff. @jakewoolf I didn't gleam they were told to stop taking this money. I gleamed that they chose to in light of info the gov gave them. I could be wrong. @jakewoolf There are TONS of restrictions on our ad buys. The content dictates it. Some theaters won't put up our posters. Some channels won't play ads @jakewoolf They're not banned though. They just aren't taking their ad money.  They're still on Twitter. @jakewoolf What do you fear it will lead to? @NYDoorman @jakewoolf @TrevinoJake I'm confused. @NYDoorman @jakewoolf @TrevinoJake That the platform itself decides. And in this case they did. So everything is cool. Right? @jakewoolf @TrevinoJake I don't get how you think it should be. Twitter just has to ad take money from whoever wants to give it to them with no consideration? @jakewoolf @TrevinoJake Do you not think companies should not get to choose who's advertising dollars they take? @jakewoolf @TrevinoJake And I'm just using them as an analogy for any ideology that one might find distasteful. @jakewoolf @TrevinoJake It's not weird at all to choose who you want and don't want to help support financially. It's twitter's right and i agree with them. @jakewoolf @TrevinoJake There are Neo Nazis in other countries. Like Germany. @jakewoolf @TrevinoJake Not really. It means not supporting companies you feel don't align with your ideals. That's bad? @jakewoolf @TrevinoJake If Neo Nazis wanted to advertise in GQ, should they let them? Or be like \"nah we don't want your money or to spread this message.\" @jakewoolf @TrevinoJake I'm totally open to other views though. I just thought using your wallet to express your views was good. @jakewoolf @TrevinoJake It's okay to not accept money from people who's message you think is bad. If you're a private company. @jakewoolf @TrevinoJake I'm saying that choosing who you take money from is okay if you want. If you don't agree with people you shouldn't support them. @chrislhayes But choosing your advertisers is totally common. Like you don't see a lot of ABC ads on NBC. Right? @jakewoolf @TrevinoJake *our movies. @jakewoolf @TrevinoJake And TONS of countries choose not to show out movies. China hasn't released one in years and years. @jakewoolf @TrevinoJake I think it's responsible for them to realize they were taking money to spread propaganda from another government. @jakewoolf I'm just saying they didn't ban them. Lots of people choose who they don't want to advertise with them. The Easter egg in my mother's popcorn photo is my wonderful late Grandfather's bronzed dentures on the counter. (For real) https://t.co/F28fXMdyaU @jakewoolf They're still there man. https://t.co/zZaqb6HHgJ @jakewoolf That they won't spread Russian state sponsored lies for money? They didn't ban them. They just aren't taking paid ads from them. @PattiSolisDoyle That's not that hard. @keithcalder @Mickle_Jim Haha. I'm in production too and I AM tweeting about the director. @keithcalder @Mickle_Jim I've done that too but it ain't my money so I'm generally pretty cool. To me production is a wonderful time when it all seems great. @keithcalder @whilst_tweet @Mickle_Jim Animation is fun too @Mickle_Jim @keithcalder In production we just go nuts and do whatever we want while other people freak out. it's wonderful. @keithcalder @Mickle_Jim That makes sense I guess. @kim @keithcalder @Mickle_Jim I sleep pretty well during production. @keithcalder @Mickle_Jim Why do y'all hate production?

Anyway, if you dig Superbad, thanks for digging it. I wrote it with my best friend in high school and we still write together. It's lovely. The cast of Jersey Shore confirmed to me that the phrase \"D.T.F\" or \"Down To Fuck\" is from Superbad. My mother came up with the joke that Mclovin gets arrested for statutory rape at the end of Superbad. The end house party in Superbad was filmed about half a block from the OJ murder house. During the MPAA screenings of Superbad they said we were the first movie to say \"fingerfuck\" My good friend @mrDaveKrumholtz came up with the title Superbad while we were smoking weed at the oakwood Just like in Superbad, Mike Snider actually was the first guy to get a fake ID and it was awesome. The period blood on the leg scene in Superbad actually happened to my friend at a high school dance and we discovered it after the dance. Almost all the names in Superbad are people we went to high school with and lots of the stuff in the movie really happened to us. Evan Goldberg's brother Dave drew all the dick drawings in Superbad. Danny Mcbride is an extra in the background of the first party scene in Superbad. Some Superbad trivia for its ten year anniversary. I don't assume anyone cares that much but why not: @Bernadette_Knox No @MrJoshCharles Shot in LA @JAS_sword Bill sang it as an improv so we put it in @Ulis3ssss Kids don't get bad hangovers @gavin_conlon Yeah @Morefield23 Bang bus @TheFakeKerry Most liked it I think @MrJoshCharles Self drive. @dzBrindisi I think  it's Clark county which we made up @jholtgolfer1 Yeah @MrJoshCharles Double @askdadblog Nah man.
