You\u2019ll only know for sure when you listen to hybrid.

But that doesn\u2019t make hats an intoxicant. Just because in some situations something can impair some people, it\u2019s not an intoxicant. @waltshaub @Swisher3333 @KacieJacie @jaketapper You\u2019re definition of cannabis as \u201cintoxicating\u201d is based off racist lies and stigmas. @waltshaub @Swisher3333 @KacieJacie @jaketapper You\u2019re also stigmatizing those who smoke it all day. @waltshaub @Swisher3333 @KacieJacie @jaketapper People could be impaired by their sunglasses. Should nobody who works in government get to wear them? @waltshaub @Swisher3333 @KacieJacie @jaketapper You don\u2019t understand weed. @waltshaub @Swisher3333 @KacieJacie @jaketapper If you wore my glasses and tried to drive you\u2019d also crash. Should my glasses be illegal? @waltshaub @Swisher3333 @KacieJacie @jaketapper This, again, is based on the misconceptions about weed that were created by racists who made it illegal in the first place. @waltshaub @Swisher3333 @KacieJacie @jaketapper They\u2019re not the same and the false equivalency between alcohol and weed is also based on racist stigmas. @waltshaub @Swisher3333 @KacieJacie @jaketapper The idea that people smoke weed all day every day have a \u201cproblem\u201d is based on the lies of the racists who made weed illegal in America in the first place. @Hammerwerferin @jaketapper @waltshaub @Swisher3333 @KacieJacie They been a scanned and they\u2019re 100% healthy. @waltshaub @Swisher3333 @KacieJacie @jaketapper Your views on weed are based on the lies of racists. @waltshaub @Swisher3333 @KacieJacie @jaketapper That\u2019s not at all true. Weed is both a medicinal and recreational substance.

I\u2019m not sure if you know how state compliance works but it\u2019s actually very expensive to put weed through the legal system. Testing in state facilities, compliant packaging, etc. Also, we only use the tips of the plants, only use biggest buds, and only have fresh weed. @michaeloburns https://t.co/vFjJB9jNrH @michaeloburns \ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udca8 @josiahsolis Around then haha @2CentsTanner Please do. @gandalf590z Sorry this happened!! @MadridistaSal33 Soon! @kzea_shan https://t.co/vEHmZcf0qk @patisagod Haha you guys are fucking SET. @brokeneyeballs @EmilySativaa Working on expanding our delivery area!

Please clarify your views! @Hagstrom_Anders @johnrobertgage @SenMikeLee I don\u2019t think you hate Jews any more than someone hates the ladder they use to climb upwards. From what you say, you view us as a tool for your ascension. @Hagstrom_Anders @johnrobertgage @SenMikeLee I\u2019m curious how Jews help you get salvation? I know you view it as a blessing but maybe I wouldn\u2019t it you explained it better? @Hagstrom_Anders @johnrobertgage @SenMikeLee So you see me as a tool for you to get salvation? @jackbutler4815 @johnrobertgage @SenMikeLee That\u2019s a wildly vague answer.

How does that belief manifest itself? @johnrobertgage @SenMikeLee Cool. Go on... answer the question. @johnrobertgage @SenMikeLee You said Jews need salvation and redemption. Specifically. You singled us out. Said we were chosen for it. Why? What did Jews do? @johnrobertgage @SenMikeLee What do you personally believe Jews need to be redeemed from? What did we do? @johnrobertgage @SenMikeLee I have. But I\u2019m curious what YOU believe. When you say Jews have been chosen for salvation, what exactly do you mean by that? @johnrobertgage @SenMikeLee And by that you mean... @johnrobertgage @SenMikeLee Chosen for what? @johnrobertgage @SenMikeLee Good answer! @heroinsmoker @SenMikeLee I think that ship has sailed. @johnrobertgage @SenMikeLee Let\u2019s talk about that?

If you all enjoy commentary on terrible movies (and it seems you do), I recommend you spend some self isolation time listening to hands down my favorite podcast, HOW DID THIS GET MADE? in which truly hilarious comedians dissect truly awful movies. Enjoy. Release the Butthole Cut of Cats!! https://t.co/C2VgPqSv1L @thecherness It\u2019s on. Alright I\u2019m turning this off and watching 90 day fianc\u00e9. Good night. Stay clean as fuck. Out of respect, I\u2019ll leave Idris out of all this. Some cats get high heels which is funny to picture in real life. Wide Awake!!!!! Ahaha Oh the cats of the railway train! Fucking finally! These cats love to mess up a made bed. Now they\u2019re on the railroad tracks they seem way too small!!! \u201cYeah I\u2019m a cat but I tap dance so I\u2019m gonna need to commission some tiny tap shoes.\u201d \u201cDo it more like a cat!\u201d - the director of cats.                                                \u201cYou sure it\u2019s not weird?\u201d - actor in Cats.                                                   \u201cNah fam it\u2019s fucking genius! People have loved this shit for decades! It\u2019s perfect!\u201d Ian Mckellan just straight up has normal fingers. Like why even make these actors show up on set? They\u2019re playing cats. How many times they say the word \u201ccat\u201d in a this? \u201cThe Theater Cat!\u201d Let\u2019s intro another fucking cat!!! Is magic cat a thing? Judi dench looks the most cuddly. Is the milk bar for humans??! For cats? Is this in Clockwork Orange world? Huh? A lot of neon lights at knee height in London in the 30\u2019s. Memory straight up comes from NOWHERE. Did they commission little chucks from the cat shoe maker? These cats are straight up wearing white chuck taylors!!! CG cat people dancing is odd. Is it impressive? I don\u2019t know! Their tales are dancing. WHAT IS JELLICLE?!,!? I have a hard time getting actors to rehearse for like 20 mins. They got these people to train to lick their hands and rub them in their hair for weeks!!! Judi Dench is in a cat fur coat which I can only assume is socially APPALLING in this world. Jason Derulos feet don\u2019t look like they\u2019re touching the ground. They move so funny. \u201cLet\u2019s make 35 nonsense songs introducing cats!\u201d - The makers of cats. Some cats in pants. Some no pants. This is so \u201cBroadway funny\u201d. These cats are like 2 feet tall in this world. That\u2019s a huge fucking cat. The mice!?!?!?!?!?!!? They made them go to cat school. Also the scale is bizarre. The behind the scenes features, which are amazing, said the set is 2.5 times scale but that would mean cats are like  60 pounds in real life! I\u2019m pretty stoned and watching Cats. I\u2019ve never seen the broadway show. It is truly trippy. Am I supposed to know what a Jellicle is? They\u2019ve said it 200,000 times but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening haha. @jaboukie I like gefilte fish with matzoh, which Jews call \u201cthe bread of affliction\u201d which is kind of hilarious. @henderstu @glennsumi Did you see the size of that chicken? @yashar Social distancing is hard for entertainers. @henderstu @glennsumi Young Guns? @pattonoswalt @jayleno I miss Jay Leno. I never felt more like I was on a \u201ctalk show\u201d than when I was helping some zoologist hold a giant snake on stage. @henderstu @glennsumi Tombstone @bexthx No I wish. Listen to the Wu!!! https://t.co/EYf96Vtloo Instead of shaking hands, I\u2019m just doing the Wu-Tang symbol from now on. @maxsilvestri Fantastic. @shannonandswift @JensenKarp It was on the wall of the Red Robin I\u2019d eat at as a kid. @DescilloKing Enjoy!! @barton_0707 Thanks!! @cryptatoe Enjoy @lyvanup @RaxMothman I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a Jewish thing so much as your boss is an asshole? And you are a bigot? I think those are the ingredients at play here. @lyvanup Wildly anti-Semitic take! I\u2019m literally proof this isn\u2019t true. @melanierucinski Sometimes I\u2019m all ya got. Hi! If you own or manage a business and you have the ability to let your employees work from home, tell them they should. Don\u2019t give them the option because then it turns in to some sort of test. Just dooooo iiiiit.

And the more aware I am of bad blocking and staging. The Spahn Ranch scene in OUATIH is a good example of brilliant staging. Thanks for your time. This deserves more views and is probably better than at least 2 of the actual Star Wars movies. https://t.co/xNyY9nVOt8 The breaking of the fourth wall on Siesta Key this season is truly one of the greatest twists ever in reality TV. #Ish Black Monday season 2 is coming in March.

(I think it came out while I was on a hiatus) Here\u2019s a lovely article about my ceramics.  https://t.co/d8dCqxAjAs @nealbrennan It\u2019s a great movie because it\u2019s an important movie: it was clearly made by people who loved weed, and it was genuinely funny. It\u2019s the first \u201cweed\u201d movie I saw that was both these things. It made people like me think that weed based things were a worthy creative pursuit. We told the actors with small parts they could use their porn names as their character names in the credits of Superbad. https://t.co/GIORN8DO15 @97Vercetti That\u2019d be sexy as fuck. @dianaeranae Huh?!??

I don\u2019t remember much but we all definitely wrote the joke where they don\u2019t know the words to the song, and where Martin shoots the machine gun in the car by accident. And probably many more... @EricVespe I helped rewrite bad boys 2 @mrmarkmillar Oh you KNOW the Kingsman is uncircumcised.

It\u2019s a manic, tense, psychedelic, hilarious, insanely well executed film. As soon as it ended the audience burst in to applause. It felt like we all got off a ride together. @frynaomifry I\u2019ll never go past svelte. @AaronSmarter I smoked with the dude. His name was Jeff and we was dope. @Yassir_Lester Shhhh As you can see, the Pineapple Express hits the Pacific Northwest, which is where I\u2019m from, which is why the movie is called that.
