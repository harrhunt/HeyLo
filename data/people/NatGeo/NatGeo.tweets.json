If we care enough we will sacrifice a little comfort on our part as opportunity cost for their survival. Most rewarding is the opportunity to work with people and wildlife. Confronting, I would say balancing work with family time. \nhttps://t.co/YWXBfCt6In Food wrappers now top the list of most common beach trash\u2014surpassing cigarette butts for the first time https://t.co/aMoCLladOS to turn these agents of destruction into wildlife sculptures for sale. We enable better livelihoods alternatives via sales of these crafts to generate income and save wildlife by collecting snares from the landscape. So snares, the kind made out of wire from radial tires, are holding the population of lions in #MFNP at an artificial asymptote. We're working with several partners through @snarestowares to enable people living near parks We estimated the density of snares because lions are bycatch in these traps and their population in this park had stagnated for the last two decades despite abundant and increasing prey populations. We recently learned that Murchison Falls National Park has got the highest density of snares in sub saharan Africa \ud83d\ude25 (https://t.co/idmUfHoqUr)\n\nhttps://t.co/z0IusSosuU Jaguars prefer to ambush prey alone while the lions' favorite hunting style is group ambush. Also, no hard lines. Panthera pardus are found in the savannahs but hunt solo just like the jaguar of moist forests of south America. Some have said that hunting in a pack versus hunting as an individual is better explained as a matter of risk (including energy investment) versus reward, and less about 'environmental conditions'. \nhttps://t.co/WnisAqYScB When I joined wildlife club at my secondary school and reconnected with my rural past, I knew I wanted to be a conservationist. I attribute my career choice to my upbringing. I was raised by parents who loved nature. Additionally, I have had excellent mentors right from #MakerereUniversity where I had my first degree. \nhttps://t.co/DVMZoylbvs Farmers who lose livestock are often rightly bitter about lions while my friends in big towns away from harm's way take lions as beneficial. Depending on where you are in Uganda and who you ask, people have varied attitudes and perceptions. I have talked to school kids living near parks with lions who consider them as 'Mufasa' from the Lion King. \nhttps://t.co/WxITXzOQGd There is no guarantee. Follow all safety guidelines to avoid harm to you and the animal. Lions like all wild animals can behave in pretty unpredictable ways. Some of the factors that might cause a lion to attack you may still be unknown or hard to determine when faced with a lion. \nhttps://t.co/xOnaXppTgd Lions in Uganda are found in the Savannah parks. They are perfectly adapted to these places for hunting and rearing cubs.

But making the climb was not easy for the team. 7/13 https://t.co/6x7oEGLY6K Irvine was thought to have been carrying a Vest Pocket Kodak camera. If that camera could be found, and it held snapshots of the summit, it would rewrite the history of the world\u2019s tallest peak. 6/13 https://t.co/7ufPz8xUv0 In 1960, a Chinese climber claimed that he saw a body in a crevice at approximately 27,200 feet.

At 12:50pm, he saw them moving upward about 800 feet from the summit. 3/13 https://t.co/EW0bvIj1s9 Some think British explorer Andrew \"Sandy\" Irvine (far left) and his climbing partner, George Mallory (next to him), may have done it 29 years earlier in 1924.

The internet makes it harder to perceive the suffering of others. We have never been more connected, and yet we struggle to conceive of the reality beyond our screens.\n\nhttps://t.co/6k9IgvJIX8 This last point also counters the idea that the coronavirus was collected in nature, brought to a lab, and accidentally released.\n\nGenetics, for the win!

Here's why... https://t.co/lFOmNDoKqA This week, the World Health Organization reviewed all the evidence on airborne transmission and essentially came back with the same recommendation as before. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af https://t.co/IiAyHXv4O0 https://t.co/btf4DprzVk As @Sarah_Gibbens covered for us, a sneeze can expel respiratory droplets of various sizes 23 to 27 feet from a nose. https://t.co/qTyZlsTgWa How long is coronavirus airborne? Hard to say right now\n\nOne study showed coronavirus-filled mist can linger for up to 16 hours. But this mist was created artificially, so it doesn't say much about what happens with actual coughs/sneezes https://t.co/pKN7PPRFKT Great question! I would start by peeping this new @NatGeo story by @heroinebook  \n\ud83d\ude37\ud83d\ude37\ud83d\ude37\nIt dives into the latest developments with airborne transmission and much more: https://t.co/IiAyHXv4O0 \nhttps://t.co/QqG6zs9alY The sudden loss of visitors in the parks has driven an increase in poaching\u2014usually by locals struggling to feed their families https://t.co/tengSOCBy4 That said, a small study reported recently that COVID-19 antibodies started fading after 2-3 months.\nBut even low amounts of antibodies can still be neutralizing, so I wouldn't give up on herd immunity yet. https://t.co/7pIzCXQOZc As we've covered: These other weapons could play a crucial role for one of the leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates. https://t.co/NJiSKmvd9n Hmm, let's start by dispelling an oversimplification:\nImmunity against viruses involves more than just antibodies. Antibodies are just one part of our body's arsenal, and we're seeing encouraging signs about other critical weapons: https://t.co/tOTHHOzudG https://t.co/4ZO0rBRcum ...and some scientists wonder if those cold-causing coronaviruses were more potent back then and caused ancient pandemics.\n\nBut that's just speculation. SARS-CoV-2 is here for a while. I suspect that this misinterpretation comes from a misread of coronavirus evolution. It's thought that cold-causing coronaviruses began infecting humans roughly 800 years ago.... https://t.co/In67gDQFQP There is a bit of misinfo going around that the coronavirus will weaken over time.\n\nNo one knows for sure if that's true, as UW biologist @CT_Bergstrom has explained https://t.co/2FvM83bqjl Achieving herd immunity through natural infection would be devastating, given.... https://t.co/AsdZDuENbL https://t.co/UMSeD0U1bb Based on its behavior so far, the coronavirus will keep spreading until 60-70% of the human population becomes immune, either through natural infection or a vaccine. In other words, we need herd immunity. SARS-CoV-2 is new, and our bodies will take time to adjust/develop immunity https://t.co/5VYoBJhHW1 That\u2019s an interesting question\u2014and one that\u2019s created some public confusion.\n\nAs I hinted in a recent story, pandemic viruses tend to burn through humans like a forest https://t.co/OAqVZ9uDYc\" @TallDavid @MoNscience Answers will be added to the original post as a thread! Join @MoNscience for our next #COVID19 Q&amp;A today at 1pm ET. Leave your questions below and stay tuned for answers https://t.co/jRh7gBpONz Although conservationists are hopeful it will eventually be approved, for now, all the vaccines and antibodies used for COVID-19 in the US will be tested for safety with the help of the humble horseshoe crab. 10/10 https://t.co/su3UkRIRet While the FDA has permitted its use to test for contamination in a few drugs, the US Pharmacopeia (a non-profit that sets standards for drug safety and quality) decided not to approve rFC for use in 2020. 9/10 More recently, biologists have created a synthetic version of the lysate called recombinant Factor C (rFC), which doesn\u2019t need horseshoe crabs. In clinical tests, it works just as well as the horseshoe crab-derived lysate. 8/10 Pharma companies began collecting horseshoe crabs when they came on shore to breed and extracted their blood before returning them to the ocean. Official numbers say only ~5% of the crabs die as a result. Niles fears it\u2019s much higher. 7/10 In the 1950s, biologists realized that limulus amebocyte lysate (the official name) could be useful in detecting endotoxin in pharmaceutical products, since even tiny amounts of endotoxin contamination can be deadly. 6/10 The horseshoe crab\u2019s immune system is very different than yours or mine. When it encounters a certain type of bacterial toxin called endotoxin, it turns from a liquid into a gel, which protects them from pathogens. 5/10 In recent years, however, Niles and other horseshoe crab aficionados say their numbers are plummeting. One potential contributor is the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s use of their very strange milky blue blood. 4/10 https://t.co/gX6nNKYRHI Why Delaware Bay? The red knots\u2019 pit stop coincides with the time when horseshoe crabs are laying their eggs in mid-May.

I'm really looking forward to being at Kennedy Space Center for tomorrow's launch \u2014 or launch attempt, really hoping the weather cooperates. Ad Astra \ud83c\udf1f #LaunchAmerica Docking should be autonomous, but the crew will also be testing the vehicle's manual flight capabilities along the way. Yes! Crew Dragon will dock with the International Space Station after approximately 19 hours in flight (assuming the launch goes off tomorrow as planned). https://t.co/Xa1uLTKJsH According to this news story, it could be visible about 15-20 minutes after launch.

I think it will be interesting to see how commercial crew programs change the faces we see going to space \u2014 and I hope we'll move away from an orbital landscape that's predominantly populated by white men. https://t.co/xpEvbAeheW That said, I'm really curious to see how the economics play out over the next years and decades, and how the market for private spaceflight shapes up. I think it's great. Moving spaceflight beyond the realm of governments is a big step toward opening up space and making it more accessible for larger portions of humanity. https://t.co/kTzioIJ2ve ...I'd love to see democratized access to space, and far more people in orbit. And lastly, economics \u2014 these programs create jobs in the private sector and foster competition among industry, which could be a (figurative) boost. I can think of so many! Just a few: Inspiration \u2014 if we can pull this off in the middle of a pandemic, what else is possible? Opportunity \u2014 will commercial spaceflight truly make space more accessible?

They report no benefit for mild or severe patients, but consistent adverse effects (cardiac toxicity) https://t.co/sfloy1MiYB It has less to do with the virus (though its novelty plays a role) and more to do with our immune systems trying and failing to find an answer That's how I think of a cytokine storm. The body has recognized the lungs are infected with something serious (coronavirus). It decides to act, but the immune response goes too far and causes collateral damage Imagine you have a leaky faucet in your house? Now, imagine you try to fix it with a bulldozer https://t.co/Zknz01MjZC There are clinical trials underway to explore Vitamin C (tablets or IVs) as a COVID-19 therapy, but again, there are no results yet https://t.co/9xy8v9Yhrk Here's the thing: An IV deposits way higher amounts of Vitamin C into the body than an oral tablet. So, it is way less likely that a Vitamin C pill will have an effect on an infection like COVID-19 This \"Vitamin C\" idea comes from small studies on sepsis, where IVs of the nutrient reduced deaths. Sepsis, like COVID-19, causes the body's immune system to run amok Physicians behind that study claim the treatment reduced the length of hospital stays, but they haven't published the results One study in China has tried administering high doses of Vitamin C among severe COVID-19 patients, but the vitamin was given intravenously (via IV injection into veins) So, let's dispel this myth. Vitamin C tablets have not been shown to fight COVID-19 yet.\nhttps://t.co/xFdYG3l8ta Those excessive immune responses may be damaging the lining of the blood vessels, leading to the clots.\n\nApropos, cardiovascular disease (CVD) can make blood vessels more vulnerable to clots, which may explain why people with CVD have poorer outcomes with COVID-19 Great Q! One plausible answer centers on cytokine storms (or \"blood storms\" as we've called them) that result from our immune systems overreacting to the virus.

Allow me to introduce you to my pals on the @NatGeo animals desk. https://t.co/VdueLdJruI Health-care workers are known to have a higher risk of infection. In Spain, HCWs make up 20% of all cases, and research backs the idea of prioritizing tests for them and other groups at high-risk, in order to more quickly break chains of transmission. https://t.co/Zg1KT5zWz4 Studies on SARS (https://t.co/dah1uqHGGx) and on COVID-19 (https://t.co/eAzSxfqm7n) suggest that being closer to an afflicted person correlates with catching the disease. I haven't seen any studies on the COVID-19 inoculum needed to spawn an infection, but past animal model studies on SARS found that the dosage correlated with how much germ ultimately embedded in the lungs. https://t.co/AN5StHS2ZF The second is viral \"load\" -- or how much of the germ is multiplying within a body part. Great question! Two concepts you should know. First, there is the \"viral inoculum\" -- that's  how science folks describe the dosage of a germ exposure. https://t.co/TC89JX3Dau Whether driven by a humanitarian calling or compelled by economic survival, nearly 49 million essential workers continue to show up to work across the country https://t.co/gFc6C5vw1v Every now and again, I stop in my tracks because I remember that this coronavirus sprung from one city in China and spread across the world\u2014just 2 to 3 people at a time\u2014via breathing, coughing, talking, and touching. You should also check out her latest story about respiratory transmission. Gesundheit! https://t.co/DgDqo25AAp If you're wondering \"what's the best way to clean these surfaces?\" Peep this explainer by @Sarah_Gibbens https://t.co/GH7rui87NM If you touch a fomite carrying the coronavirus, and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, it may expose you to the virus. @AmyMcKeever wrote a great description here of possible infection routes: https://t.co/gxsAxN0HKu If your hand is contaminated, almost everything you touch--your face included--could become what's known as a \"fomite.\" That is a surface that harbors an infection. No such thing as a silly question! Viruses can't walk. But despite being immobile, they can still travel rapidly. https://t.co/ZA3BtI1IvU While some members of the coronavirus family are found in birds, past monumental strains like SARS and MERS originated in bats, moved into an intermediate mammal (like civets or camels), and then hopped into humans. https://t.co/D8Sx2UvUIt https://t.co/HxSttgzYUk The early tests that suggested reactivation only looked for the coronavirus's genetic material, rather than checking to see if the remnants were actually alive. So what happened? Violent respiratory infections create a battlefield in the lungs. Even after the body wins, it can leave behind dead pieces of the virus. This week, SK health officials announced these reactivated/reinfected cases were actually false positives. https://t.co/cKA8feM0VA Great question!

The best practice is to take the same precautions with your pets as you would with humans https://t.co/UHjpLyCdfj But yes, if a vaccine is made but immunity wanes, high-risk groups will likely need to seek regular doses of the vaccine to stay protected.\nP.S. See my answer from last week on using the term \"strain\"... https://t.co/0HD0RYCVPH The coronavirus also slowly mutates, which also may or may not influence the future durability of a vaccine response. https://t.co/C0nRlpLrKF In the past, human immunity against other coronaviruses has only lasted a 1-2 years, which would indicate the potential need for a regular vaccine. We've never had a coronavirus vaccine, despite warning shots from SARS, MERS, and the disease burden caused by common colds. https://t.co/N4SZiFvVPU\n\nScientists are working essentially from scratch, which explains why delivering a vaccine will likely take more than a year. Hard to say until we know more about how people develop immunity and how the virus changes. https://t.co/MCS2c3Bvb0 Based on available evidence, we cannot count on heat and humidity to beat the coronavirus.\n\nThings we can count on: social distancing, testing, health-care workers, critical care therapies, and, hopefully one day, a vaccine One lab reported exposing SARS-CoV-2 to 158\u00b0F, and the virus survived for 5 minutes!\nAt 132\u00b0F, the virus survived for at least 10 minutes!!!! https://t.co/lHTQc5dekR Only extreme heat and the most damaging forms of solar radiation can slow the coronavirus.\n\nHere's a list:\nS\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil: 79\u00b0F\nMiami: 88\u00b0F\nLos Angeles: 90\u00b0F\nYour body: 98\u00b0F\n\nThe virus can survive in all of these places. The question of the moment. Let's answer it this way.\n\nIf a temperature can harm the coronavirus, then it can also harm the human body.\n\nIf an amount of radiation exposure can harm the virus, then it can also harm the human body.\nhttps://t.co/f3LhshOEbp It's also easier to collect blood for an antibody test (Hey may I prick your finger?) than swab for a genetic test (Hey may I stick this Q-tip up your nose?). This benefit comes in handy for population-scale surveys, which we'll need to effectively allocate resources for COVID The starkest example is contact tracing. Because antibodies can be detected in asymptomatic cases or long after an infection clears, scientists can use these tests to track otherwise hidden chains of infection. Example:  https://t.co/QxBBcXe4sX Great Q! Antibody tests are valuable for more than just assessing whether people have immunity, as @nadiamdrake explains for @NatGeo https://t.co/3Vhk902tMa https://t.co/vNpm1Z4ohF What role have bats played in the current pandemic?

Read our ongoing coverage for free at the link above, and to support more content like this, please consider subscribing to National Geographic. https://t.co/M1Eisg0av4 As well as those in mourning https://t.co/4xWfbUYAz5 I am also more concerned about how our society can assist health-care workers through this crisis https://t.co/Dy9HVF9WbB https://t.co/0vydr2wnHR The most important questions about the origins of this virus, in my opinion, center around its animal sources. Peep these stories for info: https://t.co/HxG5QLSTxu And despite recent reports, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 came from a lab in Wuhan or anywhere else. https://t.co/6boVpCusMc These genetic features also suggest that SARS-CoV-2 emerged from nature, akin to MERS and SARS the original. In other words, it wasn't engineered. One example, SARS-CoV-2 carries \"genetic features that suggest it encountered a living immune system rather than being cultivated in a petri dish.\" https://t.co/ySJtpoN6nO As @SarahE_Richards reported for @NatGeo, genetic clues can answer this question.  https://t.co/JOwBlXuKh0 Coronaviruses in general can also survive extreme cold (-20 deg Celsius) for years. \n\nPeople should also keep in the mind that the virus can survive within our bodies, which are very hot (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit / 37 degrees Celsius). Long story short: SARS-CoV-2 appears able to survive high heat/humidity, given its spread in places like bath houses and in countries like Iran. It has also been shown to survive refrigeration. https://t.co/ZwdHTZU3yK We've published a couple stories on the temperature topic, including one earlier today. https://t.co/SO4vuWVZnT We won't know if any of these mutations have created a functional difference in behavior until more studies are conducted. Thousands, not 8, mutations have been recorded for SARS-CoV-2, since the virus was isolated from the first cases in China.\n\nBut people need to keep in mind that most mutations are benign and don't change a virus's behavior, namely how it interacts with us. \"Strain\" is an imperfect term, but it generally means that a mutated version of a virus is behaving in a completely new way. In other words, it is functionally different. As of right now, there is only one known strain of SARS-CoV-2. The reports of 8 strains are incorrect. https://t.co/r6O0S7K0iO This double-punch is what has shut down much of the world. COVID-19 spreads so fast that we're struggling to even track it and is also very hazardous. As a result, COVID-19 spreads more readily than those two predecessors. But akin to \"SARS the original\" and MERS, COVID-19 likes to invade the lower respiratory tract, namely the lungs where it creates chaos. https://t.co/DqDx7UrgUx How much time do we have? \ud83d\ude05\nReal answer: The upper respiratory tract.\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19, readily implants itself in the upper respiratory tract (mouth, nose, upper throat). That's unlike its close cousins, the original SARS and MERS. https://t.co/YGtC3nEvKx RT @NatGeo: Great Q! Let's break it down by the type of test, namely \"genetic\" versus \"antibody.\" As @nadiamdrake reported, genetic tests c\u2026 The solution: Test early, test often, turnaround tests quickly (what many places are struggling with), and then trace contacts as quickly/thoroughly as possible. This pattern helps explain why the world is having so much trouble with containing COVID-19. The disease is spreading before we're even aware that we need to run a genetic test. Here's the catch: The latest evidence suggests  that people start spreading COVID-19 days before their symptoms starts. This study estimated nearly half of those with COVID-19 (44%) spread the disease 2.3 days before their symptoms arrived. https://t.co/VdfMt97BHl Antibody tests, in contrast, screen a person's blood for the long-lasting hallmarks of immunity, but this immunity takes 10 to 14 days to show up. https://t.co/8SsPu1Nhfr In other words, genetic tests are great for the early days. Antibody tests are awesome for the later days. Great Q! Let's break it down by the type of test, namely \"genetic\" versus \"antibody.\" As @nadiamdrake reported, genetic tests can spot the coronavirus and its RNA in the early stages of an infection but only work as long as the virus is present in the body https://t.co/e5huuoDKaH These two very different species use the same facial expressions while having fun, suggesting the behavior is rooted deep in evolution https://t.co/KDHyRorRQV Join us for our second Q&amp;A with @MoNscience about the coronavirus pandemic today at 12pm.

Follow me (@MoNscience) for more updates and keep an eye out for our ongoing coverage here: https://t.co/hm3AGYyOYJ Tl;dr: I know it's tough to be away from friends and loved ones for so long. But health care workers are really counting on us to \"flatten the curve\" by doing things like social distancing and washing our hands. If you stay vigilant, you can literally save lives. But the verdict is unclear, and the CDC advises hospitals to consider these extended windows while managing patients. https://t.co/COpS5GnQyH The mere presence of viral RNA doesn't necessarily mean that a person is also shedding the whole virus. It could just be lifeless fragments. But studies have found that coronavirus patients shed the virus's genetic material, a potential indicator of being contagious, for up to 37 days. (The median range was 12-20 days.) Asymptomatic cases also shed SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA.\n\nThe caveat... Think of \"two weeks\" as the rough estimate for how long it takes to develop symptoms. Most cases develop symptoms by at least 14 days. The best thing you can do right now, to protect yourself and keep hospitals from being overwhelmed, is social distance. Here's why.\nhttps://t.co/0L9vwkkrOt TIL: Coronaviruses in general are very stable in a frozen state, according to the WHO.

A large amount of virus would be need to be in the water, and the ocean would likely be weakening the germ.\nTl;dr: Just don't swim near sewage. If the runoff hits the ocean, I don't see why the virus wouldn't survive. SARS coronavirus, a close relative of the novel virus, could survive in urine. Ocean water is 10 times as a salty as urine, but viruses are known to survive in it. All that said... This is a fascinating question. First, drinking water should be fine if it has gone through a treatment plant.\nhttps://t.co/bwd2D97UgI And this story by yours truly  https://t.co/kSGzaOYJjW In 20 percent of cases, it does a bunch of very bad things.

Studies have shown coronaviruses (including the novel one) is \"highly stable\" at 4 degrees Celsius, the typical temperature for a refrigerator. https://t.co/lHTQc5dekR https://t.co/umHFDWh0CR That's based on what virologists and epidemiologists are saying about past experiences with human immunity to coronaviruses (cold-causing varieties in particular) and because COVID-19 is so contagious. If I (@monscience) was forced to guess, I would bet that COVID-19 sticks around, either as multiple phases or as a seasonal disease.

Plus, pandemics are more dependent on how our societies exist (i.e., urbanization, global travel) than on random mutations. \"Mutations\" get a bad rap. Most mutations, including the ones with viruses, are benign. Also, living things are constantly mutating without harm being caused. You're mutating. Corn is mutating. Nope! We can actually use those mutations to track the outbreak's spread, especially with cases that are missed due to the lack of tests. See our story by @SarahE_Richards https://t.co/qd0gWxjCDt https://t.co/0EiHe03j1l (Note: Homeopathic vaccines are not the same as conventional vaccines, the latter of which have a long history of success.) The good news: Some COVID-19 patients are developing immunity! That's a good sign for a potential vaccine, but we need to see how long this immunity lasts for the novel strain. With cold-causing coronaviruses, immunity lasts for a year or two. https://t.co/JswiZf5Vb9 Scientists need time to make sure these candidates work (i.e., can generate a beneficial immune response). Great question and great timing!

Also: https://t.co/bUMnFpq8w0 Tigers are also individual living creatures. As many as 10,000 live in captivity in the U.S., many in inappropriate conditions. Tigers are endangered. There are only ~3,900 left in the wild. https://t.co/0W1vlAYa0G Two separate things I always ask people to keep in mind when thinking about wild animals:\n\n1. Conservation  \n2. Welfare @miles2025 @Rachael_Bale We've got a really in-depth story on that exact topic. Tigers, elephants, monkeys, bears and more https://t.co/BdRZx4t6YJ There are several tiger subspecies, each adapted to its specific habitat. But because most captive tigers are \"generic\"\u2014of mixed bloodlines\u2014they are not allowed to be part of the captive-breeding conservation programs that accredited zoos participate in. All of this captive-breeding of privately owned tigers in the U.S. is not considered useful for conservation, scientists say. @BrazenBackpack @Rachael_Bale That way breeding is coordinated to ensure genetic diversity within a population https://t.co/6KiTarSYDQ @BrazenBackpack @Rachael_Bale The best zoos in the U.S. breed in accordance with the Species Survival Plan of that particular animal. The AZA keeps a studbook for animals in these breeding programs, to track their pedigrees. Elsewhere, tigers are bred in captivity to be slaughtered for the illegal trade in their skins, bones, teeth, and claws. Sometimes the facilities are legal, sometimes not. The illegal wildlife trade is one of the biggest threats to tigers in the wild. https://t.co/F9LuMjNjMR Joe Exotic isn't just in prison for plotting to have someone killed. He was also convicted on charges related to killing five of his tigers and illegally trading wildlife. https://t.co/hlInZ2G8eU You may have noticed all the white tigers in the show. DYK the white tiger is not a separate species? It's just a tiger that's white. They're extremely uncommon in the wild, but because people love the novelty, they've been intensively bred in captivity. Inbred, actually. @BioTechDirt @Rachael_Bale This provides some tips to help guide you. https://t.co/5afPLgQBn3 @BioTechDirt @Rachael_Bale The most important thing is to do your research before you go spend money to see tigers. You can also raise awareness among your friends and family\u2014most people, even if they love animals, don't know about the many issues tigers in captivity face. @Zarl95 Many captive tigers are also a mix of subspecies, and because each is adapted for a specific environment, it wouldn't be good for wild populations to be introduced to genes from another subspecies @Zarl95 Unfortunately, no. They wouldn't be able to fend for themselves since they've never lived in the wild before. @daisyrothschild We have just what you're looking for! https://t.co/QwoFzOsPO0 @shashankkhemani @Rachael_Bale Yes, white tigers have been intensively bred in the U.S. and therefore some have health problems. The American Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the main accrediting organization for U.S. zoos, prohibits its members from breeding them for this reason. There's a wide range of zoos, too, from shabby roadside menageries to state-of-the-art parks like the San Diego Zoo. If you're not sure how to judge, we have some tips here. https://t.co/aiMaX6DPwz @ParrisBueller @Rachael_Bale It's not just about the price\u2014it's the patchwork of laws in the U.S. too. Some states have bans or partial bans, some states require you get a license, some states don't regulate ownership at all. @silye0n @Rachael_Bale The recurring cost of food can add up\u2014tigers eat a lot. Plus vitamins/minerals, veterinary care, liability insurance. There's the cost of building a big enclosure (materials and labor), transportation for when you need to move the cat (forklift!)...it adds up. @silye0n @Rachael_Bale This story is related and may interest you\u2014climate change is pushing more people into the mangrove swamps who are increasingly desperate and turning to poaching.\u00a0https://t.co/80SYIL3Rps @silye0n @Rachael_Bale Climate change is a real threat. In India and Bangladesh, Bengal live in the world's largest mangrove forest, which is being eroded because of sea level rise. Siberian tigers, farther north, are being affected by warming temperatures harming their prey. Pseudo-sanctuaries abound, as @natashadaly and @kirstenluce found in their investigation of wildlife tourism around the world. https://t.co/dIB2UxSHXW One question I've gotten a lot is: What's the difference between Joe Exotic's zoo and Big Cat Rescue? A real sanctuary is a rescue organization. It doesn't breed or allow hands-on interactions, and it doesn't make animals perform or entertain. Cubs can only interact with visitors from eight weeks old to 12 weeks, the law says. What's next? A life of breeding or exhibition maybe. There's evidence that some surplus tigers are killed. Places like Joe Exotic's make their money by offering cub-petting. Who wouldn't want to play with a baby tiger? But that requires a constant supply of cubs\u2014and in the end, there are a whole lot of adult tigers to feed. Then what? There are more tigers in captivity in the U.S. than there are left in the wild. Most are privately owned, in roadside zoos, pseudo-sanctuaries, and backyards. This is a problem for a number of reasons. Our feature by @sguynup and @swfoto does a deep dive https://t.co/qNczqTigFt Hi, I'm @rachael_bale, executive editor of Nat Geo's animals desk.

Check out my colleague Nina Strochlic\u2019s story on the women who pioneered deep sea exploration: https://t.co/wsWAVO3ASB The U.S. isn\u2019t a major producer or consumer of shark fins, but its location along trade routes means that it serves as a transport hub for them https://t.co/Rz7efcFXjm Rising demand, hoarding, and misuse are increasingly disrupting the global supply of protective equipment for health workers https://t.co/NAGLRakjRh @ViicNoMato @natashaldaly All of those skills are important!

But also learn about issues you care about\u2014if you're immersed in a subject, you're likely to find great, unique stories to pursue @kirstenluce Continue the thread here https://t.co/ykU6TlJTG3 @Rachael_Bale Thanks so much for sticking with me all day! Happy to continue answering questions, and thank you for reading :) @Rachael_Bale If you like our wildlife journalism and want to support our continued coverage of these kinds of stories, please consider subscribing to National Geographic. https://t.co/yUoGRjqyIq https://t.co/JBAG8q004R @Rachael_Bale Reporting on wildlife exploitation can be challenging. It\u2019s painful to witness suffering. But animals don\u2019t have voices; they can\u2019t tell their own stories. I hope our journalism can help illuminate the struggles of creatures we share the planet with, and inspire people to care. https://t.co/VIeYwaLkVY @xrprof @natashaldaly My colleagues @Rachael_Bale and @JaniActman reported on a film about what it's like to be a ranger in Garamba National Park. I think it's a good example of how immersive technologies can be used to raise awareness about conservation: https://t.co/PnGQ5XFncy @AnupamkPandey @natashaldaly Here's the story of their rescue: https://t.co/xFoSDnr9qr \nWhen I saw Allegra the manatee again in October, she was thriving. Eventually, she'll be released back into the wild. It's rare to come face to face with happy endings like this, so it was special to me! https://t.co/ikijU4VhEt @AnupamkPandey @natashaldaly I had a really cool full-circle moment in October in Iquitos, Peru. I met a manatee at a rescue center that I'd first reported on two years earlier, when she and dozens of other animals were being illegally held for tourists to take photos with. @Rachael_Bale I know it would be tough to read about. We're always looking for light. https://t.co/Rml3j4EBXw @Rachael_Bale That's what's heartening about reporting on crises facing wildlife: for every instance of death or abuse, there are people trying to help. If this beat was all doom and gloom, it'd be tough to write about. Happy #WorldWildlifeDay! Today at 1pm EST photojournalist Brent Stirton will be doing a @reddit AMA to talk about his work covering the illegal wildlife trade. Start posting your questions now! https://t.co/8UX2wT3IOo https://t.co/mr3iFJOubx @Rachael_Bale On Australia\u2019s Kangaroo Island, devastated by fire, video emerged of teens filling a car with rescued koalas. Writer Kennedy Warne documented scientists racing to understand if some endemic species were lost forever, and vets racing to treat the injured: https://t.co/p6xF1HS9y0 @Rachael_Bale In southern Australia, when thousands of flying foxes suffocated in 100-degree heat in prime birthing season, volunteers raced to rescue as many orphans as possible. \u201cSome we get to in time,\u201d one volunteer told me. \u201cOthers die in your hand.\u201d https://t.co/VDYDnKzDuk @Rachael_Bale But the wildfires also put a spotlight on peoples\u2019 heart for animals. I reported on a group of volunteers in fire-devastated Bolivia who turned a hotel into a makeshift rescue center for burned wildlife. Every day, they would search the ash for survivors: https://t.co/7KdHCIYCS5 @Rachael_Bale The Amazon is home to 10% of the planet's animal species. In the Amazon, nothing is adapted to fire. When unprecedented wildfire ignited up to 3,500 square miles of the rainforest in 2019, wildlife suffered on a scale that will likely never be clear: https://t.co/OdrnXimNqB @Rachael_Bale When you report on this stuff, it gets morbid and elemental. Animals have few choices: Hide, be displaced, or perish. In extreme wildfire, for lots animals, it's the latter. And in the Amazon, as one scientist told me, \u201cwe may lose species without ever knowing they were there.\u201d @ShayeMarr @natashaldaly I have too many to pick a favorite. The best part of my job is, hands down, the wonderful people I work with. One memory that sticks out was last May, when @kirstenluce and I saw our Wildlife Tourism story in print for the very first time! \ud83d\ude2d https://t.co/Q0mZwSrMyx @Rachael_Bale We do a lot of reporting on how humans exploit animals en masse: for entertainment, food, body parts, and as pets. But mass incineration of wildlife\u2014again and again this year\u2014was new for me. Wildfire death ended up becoming this emerging coverage beat that I got but never wanted. My colleague @Rachael_Bale investigated the pangolin trade last year: https://t.co/ufZ7l0Xk7w No one knows which animal spread the virus to humans. One possibility: pangolins, one of the world\u2019s most trafficked mammals. The scaly creatures are poached and killed for their meat and scales, which are highly coveted for traditional Chinese medicine. @kirstenluce @rfobar @swfoto @sguynup Another crisis facing wildlife: the global trade in wild animals for food and parts and pets. Coronavirus thrust this trade into the spotlight\u2014The zoonotic disease spread in a Chinese wildlife market where live animals were sold for food: https://t.co/GPPrsAs019 @kirstenluce @rfobar Did you know more tigers live in captivity in the U.S. alone than remain in the wild? Sometimes the best way to make change is to look in our own backyards. How many roadside zoos does your state have? December's story, by @swfoto and @sguynup: https://t.co/yo0YH4ABXq @_justlanded_ @NatGeoTravel @natashaldaly This is very kind! But many days I\u2019m just at my desk, staring at a blank screen, trying to get words on the page! \ud83d\ude06 @sea_alert1 @natashaldaly For me\u2014no. I believe very strongly in completely objective journalism. Objectivity is crucial to building trust with readers. My job is always to present facts, and let readers form their own judgments. It\u2019s how this work can be most effective. @RLewis_UIowa @natashaldaly @bittelmethis Great question. For every crisis facing animals, there are people trying to help. I try to look for the light whenever I can. Stay tuned a bit later in the day when I'll be sharing some stories of hope. For those curious: https://t.co/qUxkmcQS8a @kirstenluce We\u2019ve continued our reporting on the wildlife tourism trade, and how it links into sport hunting and wildlife trafficking. My colleague @rfobar reported on abuse at a lion farm in South Africa: https://t.co/2PPtWFPme7 @joe_green79 @natashaldaly I\u2019m actually Canadian! This photo was taken in Iceland :) @ms_1512 Check out our guide to vetting wildlife experiences for yourself. I suggest thinking twice about a tiger facility that allows interaction with the animals, which is a major red flag https://t.co/hK1vMjoUUT @gretacrossphoto @natashaldaly I studied history and then worked as an editor in academia for several years before jumping to journalism. My #1 tip: carve out a focus that you're passionate about. Being an expert in one area will help you stand out quicker than spreading yourself thin over a bunch of genres. @Coconi_z @natashaldaly Yes\u2014absolutely. There are efforts underway all over the world. But unlike land development or poaching or other actions that threaten animals and their habitats immediately, effects of climate change often take years, or decades, to become clear. The second was Gloria Hollister Anable who set a world record during this expedition for deepest dive by a woman\u2014at 1,208 feet. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/s2xQEXZqVP @akashmishra9801 @natashaldaly I love animals. They don't have a voice. By telling their stories I feel like I can help illuminate issues facing wildlife that may otherwise be really difficult to see. @deshbhkt_ @natashaldaly I almost always work together with a photographer in the field. @kirstenluce and I spent three months in the field together for Wildlife Tourism. For investigative stories, it makes all the difference to have a partner to work through puzzles with https://t.co/cLhoCxVHNj @deshbhkt_ @natashaldaly I take: computer, notebooks, phone, lots of bug spray, first aid, and laundry detergent packets. Hats with drawstrings for boats. Portable battery packs! (I never have these when I need them...) I travel with a local assistant to help translate, arrange logistics &amp; find sources @kirstenluce Have you seen or participated in wild animal entertainment activities while traveling? (Tips and guidelines for ethical animal encounters here: https://t.co/cnp8TMYLN5) @kirstenluce It\u2019s been 10 months since the story published and I still get emails and DMs every single day from couples who changed their honeymoon plans, or students who have done school projects on our story. This was an animal abuse story that people saw themselves in. It hit differently. @kirstenluce 70,000 people signed a petition calling for the rescue of an abused elephant in our story. Six weeks after our story published, he was rescued. His happy ending is a symbol of the power people have to make incremental change. Read about his new life here: https://t.co/ApUHcrGFwQ Last May, photographer @kirstenluce and I reported on animal suffering in the captive wildlife tourism industry. We did it because social media drives demand, and in turn abuse, and we knew that most people had no idea. You can read it here: https://t.co/Sa6HB09Z6w https://t.co/68NVS6OAca We have a dedicated investigative reporting project focused on wildlife crime and exploitation. These issues are always nuanced and often multinational. There is never a shortage of stories to tell. Read more about the project here: https://t.co/YSjqi0ch39 At NatGeo, we\u2019ve always told stories about wildlife. But in 2019, a clear theme emerged: animals, as they\u2019re affected by us. When we write about how animals\u2019 lives are shaped by their environments, it\u2019s impossible to take ourselves out of the equation. https://t.co/1gX0vq2Ad7 Hi!
