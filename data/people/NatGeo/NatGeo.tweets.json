How we navigate, connect &amp; co-exist in a limited space with limited resources. But it's the greatest\u2014and most difficult\u2014of journeys and one we all have a role in contributing to. https://t.co/QA4g344OGd 35/35 https://t.co/wbbS0S9n9x Both require maintenance, or else they collapse. And in this regard, both represent our planet and the way we need to live and maintain it. 34/35 https://t.co/FTjZI9w86g In that moment, I realized that we needed the road to guide us to where we wanted to go. We needed the bridge to connect us to one another, to create access between people and place. 33/35 https://t.co/F2mlvaPGWA Underneath all the movement was the road, the bridge\u2014the infrastructure that connected one side to the other, nature to society. 32/35 When we crossed the Golden Gate Bridge into San Francisco, I looked back to marvel at what we had accomplished. 800 miles. 2.5 weeks. Over 50,000 ft of elevation gain. Cars zoomed on either side. Horns blasted, engines roared. Everything, everyone seemed to be in motion. 31/35 https://t.co/gI34pmOE7a Her dance, a blend of traditional Pomo style &amp; modern movements, is a direct result of that\u2014preservation as an act of movement; movement as an act of adaptation. https://t.co/hypURhu8KR (Video by @omg_lmg) 30/35 https://t.co/xlorpLkAqw Bernadette taught me that you must move, take action, actively try to preserve &amp; educate, heal &amp; communicate. 29/35 As I sat there and listened, I wondered what would happen if the thing I relied on for subsistence, the thing that formed the basis of my identity, slowly disappeared. This was a story of loss as much as it was about renewal. 28/35 Acorns grow on Chishkale, also known as tan oak trees. But these trees have been dying due to sudden oak death, an airborne pathogen, and rising temperatures are expected to increase the spread. https://t.co/3T4vsy10hj 27/35 But climate change is putting that identity at risk, particularly with one of their most staple foods\u2014the acorn. 26/35 Slowly, she opened her world to us. For the Pomo, land is their source of life, a source of physical strength and spiritual connection. Nature is an essential part of who they are. https://t.co/h3afBHbofv 25/35 We ended up eating at the same Thai restaurant; chili-streaked noodles and three empty tables stood between us. The social distance didn\u2019t prevent conversation. 24/35 https://t.co/xbsBVS1QBR We saw Bernadette dancing in a parking lot, the doors to her blue pickup open, salsa music blasting. She and her partner laughed as they missed a spin. 23/35 https://t.co/Mp3flhgbEO That hope continued to be challenged then restored, lost then fortified, with the story of one Pomo Native American woman and her fight to preserve Pomo culture against the backdrop of climate change. 22/35 We chose to keep biking, to see the journey through. And somehow, we made it. The winds changed, the firefighters risked their lives; we held onto the hope that everything was going to be okay. 21/35 https://t.co/tYXIjoUFZa We had a decision to make: do we stay or do we go? Continue forward or call it quits? We checked the air quality maps. Reds and purples flashed PPM levels, warning of hazardous conditions. https://t.co/fthRwOeF2i 20/35 That week, the sky oscillated from an apolycatic yellow to a dull gray. 1,000,000 acres burned. 40,000 people fled their homes. And that was just in Oregon. https://t.co/ZgtjvNXntx 19/35 The concept of change followed us everywhere. We moved from Oregon to California, from clear coasts to wildfires. Everyday we had a set path, and everyday, we had to adjust and adapt to the reality before us. 18/35 https://t.co/a4lsgCNb8b As we rode out the next day, we waved at the local fishers, our hands numb with the morning cold. I felt like change here was happening quietly, subtly, over time, and so we must too, to preserve what matters. 17/35 https://t.co/IALiTxO94e This was a story of adaptation, of how to support a multi-million dollar industry and a local way of life through careful chemical controls in light of a changing ocean. 16/35 We looked at the wind-battered sign detailing state rules for the daily catch. Small boats were on the water. We could make out buckets and nets, boots and overalls. It all felt so quiet. 15/35 https://t.co/BcLvacDsb9 In 2006-2008, oyster larvae began to die in rapid numbers. Ocean acidification\u2014the absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere into the water\u2014makes it difficult for them to form the shells they need to survive. https://t.co/wxeP670SLr 14/35 The bay is a well-mixed estuary\u2014the river empties into the sea; salt water mixes with freshwater, and salinity levels are constant from top to bottom. https://t.co/gZsrr6nw2W 13/35 60 miles on the first day took us straight into Netarts Bay, a small oceanside community famous for its oysters and clams. 12/35 https://t.co/qi7xO6z2ho It was the closest I\u2019ve ever felt to being biologically human, and the closest I\u2019ve ever been to understanding climate change. 11/35 There was often no wifi, with some stretches of road devoid of food or drink for 30 or more miles. Our bodies were the only things that propelled us forward. We were our own energy. 10/35 https://t.co/gqL4X8n3Tp For 6-8 hours a day, we were on our bikes\u2014riding through forests, on the edge of steep cliffs and the shoulder of single-lane highways\u2014exposed to the elements, the wind currents from speeding cars, the loud horns of RVs and transport trucks. 9/35 https://t.co/g6V34VwGND To feel it intimately, in the outdoors, watching the horizons change and the landscapes shift, moving in and out of diverse communities united by the experience of this climatic shift. 8/35 But it felt necessary. How could we tell a story about the changing planet without experiencing that change ourselves? 7/35 We weren\u2019t bike people. We were breakdancers, storytellers. Bike touring? It was our first time. https://t.co/ysFNOjCK3z 6/35 With my partner Cory, we began a journey that took us through 33 communities, 12 counties, 7.8429\u00b0 of latitude, four climatic regions, two states, and a single divided nation. https://t.co/GmEkix1HDi 5/35 This year, COVID rocked our world.

Yet they often go unrecognized. So let's amplify their voices. Let's catalyze positive change by telling stories. For a joyful and inspired #WomensHistoryMonth! 18/19 https://t.co/CRTQO8g2fO She works many jobs to make these dreams come true. But when COVID-19 hit, her family &amp; community battled food insecurity. Determined to survive, Reyna organized the women in her town to start a local soup kitchen that now feeds 100+ people daily\u2014including their children. 17/19 https://t.co/nPq6YdiA8P I also admire every parent &amp; educator raising the next generation of scientists worldwide, especially during this pandemic. An incredible example is Reyna Meza Montes' story from Per\u00fa. Her 3 children dream of becoming a mechanical engineer, a medical scientist &amp; a chef. 16/19 https://t.co/SjJ9B550ID 3) @RutEqp for creating KillaLab that planned on sending a mini lab to the moon.\n4) Dr. Julia Tejada for her incredible discoveries in the evolution of Amazonian mammals. \n5) @FromCaliToMars for hunting life on Mars &amp; reminding us that anything is possible with hard work. 15/19 https://t.co/b6l8ToDxS8 I admire many extraordinary scientists &amp; today I'd like to highlight some of them: \n1) Dr. @peixotors for her outstanding work in developing marine probiotics to protect coral reefs.\n2) Dr. Gretty Villena-Ch\u00e1vez for her leading work in bioprospecting and engineering fungi. 14/19 https://t.co/j9voa8OTY6 As the first scientist in my family, I didn't have a scientist role model I could relate to when I was little. Somebody that looked and spoke like me. So I'm thrilled that voices are getting amplified. Because representation drives change, and diversity inspires innovation. 13/19 Growing up in Per\u00fa, my grandmother instilled in me a profound sense of respect and love for nature. In spite of not knowing how to read or write, she taught me education is our greatest hope in protecting our Pachamama (Mother Earth). So now I honor nature through science. 12/19 https://t.co/dGhPJdju6f Otherwise, how can we protect what we don't understand? 11/19 ...we'll create the 1st local microbial database to facilitate Amazonian research. We must study the Amazonia as a whole &amp; incorporate microbial knowledge in conservation strategies so that we have a fighting change in preserving it &amp; ensure a healthy future for our planet. 10/19 https://t.co/232xnLaiBD With @microamazon, we study Amazonian extremophiles at @davidhsumich lab in @UMLifeSciences, where I complete my Ph.D. As a first step, we're documenting unexplored species &amp; dissecting their chemistry to understand how they can survive at brutal temperatures. Ultimately... 9/19 https://t.co/CDzPKyMTc1 Until now. Along with an extraordinary team @georuzo, we are exploring the Boiling River of the Peruvian Amazon, one of the world's largest thermal rivers.

Time, says one infectious disease expert, \u201cis the only thing that can tell us.\u201d https://t.co/JlLOnUqpYW The speedy development of vaccines is bringing joy daily to people posting photos of vaccinations\u2014and the hope, someday, of a return to a normal life. Even some animals are getting vaccinated. https://t.co/1DiGbwQcbD Silver lining?

More in her thread: https://t.co/vRoLsjMcSl Right now, the best available science says get a vaccine as soon as you\u2019re able, #WearAMask in public, and keep your distance for just a little while longer. Oh, and be kind to yourself and others. In my experience, that\u2019s the best way to battle pandemic stress. \u201cThe needle of public opinion is clearly tilted towards relaxation, but with the high rate of current infections in the U.S. and the variants of concern on the rise, we may regret it,\u201d @HopkinsMedicine prof Stuart C. Ray tells writer @SarahE_Richards https://t.co/YFvUoElaFy So yes, the pandemic has been messing with our heads. Now that we have vaccines, we have a measure of hope. But I join the chorus imploring everyone to not ease up yet. We have a way to go before herd immunity, and virus variants could spell trouble if not tamped down quickly. To cope, people have adopted pets, indulged in nostalgia trips, and planned aspirational vacations. I've been falling down culinary wells on YouTube. Forget sourdough: The real achievement is baking the bread eaten in Pompeii in A.D. 79 https://t.co/Wuz6klGh6W In this later stage, writer Nicole Johnson found that people are procrastinating more in response to prolonged emotional tension.

Though Julia also points out that increased comfort with video calls can benefit the neurodiverse, who may struggle with filler talk and other excess sensory triggers that clutter a meeting irl And who in 2019 could have predicted \u201czoom fatigue\u201d would become a common ailment? But also last April, writer @ByJuliaSklar explored the neurological and psychological responses people are having to all manner of video chats. https://t.co/iv1dKRNAL3 As Rebecca so eloquently puts it, @Harvard prof Deirdre Barrett and other researchers studying the phenomenon found that \u201cpandemic dreams are being colored by stress, isolation, and changes in sleep patterns\u2014a swirl of negative emotions that set them apart from typical dreaming.\u201d Of course, the situation has yielded some truly unexpected effects, too. In April, writer @RebeccaRennerFL stunned our whole newsroom with this (highly relatable) report on why the pandemic is giving people unusual dreams: https://t.co/tjzavGBfAI Now, after a full year, it\u2019s clear that our inherently social species really suffers under prolonged stress and isolation. \u201cWe\u2019re all walking around with some mild cognitive impairment,\u201d UC Irvine neuroscientist @mike_yassa recently told @TheAtlantic. https://t.co/0tOS8l1g68 As my colleague @CraigAWelch noted back in April 2020, social scientists were worried from the start that stay-at-home orders would take a toll. Not even a month in, people were buying more cigarettes, alcohol, and guns\u2014signs of coping mechanisms at work. https://t.co/WAUkLqW3mF Grief. Anxiety. Anger. Boredom. Fear. We\u2019ve been grappling with a cornucopia of difficult emotions triggered by the pandemic.

I\u2019m @vmjaggard99, the executive editor for science @NatGeo, and I\u2019m here to talk about your brain. Here\u2019s mine, which I can attest is feeling some strain after a year of COVID-19: https://t.co/Z2ZuafRPHD Passing the mic to @BijalPTrivedi for a look at inequities exposed by the pandemic. Follow her thread here: https://t.co/UiPWM0Hre1 Unless we fight for equality, and eliminate health disparities and digital divides we can\u2019t defeat COVID-19 or any other pandemic. \u201cThis pandemic has magnified every existing inequality in our society\u2014like systemic racism, gender inequality, and poverty,\u201d says Melinda Gates. https://t.co/jcyhkPX3W5 The pandemic exposed and exacerbated educational inequalities. Some 40% of African American and 30% of Latinx students received no K-12 online learning during the pandemic\u2014compared with just 10% of whites. https://t.co/9D2IY865C4 About 77 million people in the U.S. lack home internet\u2014this digital divide disproportionately prevents people of color and some of the elderly and economically disadvantaged families from scheduling appointments\u2014and getting vaccinated. https://t.co/lXYHeCY0Rm Bad news: \"Healthcare deserts\" in and around communities of color are impeding vaccination efforts. Black and Latinx Americans are being vaccinated at much slower rates than white adults. https://t.co/TbgL3bNgY0 Good news: a recent survey shows that 61 percent of Black adults have either received a first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine or plan to be vaccinated\u2014up from 42 percent four months ago. https://t.co/mlhBdJw3FY The pandemic revealed gaping holes in the healthcare system. Vulnerable populations including prisoners and the homeless suffered more because of the lockdowns and isolation. People battling drug addiction were particularly at risk. https://t.co/fefQfCPBGN Black Americans have died at 1.4 times the rate of whites: as of March 7, at least 73,462 Black lives have been lost. https://t.co/KPMoWxw3MW Black and Latinx communities\u2013\u2013with greater underlying health conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, large households, urban neighborhoods and many essential workers\u2013\u2013have battled large numbers of seriously ill people and many deaths. I'm @BijalPTrivedi senior science editor @NatGeo. When the #pandemic hit a year ago I assumed the virus was an equal opportunity killer. None of us knew it would ravage some communities more than others, laying bare ugly inequities and racism. https://t.co/A4HiLvHAw2 The group of volunteer experts behind @DearPandemic has become a valuable resource for thousands of followers who turn to its website and social media channels every day for reliable #COVID19 information https://t.co/4ulKrAxhi8 First up is photo editor @mallorybenedict on visual storytelling during a pandemic.

Esther Ruth Mbabazi explored memories of her late father. \u201cI had a lot of time to look inwards, to sit with the quiet and be present. I missed my father. This is my way of preserving the memories I have of him.\u201d https://t.co/2lgGl7XHJs There were also those for whom quarantine was dangerous. Irina Unruh documented the increase in domestic violence in Germany during #COVID19. \u201cThis picture reminds me that domestic violence doesn\u2019t start with bruises on the skin. [It] begins with words and takes many forms.\u201d https://t.co/4bGYIp5aVD For many refugees, a life in transit ground to a screeching halt. Photographer Ziyah Gafic documented migrants stuck in Bosnia en route to Europe. \u201cThey all share the same unbreakable hope that whenever they reach their final destination the life will be better.\u201d https://t.co/P6kus9sAN5 Humans weren\u2019t the only ones affected by the virus. Gab Mejia documented the impact on wildlife and their guardians, as a ranger says goodbye to the lone captive bred Tamaraw, an icon in the Philippinens. \u201cWildlife rangers\u2026have dedicated their lives in saving this rare species.\u201d https://t.co/sRn34MwEUa The disproportionate impact of #COVID19 on Black Americans revealed deeper systemic issues for photographer Rita Harper. \u201cThis project brought to my attention the dire need for radical change in providing fresh and healthy foods to our communities,\u201d she said. https://t.co/06pdiMjupD This year was also a time to reconnect with tradition, nature, and community. For First Nations photographer Pat Kane, \u201cThere seems to be a collective rallying cry to band together, support neighbors, have patience and enjoy what we have while we have it.\u201d https://t.co/1yplodlNkV I saw themes of resilience amidst tragedy. Kataleya (center) is a transgender Honduran woman stuck in Mexico after the border closed due to #COVID19. Photographer Danielle Villasana said, \u201cthis image\u2026 reminds me of the joyous moments that bring light to the pandemic's darkness.\u201d https://t.co/Zs9ZkdabAU Despite a year of immense loss, new life felt even more precious. This self-portrait by Bethany Mollenkof is one of my favorites. \u201cTo grow a life in such dark times of death felt powerful and I wanted to document it for my daughter,\u201d she said. https://t.co/dgyisdG3fc I noticed photographers connecting to stories on a more personal level. Florence Goupil covered the importance of healing plants in the Shipibo-Konibo community in Peru. \u201cI saw them take refuge in their origin, in their forest. And I let myself take refuge with them,\u201d she said. https://t.co/gccSjHh5R1 During the pandemic, @InsideNatGeo launched an emergency fund for journalists to cover #COVID19 within their own communities.

We'll look for this little bear family again in the summer in order to see how many cubs survived. 11/14 https://t.co/QOnoZ4l5b2 We determine how many cubs, the sex ratio, their size and weight, and we usually give them each a small ear tag with an ID number, so we can more easily monitor them from a distance when we look for them in the summer. 10/14 https://t.co/uWsu4RqoPF The next part is the best! While part of the team begins collecting data on the mama bear, I give the cubs their checkup. Since they can't control their own body heat at this young age, I have to snuggle them in my jacket to keep them warm before they go back to the den. 9/14 https://t.co/W3uhXNyS6B Next, we dig a bit until we can see the adult bear, and then quickly give her a sedative to keep her asleep during our procedure. Once she's fully asleep, we reach into the den and carefully pull out the cubs that should be about 6-8 weeks old. 8/14 https://t.co/EGZtJo9ZgX First, we locate the den.

From learning to drive a jet boat in a fast flowing glacial river, to getting a 1-ton truck unstuck from very buggy wetland, to slinging gear in a helicopter and flying a drone. 9/23 https://t.co/3e89sjci2U Arctic fieldwork is always an adventure. Often it takes blood (donated to mosquitos), sweat and tears to overcome the challenges that come your way. In those moments outside of my comfort zone, it is the support of others around me that gives me the confidence to continue. 8/23 https://t.co/ab2YSnffA4 What brought me to the Arctic was the science of ecology\u2014the study of how life on earth interacts with the environment.

But it hasn\u2019t always gotten the attention or action it deserves. Movement leaders and researchers got the attention of the federal government, prompting the EPA to establish an office of Environmental Justice in 1992, and President Clinton to sign an executive order telling agencies to address it in 1994 The results were usually stark. In the 1987 report \u201cToxic Waste and Race in the U.S.,\u201d researchers found that race was the best predictor of where toxic waste sites would be found in the U.S. https://t.co/peP9fvEXZh Lots of research asked the basic question: Are communities of color disproportionately exposed to toxic conditions and environmental risks?

You can listen to the episode here: https://t.co/hZTqCyVpBq #OverheardNatGeo The circus remains closed indefinitely. The troupe lives in containers on a small plot of land in Guatemala City, and will once again take their talents onto the streets until they've earned enough to buy back everything Alejandro sold in Honduras. https://t.co/nqvXwg7yHj They made it with just a week to spare before his business license expired. That same day, his wife gave birth to a daughter, Aleangela, or, as he calls her, \u201cthe newest star of the Segovia Brothers Circus.\u201d Alejandro crossed into Guatemala in late July with his wife and four daughters. A few days later, he dropped his wife off at the hospital and drove to the border to greet his circus. Enter an unlikely savior: Guatemala\u2019s President Alejandro Giammattei, who got word of their predicament and in a surprise FaceTime call, offered Alejandro fuel vouchers to travel to the Guatemala border. Traveling circuses are wildly popular in Central America as a reprieve from the stresses of  unemployment, social inequality, and political instability. People donated food and money to keep them afloat\u2014but it wasn\u2019t enough to get them out of Honduras. https://t.co/gxQtXAvxOX Alejandro began to sell off the circus. The performers took their acts to the streets, soliciting money and donations. https://t.co/BOUJRgt9Ck For many, it was the longest they had stayed in one place in years. As Lilian\u2019s mom, Telma says: \u201cI believe there is such a thing as circus blood. You have to be indomitable; you have to yearn for liberty. And that\u2019s what the circus is: liberty.\u201d For four months, the troupe waited in Honduras, unable to perform. The circus performers refer to non-circus folk as \u201cstay-at-home\u201d people. Suddenly they, too, were stay-at-home people. https://t.co/DYLTUayncV There were two pressing deadlines in July: Alejandro\u2019s business license would expire and his wife, Vany L\u00f3pez, was due to give birth. If the baby was born outside of Guatemala, it wouldn\u2019t have citizenship and might not be allowed to enter the country. Unable to draw crowds, cut off from investment, and running out of food, they didn\u2019t know if they would ever get home to Guatemala\u2014or how they would survive in Honduras. https://t.co/aGMK6xVXVQ But earlier this year, Alejandro, Lilian, and the 35-person troupe arrived to Honduras on an international tour right before the country went into lockdown. They were trapped. His niece, Lilian Segovia, has never known life outside the circus. \u201cThe normal and mundane never called to me,\u201d she says. She worked hard to earn her place as a hula hoop dancer, honing her strength for what she really wants: a strongman act. https://t.co/DP3dcRxg7k Alejandro Segovia\u2019s family started Guatemala\u2019s first modern circus in 1884. Growing up, Alejandro trained as an acrobat, a stunt motorcycle rider, a magician. But there was one thing he\u2019d never tackled: a global pandemic. Honduran photographer Tomas Ayuso (@tayuso) was driving through Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, this summer when he spotted a circus troupe performing at a busy intersection. He pulled over to find out what was happening. https://t.co/PKRgDE4ciV Hi! I\u2019m Nina Strochlic (@ninastrochlic), a Nat Geo staff writer.

Huge thanks to Ricardo and @DoctorGladys for sharing their knowledge and passion this #WildlifeConservationDay https://t.co/YIk1neFvXj Always be humble and know how to listen, since there are many people who can contribute a lot to projects and our lives. The best of all is to dream and seek to realize those dreams. Study a degree that you really like and try to opt for a master's and a doctorate of science. Reading many scientific articles, you should also learn about the ecology and natural history of the other species that share the habitat and of the forest. Ricardo: If someone wants to work with wildlife and with felines in particular, these would be my advice: first you must have a passion for what you want to do, true wildlife conservation is not easy, but it is not impossible. https://t.co/sGx6JswyOI Also, know that each and every one of us can make a difference \u2013 even if you start small. @DoctorGladys: Stay focused and Never give up! Conservation work takes dedication, passion and hard work \u2013 but the rewards, knowing that you are making a difference and protecting wildlife and the environment for future generations - are well worth the effort. https://t.co/RtSUf4v99i QUESTION 6: What advice would you give to someone who wants to do what you do? You have to follow your dreams and my dream is to keep seeing the tracks of the jaguar and hear its roar that gives him away. Ricardo: You can support in different ways, helping as volunteers in field work (at this time with all health security measures), in the dissemination of information about what @yaguarapanama does, and also making donations to continue amplifying the voice of the jaguar. There is a huge potential for positive global change if every one of us just does a little bit. You can also buy products which make a positive conservation difference \u2013 such as @GCCoffee1, our \u2018coffee with a cause\u2019, which is available internationally in USA, UK, Kenya and NZ You can also spread awareness about conservation efforts around the world, and give donations which are urgently needed right now to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on endangered species and their habitats. @DoctorGladys: Do whatever you can and give whatever you can manage \u2013 every little bit makes a difference. And try to make sure your actions make a positive, not a negative, impact on the world \u2013 reduce plastic use, recycle, avoid wild animal products, reduce red meat consumption QUESTION 5: What's the number one thing an average person can do to help aid conservation efforts like these? All the species that exist in the world contribute to the fact that we humans can minimally breathe and drink water to live. This means that if we continue in a post-pandemic world, we should already be prepared to know what is important, and that is to take care of the planet. Ricardo: I sincerely hope that all humans who live on earth understand how important it is to take care of our house, which is the planet earth, the only house we have. We will continue with the pandemic for a longer time, and I hope there will be a lot of positive reflection. I see local communities also being able to sell their crafts through the internet (for example https://t.co/NLIQSmR52g). Gorilla Conservation Coffee \u2018s first distributor in the US also buys crafts from Northern Rangeland Trust in Kenya. People can still support the gorillas by buying a bag of  coffee even if they are not able to visit which has already been happening during the pandemic. We are also finding new ways to support conservation, such as our Gorilla Conservation Coffee which supports livelihoods for community members on the outskirts of Bwindi and a donation from each bag is given back to conservation and community projects #savinggorillasonesipatatime Given people\u2019s passion for conservation, I could see more people engaging in remote activities such as virtual gorilla tracking, livestreams of night cameras or waterhole monitoring, wildlife documentaries and similar activities as we wait for things to normalize. Conservation efforts will also have to rely on non tourism sources of funding to sustain activities. However, we're thankful that people all over the world are committed to ensuring the protection of our environment and wildlife and are humbled by the donations we've received. This will have \u2013 and is already having \u2013 a huge impact on conservation as much of the revenue for conservation comes from tourism. In Uganda, for example, tourism and travel provides about 700,000 jobs and contributes 7.7% of GDP to the Ugandan economy. @DoctorGladys: It may take years for tourism in Uganda and the rest of Africa to resume to pre-COVID-19 levels as many people have been affected by the economic shocks resulting from the pandemic, and people will need time to regain confidence in travel. QUESTION 4: How do you expect conservation efforts to change\u2014if at all\u2014in a post-pandemic world? We also reinforced a jaguar (wildlife) and human conflict attention group that works from the calls that people make to Yaguar\u00e1 Panama / Ministry of the Environment when there are cases of predation on farms, road kill animals, for example. The positive aspects have been that technology has helped us to be able to give many talks / webinar to many people in Panama and internationally, and to have access to a greater number of people than we think. At this moment I am not sure if there is more or less hunting in the protected areas, it is very difficult to quantify this at the moment. Ricardo: Negative in some aspects and positive in others. Negative because it was impossible to continue the projects and visit the communities due to the total closure caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Panama. However, this has resulted in great ape viewing guidelines being upgraded to minimize the risk of disease transmission of not only COVID-19, but other infectious  zoonotic diseases from people to gorillas,  chimpanzees  and orangutans,  as well as other primates We are working hard to train all people who come into contact with, or live in proximity to, the gorillas, particularly habituated gorillas who are no longer naturally wary of humans, on COVID-19 prevention measures. Mountain Gorilla survival is also threatened by the risk of #COVID19 transmission as they are genetically so similar to us. A COVID-19 outbreak amongst the gorillas could have dire consequences for the survival of the species. Poaching and hunting has increased with rising poverty and desperation, particularly around protected areas like Bwindi Impenetrable National Park where much of our work takes place as tourism, on which many people depended for income and jobs completely crashed. @DoctorGladys: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it two major risks for endangered Mountain Gorillas. QUESTION 3: Has the #COVID19 pandemic been positive or negative for the conservation efforts focused on these species? This is followed by loss of habitat; the advance of the livestock and agricultural frontier; misinformation, illegal trafficking, as well as an emerging underground market for the sale of parts for their supposed use in traditional Asian medicine. Ricardo: The main threats to jaguars in Panama are conflict between humans, and for revenge they kill the cats Of particular concern for Mountain Gorillas is the risk of zoonotic diseases transmission as they share over 98% of DNA with humans which makes them susceptible to the same diseases that affect humans. @DoctorGladys: Mountain Gorillas are threatened by habitat loss, disease, poaching and conflict with humans. This is made worse by the living conditions of people surrounding gorilla habitats like poverty, lack of health and other social services and high human population growth Question 2: What are the primary threats to the species in your area of study? Our work deals with changing people's attitudes and perceptions about wild cats through scientific information, use of technology, education and working with local communities to improve the coexistence between human beings and wildlife. I'm in Panama. Ricardo: I'm from the Yaguar\u00e1 Panama Foundation and a National Geographic Explorer.

This is made worse by the living conditions of people surrounding gorilla habitats like poverty, lack of health and other social services and high human population growth", "Question 2: What are the primary threats to the species in your area of study?", "Our work deals with changing people's attitudes and perceptions about wild cats through scientific information, use of technology, education and working with local communities to improve the coexistence between human beings and wildlife.
