Always be present. https://t.co/6ipU4a4gY5 @shanemcanally What do you find inspiring about #TheVoice? (2/2) Don\u2019t do it because you need affirmation or praise. Praise is fleeting.

Stay healthy y\u2019all!!  #IDareYouQuestions To everyone asking album related questions, there is one we are working on now to follow up this project with. We have a little studio set up here in Montana and I will be finishing the album here it looks like ha! https://t.co/lViCC4CIA8 I have an incredibly gifted team this season and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one of them took the win this year! https://t.co/zbc0zswGLG I love all languages. That\u2019s not a politically correct answer I\u2019m feeding you either. I genuinely love something about every language. They\u2019re all unique and maybe it\u2019s because my love of music but the actual sound of each language is so specific and drenched in culture. https://t.co/aEmspPfMCx In therapy \ud83d\ude02 I check in quite a bit with myself as well because I\u2019m almost forced to with how busy I am and I can get very unhealthy emotionally if I\u2019m not constantly checking in with myself and evaluating my decisions/goals/reality https://t.co/yWm2B7INJY My hope is to get to perform with all of them one day in person! That was the goal before all of this craziness happened. https://t.co/KlSX4NiNiQ Happy Birthday and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re getting a pandemic, stay 6ft away from each other celebration \ud83d\ude2c https://t.co/mYcHlzfzuu Spanish was easiest for me but that\u2019s because I at least grew up with a bit of knowledge of that language. Plenty of people in the state of Texas speak English and Spanish. https://t.co/RLde4F7VHp I asked to do these specific languages. I wanted to do more but we were running out of time and decided to focus on nailing these 5 languages first. I would still record other languages with artists from other countries! The more global connection, the better! https://t.co/s82tFVrKqA Most of them haha! Hebrew and Arabic were honestly the most fun to record because they were the most challenging for me as I had never in my life said one word in either language let alone be singing in them. https://t.co/XNz3XPYc04 I just joined the peloton world and am currently switching front the bike to a treadmill, and then sometimes I do some Tracy Anderson videos online. I have to try and stay as active as possible or else emotionally I can tend to crumble in an isolating environment \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f https://t.co/0SzNc5sbgM I grew up singing in different languages so I have always wanted to incorporate that into a project and haven\u2019t had the right song/team to implement this idea until now. I have always been captivated by languages. https://t.co/2wVqhiBHjS I listened to them sing it. I looked up every single word online to ensure I was hopefully nailing it because dialects come into play as well. Once I knew what the words sounded like I then phonetically spelled them out so I could sing faster moments with a bit more ease. https://t.co/TjHw1B38Ds Yes I am. I shot a little video from Montana for it, so expectations of production should be low ha! https://t.co/34cqbqQIql Ok y\u2019all, I\u2019m ready to answer your questions!
