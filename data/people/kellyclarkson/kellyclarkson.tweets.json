Micah, and every artist, needs to sing like it\u2019s their final performance each time they sing or else you\u2019re doing yourself, and your fans, a disservice. Never call it in. Always be present. https://t.co/6ipU4a4gY5 @shanemcanally What do you find inspiring about #TheVoice? (2/2) Don\u2019t do it because you need affirmation or praise. Praise is fleeting. Confidence and love of your purpose is everything. https://t.co/MaUiPNmTag (1/2) Probably \u201cYou Can\u2019t Win\u201d oddly enough ha!

Any place in particular that sparks creativity for you? @shanemcanally How has it been working with an artist who you\u2019ve only worked with though teleconferencing? @ShaneMcAnally Life inspires me to write. I\u2019m not one of those people that can plan to write on a certain day. I need a reason to get my emotions/thoughts out of me and, for me, that has to be right when I need to get them out. https://t.co/QSHzz28JRk Hey y\u2019all!

Stay healthy y\u2019all!!  #IDareYouQuestions To everyone asking album related questions, there is one we are working on now to follow up this project with. We have a little studio set up here in Montana and I will be finishing the album here it looks like ha! https://t.co/lViCC4CIA8 I have an incredibly gifted team this season and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one of them took the win this year! https://t.co/zbc0zswGLG I love all languages. That\u2019s not a politically correct answer I\u2019m feeding you either. I genuinely love something about every language. They\u2019re all unique and maybe it\u2019s because my love of music but the actual sound of each language is so specific and drenched in culture. https://t.co/aEmspPfMCx In therapy \ud83d\ude02 I check in quite a bit with myself as well because I\u2019m almost forced to with how busy I am and I can get very unhealthy emotionally if I\u2019m not constantly checking in with myself and evaluating my decisions/goals/reality https://t.co/yWm2B7INJY My hope is to get to perform with all of them one day in person! That was the goal before all of this craziness happened. https://t.co/KlSX4NiNiQ Happy Birthday and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re getting a pandemic, stay 6ft away from each other celebration \ud83d\ude2c https://t.co/mYcHlzfzuu Spanish was easiest for me but that\u2019s because I at least grew up with a bit of knowledge of that language. Plenty of people in the state of Texas speak English and Spanish. https://t.co/RLde4F7VHp I asked to do these specific languages. I wanted to do more but we were running out of time and decided to focus on nailing these 5 languages first. I would still record other languages with artists from other countries! The more global connection, the better! https://t.co/s82tFVrKqA Most of them haha! Hebrew and Arabic were honestly the most fun to record because they were the most challenging for me as I had never in my life said one word in either language let alone be singing in them. https://t.co/XNz3XPYc04 I just joined the peloton world and am currently switching front the bike to a treadmill, and then sometimes I do some Tracy Anderson videos online. I have to try and stay as active as possible or else emotionally I can tend to crumble in an isolating environment \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f https://t.co/0SzNc5sbgM I grew up singing in different languages so I have always wanted to incorporate that into a project and haven\u2019t had the right song/team to implement this idea until now. I have always been captivated by languages. https://t.co/2wVqhiBHjS I listened to them sing it. I looked up every single word online to ensure I was hopefully nailing it because dialects come into play as well. Once I knew what the words sounded like I then phonetically spelled them out so I could sing faster moments with a bit more ease. https://t.co/TjHw1B38Ds Yes I am. I shot a little video from Montana for it, so expectations of production should be low ha! https://t.co/34cqbqQIql Ok y\u2019all, I\u2019m ready to answer your questions!

I never want anyone to feel left out and I always want to make everyone feel special. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife I think we all give love how we want to receive it.

Steven Tyler, Alanis Morissette, and The Toadies taught me how to let go of perfection and really truly emote. #gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife I have always been passionate about music in a variety of genres.\n#gno #mom2summit #MeaningOfLife RT @MomItForward: Q3: @KELLY_CLARKSON\u2019S \u201cMEANING OF LIFE\u201d ALBUM FEATURES A VARIETY OF MUSIC GENRES FROM R&amp;B &amp; SOUL TO POP &amp; MORE.

Behind the scenes of the very 1st recording session for my album, #WrappedInRed! https://t.co/mPTVH0p3cu @alishamarie1993 me too! @SkatingOnARiver is it weird that I have the same mug?? :) @TNVOLINFL who doesn't?? Thank y'all so much for hangin' &amp; listening to #wrappedinred with me :) Merry Christmas!! The acapella part at the end will always be my favorite. #silentnight Not gonna lie. I listen 2 this all year long. Doesn't matter if it's June. I sang with @reba &amp; @trishayearwood #whoami :) #silentnight Favorite part is the last \"please\" because I got so emotional it almost didn't come out. #ilovesadthingssometimes #justfornow If you haven't heard @imogenheap original version please listen. Her voice is so beautiful &amp; honest, like crystal! #justfornow .@imogenheap wrote such an honest song with this one. Not everybody wants to hear the truth but I love singing it. #justfornow I wish y'all could have been in my brain movie while I was recording this. I had a whole scene playing out ha! #4carats I wanted a fun, material girl kinda song for this album. Obviously this isn't what xmas is about but it's fun to pretend. #4carats People just don't play like this anymore! What an amazing job the band/orchestra did?! #myfavoritethings This is one of my favorites on the album but it's still no Julie Andrews. #original #myfavoritethings I've always loved this song but I wanted to do something different with it. Hope y'all like it! #myfavoritethings .@gregkurstin plays the &amp;#@! out of this piano solo! So talented!! #WhiteChristmas There's nothing better than a classic Christmas song like White Christmas. :) I LOVE the last chorus, right after the broken down section! #winterdreams This song is a mix of quirky love &amp; my love for old school movie musicals. #winterdreams I can totally see us older &amp; sitting on a porch in rocking chairs still singing this 2 my hubby :) @BBlackstock #winterdreams If anyone tries to get you to stay like this... Run! They definitely might kill you or be slipping something into your drink haha :) @dontouchmyidols nope. All the ones I wrote made it to this album. I had a lot of fun writing Christmas songs. What a creepy yet awesome duet ha?!  #BabyItsColdOutside Getting to sing with @ronniedunn was on my bucket list so check that off! He's so soulful! #babyitscoldoutside @sharon457 tweet :) @heyychelsayy haha yes! I had so much fun with @jasonhalbert recording different tones vocally to make it sound like a big gospel choir! It's hard not to think of Elvis every time you hear this song. I bet you were already thinking about it ....yeah you were :) #BlueChristmas @nicoleb21x we actually didn't record it that way @ 1st but then we did it acapella 4 a video teaser &amp; realized we had to change the ending. The musicians on this song kill me every time I hear it! So tasteful! So talented! #BlueChristmas Once again, background vocals are my favorite part. #EveryChristmas @VictoriaLFisher thanks!! Wrote this w/ my guitarist @abeneubanks &amp; it was amazing 2 see it grow from a simple piano/vocal 2 what it is now. #EveryChristmas @mpulley2010 yeah! That's what I'm talking about! Random little fact: My duet partner @benhaenow sang this on his season of X Factor. 1 of my fav Xmas songs!  #PleaseComeHomeForChristmas @KCsoothesmysoul haha coal trouble is the worst! Give me a mic &amp; a big, bluesy ballad &amp; I'm in heaven! #PleaseComeHomeForChristmas @keatonrjones how cold you look is the main reason why I've never been to Chicago for Christmas :) A little blues &amp; a little rock n roll never hurt anyone! That's all I'm sayin. #RunRunRudolph This is my FAVORITE song off of this album to perform live! It is so much fun to sing! #RunRunRudolph I wanted to sing this as is to honor its classic feel but I had to throw a little KC in there around 2:52 :) The orchestra is insane! Wow! They're so effortless &amp; beautiful :) #HaveYourselfAMerryLittleChristmas The saxophone solo &amp; the background vocals are my favorite parts of this song. #underneaththetree I always feel like shopping when I hear this song ha! #underneaththetree I still can't believe how fast this song came together with @gregkurstin. It was an amazing writing experience! #underneaththetree Nothing cooler than writing a song you love with people you love more! @shanemcanally @ashleyarrison @abeneubanks #wrappedinred I wrote this song based on a personal experience &amp; one of my favorite movies \"Love Actually.\u201d #wrappedinred Cue up your albums and let's do this! @vicrob222 haha I meant to type \"vocal\" not \"coal\" @vicrob222 me too! Haven't had coal trouble in years. It figures it would happen on my favorite tour ha @ismetkaramanKC ugh I'd probably cry. It's so sad &amp; I'm so pregnant &amp; hormonal haha @vicrob222 thank you! I am a total nerd over any and all Christmas music :) @saltire123 @GameOfThrones I LOVE Scotland &amp; we thought we'd bring some of our ancestry to one of our favorite shows :) @lovetherisk play the red vinyl :) @lovetherisk hell yes!!
