The Bill browns should stop it!! https://t.co/8a7MbGcszs @anandvasu True and public shaming will ensure a bowler will never dare to run the batter out. @varun_vaithy We can agree to disagree.

While I'm 100% onboard with running out a batsman if they st\u2026 @varun_vaithy Instead of Disallowing the run, may be the bowler can get a free ball the very next one where the batsmen has backed up. Some fairness to start off may be. @varun_vaithy If and not of. @varun_vaithy Can\u2019t we agree the batter is out, of a bowler steps out and gets a batsmen out while the umpire has missed calling it a no ball. After all the bowler was willing to take a risk!! The difference in the game is getting broadened because tech is being used against the bowler mostly. It is time to restore the balance in what is an increasingly tough environement for the bowlers. #thefrontcrease #belongs to #bothparties @bhogleharsha we can use the same tech that we are proposing for a no ball check 120 balls in a T 20 game. Putting the same batsmen on strike might cost me a 4 or a 6 from the next ball and eventually cost me 7 more runs instead of may be a 1 and a dot ball possibility at a different batsmen. The same will mean massively for a batter wanting to get off strike even in a test match. Many of you will not be able to see the grave disaparity here, so let me take some time out to clarify to the best of my abilities. If the non striker backs up 2 feet and manages to come back for a 2, he will put the same batsmen on strike for the next ball. Just hope that technology will see if a batsmen is backing up before the bowler bowls a ball and disallow the runs of that ball every time the batter does so!!Thus, parity will be restored as far as the front line is concerned. #noball #dontbackup @RK_sports Thanks RK Happy to announce, I will be hosting the first ever cricket quiz in Tamil on @starsportstamil\nhttps://t.co/zDtvIRYQ8v website la poi register panunga enkooda interact panra vaipa perunga.\n\nEnna Knowledgeable Tamil cricket Rasigargale, Aattathukku Ready-ah? #aattathukkureadyah https://t.co/FziRDMLjzH \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd2a https://t.co/mjZtLeVQPl https://t.co/JnfcXe9lPt @s_badrinath @IrfanPathan @ImRaina Venugopal Rao? @s_badrinath Mahela Jayawardene!!?

The prime ministers role is not as exhaustive as the others but a great character indeed @sridhair1990 I agree. Tamil is a beautiful language, those who can\u2019t read it in Tamil, will still feel satiated with English translation. It\u2019s \u201cThe Chozha dynasty \u201c that stands tall . @VjAniruddh I read it in English, but Tamil is box office ( as told by a friend ) @deepbasra I wish there were, a movie would be an injustice to this novel. To narrate it in 3 hours will be tragic. Note: there are so many characters in this story, so don\u2019t try nd dwell deep into them as you start the book. Take it through and read, the characters will grow on you. The names will feel unique nd different, but they will make you feel like you should name your kids after them. @mrangam Vandiyathevan, Arul Mozhi and Nandini. Special mention to Azhwarkidayen @RamkumarVenka12 Cv karthik Narayanan @somnathweets Yes same name. When the lockdown began, I started to read Ponniyin Selvan, I am almost done with it now and feel like I will miss these characters once the book comes to end. Those who love reading novels, please don\u2019t miss out on this one, it\u2019s available in english too. #mindblowing Salute \ud83d\ude4f the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for our country.

Positive outlook is the basis of life moving forward\ud83e\udd29 @Kprs21 @harbhajan_singh @JacobWadsworth6 Look forward to playing cricket for sure.. getting edgy for sure but it\u2019s important that humanity lives to fight another day as of now.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb @Vijayal20676054 We don\u2019t give enough importance to stress and anxiety, which is very important to get back on our feet whenever this clears up.
