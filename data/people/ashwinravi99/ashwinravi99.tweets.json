The Bill browns should stop it!! https://t.co/8a7MbGcszs @anandvasu True and public shaming will ensure a bowler will never dare to run the batter out. @varun_vaithy We can agree to disagree.

While I'm 100% onboard with running out a batsman if they st\u2026 @varun_vaithy Instead of Disallowing the run, may be the bowler can get a free ball the very next one where the batsmen has backed up. Some fairness to start off may be. @varun_vaithy If and not of. @varun_vaithy Can\u2019t we agree the batter is out, of a bowler steps out and gets a batsmen out while the umpire has missed calling it a no ball. After all the bowler was willing to take a risk!! The difference in the game is getting broadened because tech is being used against the bowler mostly. It is time to restore the balance in what is an increasingly tough environement for the bowlers. #thefrontcrease #belongs to #bothparties @bhogleharsha we can use the same tech that we are proposing for a no ball check 120 balls in a T 20 game. Putting the same batsmen on strike might cost me a 4 or a 6 from the next ball and eventually cost me 7 more runs instead of may be a 1 and a dot ball possibility at a different batsmen. The same will mean massively for a batter wanting to get off strike even in a test match. Many of you will not be able to see the grave disaparity here, so let me take some time out to clarify to the best of my abilities. If the non striker backs up 2 feet and manages to come back for a 2, he will put the same batsmen on strike for the next ball. Just hope that technology will see if a batsmen is backing up before the bowler bowls a ball and disallow the runs of that ball every time the batter does so!!Thus, parity will be restored as far as the front line is concerned. #noball #dontbackup @RK_sports Thanks RK Happy to announce, I will be hosting the first ever cricket quiz in Tamil on @starsportstamil\nhttps://t.co/zDtvIRYQ8v website la poi register panunga enkooda interact panra vaipa perunga.\n\nEnna Knowledgeable Tamil cricket Rasigargale, Aattathukku Ready-ah? #aattathukkureadyah https://t.co/FziRDMLjzH \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd2a https://t.co/mjZtLeVQPl https://t.co/JnfcXe9lPt @s_badrinath @IrfanPathan @ImRaina Venugopal Rao? @s_badrinath Mahela Jayawardene!!?

Ob was tough word to accept for me\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 @mrangam Batsmen were never given out lbw if they plonked their foot on the front foot then, can we erase all the runs that were made by batters then?? Not a fair judgement, Saeed Anwar\u2019s batting was a treat to the eye.\ud83e\udd29 @sunsuji17091 Unfortunate ways of reporting have brought us to see a backhand in everything.

Nothing wrong in trying to change things even if it feels difficult to do so. I appreciate your concern though. There are so many tweets talking about people killing themselves on social media, it\u2019s both triggering and horrible. I hope we do so only after posting strong trigger warnings. *hashtags Hopefully we will value lives more than just Hastags, and sincerely hope this is last one of those hashtags we may ever have to use. #JusticeForJeyarajAndFenix Every single life matters. We should make sure that this act of brutality is meted out with justice, and I am not sure justice will be any solace for the family of #JeyarajandFenix  and my thoughts are with them.

A ranji title for TN( a dream for which I am trying to find answers ) @KDasgupta_18 @WasimJaffer14 That\u2019s exactly the reason I have this show. The formula for success is an effort in a bid to learn the success of winning the ranji trophy. It\u2019s celebrating first class cricket. #E2 of #TheFormulaForSuccessWithAsh premiering at 4 pm! It was a delight to listen to @WasimJaffer14 speak. Please watch &amp; let me know how you liked it!\nhttps://t.co/r0yImGLdU5 We visited #theformulaforsuccesswithash featuring @amolmuzumdar11 last week.

This is me interviewing @ashwinravi99 \n\nhttps://t.co/\u2026 @vikramsathaye @amolmuzumdar11 Thanks Vikram!! @mrangam True !! The prime ministers role is not as exhaustive as the others but a great character indeed @sridhair1990 I agree. Tamil is a beautiful language, those who can\u2019t read it in Tamil, will still feel satiated with English translation. It\u2019s \u201cThe Chozha dynasty \u201c that stands tall . @VjAniruddh I read it in English, but Tamil is box office ( as told by a friend ) @deepbasra I wish there were, a movie would be an injustice to this novel. To narrate it in 3 hours will be tragic. Note: there are so many characters in this story, so don\u2019t try nd dwell deep into them as you start the book. Take it through and read, the characters will grow on you. The names will feel unique nd different, but they will make you feel like you should name your kids after them. @mrangam Vandiyathevan, Arul Mozhi and Nandini. Special mention to Azhwarkidayen @RamkumarVenka12 Cv karthik Narayanan @somnathweets Yes same name. When the lockdown began, I started to read Ponniyin Selvan, I am almost done with it now and feel like I will miss these characters once the book comes to end. Those who love reading novels, please don\u2019t miss out on this one, it\u2019s available in english too. #mindblowing Salute \ud83d\ude4f the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for our country.

Let\u2019s hang in to fight and hopefully learn. Over to the states!! What\u2019s up for may 18th and beyond? #COVID19 8 pm tonight we will be glued to the television, as the time ahead is extremely critical and we will need to adapt and evolve.

We will value our work and things outside much more than we ever have @almas_arshad Why not?? But many of them choose to show hatred in questions, I am sure we can move past that @jayeshvk16 Nature is the boss @KarthikeyanS01 Nature has pressed the rewind button. Let\u2019s see if this leads us to more positive outcomes once this blows over @jish_deep Hard work!! Trying to exercise and read books. Watching a lot of tv is actually making me feel even more miserable. @akash_bodla You are both the question and the answer. God bless\ud83d\ude02 @MasssSuriya It will have an impact for sure.. will take time for players to hit the form button @Harmeetsingh83 Do isolation drills. @rt_Kalle @sachin_rt @dks Thank u @CricManas @DelhiCapitals Obviously @rnbintweetmood I am not so sure.

Positive outlook is the basis of life moving forward\ud83e\udd29 @Kprs21 @harbhajan_singh @JacobWadsworth6 Look forward to playing cricket for sure.. getting edgy for sure but it\u2019s important that humanity lives to fight another day as of now.\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb @Vijayal20676054 We don\u2019t give enough importance to stress and anxiety, which is very important to get back on our feet whenever this clears up.
