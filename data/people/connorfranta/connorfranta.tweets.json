The last 4 years of my life have been quietly dedicated to becoming healthy, strong, fulfilled, enlightened and ultimately, the best version of myself im capable of being. And I\u2019m SO proud of the progressive I\u2019ve been able to make. As a person coping with depression, anxiety, and at it\u2019s worst, suicidal thoughts for my entire adult life, I refuse to be brought down by unwarranted outside influences when most days are already an internal fight to keep my head above water.
