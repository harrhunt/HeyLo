And I wish this level of positive self-progression on anybody else who wants it. No shade, only tea. I fucked with myself for far too long to compliantly allow anyone else fuck with me now, okay? If that somehow makes me a villain in your eyes, then \u270c\ud83c\udffbhoney it\u2019s been real. The exit is down the hall and to the right. The last 4 years of my life have been quietly dedicated to becoming healthy, strong, fulfilled, enlightened and ultimately, the best version of myself im capable of being. And I\u2019m SO proud of the progressive I\u2019ve been able to make. As a person coping with depression, anxiety, and at it\u2019s worst, suicidal thoughts for my entire adult life, I refuse to be brought down by unwarranted outside influences when most days are already an internal fight to keep my head above water. My choices have everything to do with me and nothing to do with you. warm bottled wines and general store liquor / i swear that im fine but ive never been sicker Hi Twitter. This is my dad.
