Someone had to say it !!!!! I just love @taylorswift13 for committing to bringing so much magic to a time in which she knows so many of her fans may be suffering. This is the least profitable era of music we\u2019ve lived to see and she\u2019s working very hard because it makes people happy. That\u2019s really somethin\u2019 It\u2019s a video \ud83d\ude33 nightmare food. https://t.co/fiKFhKoxq3 sometimes that video pops into my head and I just....need to pause https://t.co/pFeZVEhV7C I just think about this a lot https://t.co/0nVqQorpxh I agree but also consider: Cedar https://t.co/sM7R7DhOwM I\u2019m keeping 5 secrets. I love my fans because they are kind and supportive and smart and helpful and capable. I have seen the friendships you have nurtured with one another and it is arguably one of the only redeeming things about having this big of a platform. 10/10 would quit without you. I\u2019m just coming and going less frequently than usual! \ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd0d\ud83e\udd0d still here though! https://t.co/0IWukm4vVx \ud83d\ude26 too much is happening today https://t.co/PpVgqQvv3d Ohhhhh man this one hurt https://t.co/F7KUe0hfij Crying real tears ! https://t.co/G5sGbJOOQT I heard it months ago ;) https://t.co/CCJCh1lGwd teresa rights !!!!! @yungblud @visitkingdoms I\u2019m blocking you So excited to announce round 3 of the #BlackCreatorsFund with @CashApp! download the app to donate \ud83e\udd0d https://t.co/lGKUdPkqb2 #partner https://t.co/n8rhyxwz1o sheeeh. Pandemic hit a month after my album came out and I did my damn best. Thank you \ud83d\udc97 https://t.co/I0MO77Lmnb oh I looove this bit too. https://t.co/F5JnOzANF8 yesssss. And a subtle nod to a few other things as well. Like my tattoo, amongst others. https://t.co/iXLh13sYyk Mhmm! Even though this is by far the least decorative or in-depth of them all, it\u2019s one of my favorites actually. Cause it\u2019s about my responsibility as an artist and my relationship with my fans overtaking my desires to cause myself harm or self destruct. The best medicine. \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/PDyrIOLyho yes!!! So originally the \u201cspiderwebs one eye open\u201d blah blah bit was really dark and written about a black eye (hence the manic cover!) and then it sort of evolved when I made manic for YOU all!!! The eye became a positive symbol. https://t.co/Z7Rd2S6wlV hopefully jail! https://t.co/miPDEjngFc Eight \ud83d\ude2c hahahah https://t.co/3dCc8RcJ22 I think it\u2019s all encompassing! I\u2019ve certainly made myself physically smaller and let down people who cared about me to! It\u2019s about changing shape in any form for someone or something else. https://t.co/VPolIQpQMQ Bingo!!!!! https://t.co/q5cDu298ot when I make myself smaller for someone, I let down those who care about me and rely on me to be my big ol\u2019 self. I lose track of what\u2019s important when I focus on lowering myself to soften someone else\u2019s ego \ud83e\udd7a https://t.co/sER96sAhoB It started as the poem! It was just that little stanza and I always thought it was so much more meaningful isolated. \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/YaPOIU3Ayh It was originally! But...We broke up. Hahaha. So the end of the song took on a different meaning and it became dark and anxious into the \u201cWHAT AM I THINKING?! WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?!!!?\u201d Part. The songs change often as my life does! https://t.co/yuMtpuieTY I thought about it. But I really wanted the words to live on their own and I didn\u2019t want it to come across as \u201cscrapbook-y\u201d I love books like that! But it didn\u2019t feel right for me this time. I wanted you guys to be getting a real book and not feel cheated by filler pages https://t.co/O1Sr3s7rHS Haha yes I did!!! \u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f https://t.co/fUkdfuf9tq Lighthouse, The Painter, a lot of the ones about gender identity (cause I\u2019ve never like, talked about that) Eight, and Seventeen I think were some of the toughest. I might be forgetting some though! https://t.co/iiAHRRHZAW Honestly no! Hahah. And to think it was #2 is kind of just insane. Feels very similar to how I felt Badlands release week! Just in awe... https://t.co/h2ziTqolUv I wanted it to read like an advertisement.

Can\u2019t tell who I have a bigger crush on. Anya Taylor-Joy or Thomas Brodie-Sangster !!!! Definite love to the poll workers and poll officials and news personnel who put in the work the past week in an impatient and anxious nation. Hoping they get a long nap today. Celebrate to your heart\u2019s content, but do so with the knowledge that this is a massive step, not a final victory. We aren\u2019t hanging up the phone, we just got another person on the line. RT @AOC: One thing I\u2019ll say: for the last two years, I and progressive candidates have been unseating powerful Dem incumbents supported by\u2026 Can\u2019t wait to see how this human completely changes her tune when Trumpism doesn\u2019t work for her anymore and she needs a new path to getting attention. I\u2019ve seen a lot of gross routes to becoming \u201cfamous\u201d but she surely took one of the least dignified. https://t.co/VGScDuiWi9 There\u2019s more work than ever to be done, but a moment of pause and relief is warranted here for so many Americans who deserve it after so much fear. It\u2019s nice to see a celebration after all these years. RT @BernieSanders: I want to thank progressive grassroots organizations for their extraordinary efforts in helping to make Biden's victory\u2026 Mine is extraaaaaa crispy hahaha https://t.co/USHvSKM27R I suspect my brain matter looks like this right now https://t.co/L7Q8HUhgK4 @vxronicastle @DonsLens This is not the energy. PD is an avid Biden Harris supporter just like you. I think we can afford him the grace of a mis-worded tweet (that he has more than clarified) in a time where everyone is trying to be positive but we are all actually exploding inside ME MF TOO https://t.co/1VNcR3HBzI it\u2019s always a good time to simp for @ChrisCuomo RT @atl_q0: Stacey Abrams played an absolutely ENORMOUS role in Georgia turning blue. She has become one of the biggest civil and voting ri\u2026 No she\u2019s sooooo sweet this isn\u2019t about her lmaaao the audio just couldn\u2019t be more appropriate https://t.co/YZOulFOuQw this is basically all im getting from trump and his supporters rn https://t.co/qm9KFrpYzq https://t.co/JAfuZPwTA0 https://t.co/RhnMbgcENu Ohhh so now we\u2019re cool with calling him an authoritarian? It wasn\u2019t the deployment of tanks and riot teams, the condoning of white supremacy, the denial of state authority, the delegitimization of oppositional media? It was this...? ah yes this is fraud but it\u2019s okay to \u201cgo to the Supreme Court\u201d and demand the rejection of remaining uncounted votes. trump is basically just skewing logic anyway he can at this point. In regards to close but not called states, if he\u2019s up; he says it counts. if he\u2019s down; he says it doesn\u2019t count. he says people voting for Biden are \u201cdisenfranchising\u201d his supporters. now he\u2019s just making noises. And for today\u2019s trick, I\u2019ll be feeling sick because I\u2019m reading too much news so deciding to stay away from news then feeling guilty for being apathetic and anxious about the news that I\u2019m not reading so reading news and getting anxious but feeling better for being informed ! pls I made this video 6 years ago it was supposed to be YA dystopia I didn\u2019t predict the cringe implications it would have under an actual fascist government \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29 https://t.co/EdZMDI9QtV I am anxious.

Sorry again. \u2764\ufe0f I just wanted to say I am truly sorry for posting that buzzfeed quiz. It was really irresponsible of me.

If you wanna think someone is an asshole, go ahead. Lots of people with mental illnesses are great. Lots of them are assholes. Because they are people. With nuanced personalities. But making jokes specifically targeted towards bipolar hurts more than the 1 person ur angry with. you can hate someone\u2019s actions or opinions without contributing to stigma that damages an entire community of sometimes vulnerable people all for a couple of laughs. A lot of people you know probably have bipolar disorder and you aren\u2019t aware of it. Taking this opportunity to make offensive remarks and villify people with mental illnesses is really not the way to go...this is the exact triggering shit that causes people to keep quiet about it No jokes right now. I have dedicated my career to offering education and insight about bipolar disorder and I\u2019m so disturbed by what I\u2019m seeing. Personal opinions about someone aside, a manic episode isnt a joke. If you can\u2019t offer understanding or sympathy, offer your silence. personally, ****y ***d is my least favorite I just released an album 6 months ago !!!!

Some of us want to keep that part alive and make sure our \u201clegacy\u201d continues if we are fortunate enough to have one, and give our fans the art we have made for them. @killingloomboys It is a sad but true reality that most artists have had the conversations with their trusted teams about what to do with their work if something happens to them. I certainly have many times. We create for our fans and want them to have what we have made / are making for them. yes \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/Aj1Gjk0Bns A lip liner; detective https://t.co/1o6nguzD6c @roomforletters Everytime I see ur face on my timeline it\u2019s makes me so happy.

They absolutely need our help right now by means of donations and awareness. I have made a $20,000 donation here: https://t.co/iCmSRKjeKx \n\nFor more info &amp; how to help: https://t.co/XICLpv6G74 https://t.co/vbStEVzBW3 Felt like reposting that thread with more accurate and realistic verbiage. These stats are important for my followers in the US to read. Our nationalism is drilled into us from such a young age that, while I am not blind to our shortcomings, some of it still shocked me. I am aware that the US is in far better shape than the countries we have personally imperialised through history. But in the current climate of this country I felt compelled to share this information. We are not the country we have been led to believe we are in Hollywood movies. The USA is one of the most unequal countries on the planet in terms of wealth distribution, with a huge gap between the rich and poor, and low social security benefits, and lack of universal healthcare. People in this country (and I find many of my international friends) are unaware of statistics and facts such as these. We have done a criminally good job of propagandizing life here. Prioritizing white life, as these issues impact minorities disproportionally. Then there\u2019s the health care crisis. Right now 25% of US citizens are suffering from delays in healthcare because of skyrocketing costs. 30 million US Americans are without health insurance. Although black women make up less than 7% of the US population, they represent about 10% of all missing persons cases. The Black and Missing Foundation estimates the total number of disappeared black women and girls at 64,000 in 2019. Our government has BEEN corrupt. But Trump\u2019s administration has disregarded democratic norms, as loyalists are promoted, Trump pardons allies, domestic spending is redirected over congressional objection, and police use near lethal force on citizens. Nearly 40 percent of non-elderly adults struggle to meet basic needs such as food, health care, housing, and utilities. Just 6 countries rank above the US in rate of homeless population. 1.4 million Americans will spend time in a shelter in a given year. About 200,000 more are unaccounted unsheltered. More than 47 million Americans have filed jobless claims since March. For Black men, the lifetime risk of dying at the hands of police was 1 in 1,000. Black people make up 13% of the population but almost 30% of police shootings. Shootings. Not other deaths included in that statistic, such as... knees... Across the US infant mortality rates were up to 200 percent higher than in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Black babies are affected the most. We have a terrible maternal mortality rate. There are about 37 deaths per 100,000 births in the USA compared to about 9 per 100,000 in the UK and Germany. Black women are 4 times more likely to die during childbirth in the US. 54% of black maternal deaths are preventable. For starters, we are not guaranteed clean drinking water. More than 60 million Americans are exposed to unsafe drinking water every year. The USA generates a tremendous amount of media that propagandizes \u201cThe American Dream.\u201d Here are some statistics about the USA that may surprise some people who defend it as \u201cthe greatest country in the world\u201d: RT @Blklivesmatter: Until today, you could be fired for being LGBTQ in 26 states in America. The Supreme Court has ruled 6-3, not anymore.\u2026 RT @westonpagano: Living in America means calling the police could kill someone and calling an ambulance could bankrupt someone. I am truly sorry if I offended you! Thread gone. Only meant to educate my US followers on how our perception of the US is propagandized. I understand there are countries who are suffering beyond our understanding as a direct result of US imperialism. But Americans don\u2019t realize how bad the statistics stack up here. RT @_isssamo: saying \u201cI love your hair\u201d to every little black girl&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; get into it.

But it\u2019s an experience that always seems to throw me off balance and make my brain go ????? and I just felt like tweeting about it. When heterosexuality is socially perceived as a \u201cdefault\u201d, you find yourself correcting people and reminding those who have still internalized this \u201cdefault\u201d. Crazy how you think you just \u201ccome out\u201d and then that\u2019s it. It\u2019s done. You\u2019re out + everything is all good. When in actuality you\u2019re coming out time and time again for your whole life. I remind others of this often when they come to me for advice. but it\u2019s easy to forget, myself. @conangray I can\u2019t help it \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I don\u2019t even know what I look like anymore happy 22nd bday to the best guy I\u2019ve ever known.

I wish I had someone like her to look up to when I was growing up. she\u2019s unstoppable. Going back to bed. Again, love you! deleting and ignoring all negativity. BTS deserved many nominations. I am however, unsurprised that they weren\u2019t acknowledged. the US is so far behind on the whole movement. the time will come. CHERRY! EASY! https://t.co/efq1Z50Ejl I love you guys too! https://t.co/8MP980sDoT congrats to the nominees. so much great music nominated this year. definitely see a lot of my friends and colleagues missing from the nom lists, but the music speaks! this is how it goes every year right? my fans \ud83d\udc95 please do not waste your anger or frustration. i see a lot of you are upset. of course im sad too. none of it matters. literally none of it. you\u2019re here. im here. + everything is gonna stay exactly the same and without me is still a super tight, record breaking song \ud83c\udf1f well good morning. I love you. \ud83d\udc97 i bought this hat on amazon and i didn\u2019t realize it wasn\u2019t for grown ups. https://t.co/ByglS08rPR pregnancy is a super sensitive subject. some celebrities are open about having any struggles with reproductive health. some are not. either way it seems really inappropriate to target someone and speculate about something so precious and personal. Is it a boy? Is it a girl? It\u2019s pancakes. Still not pregnant. Still just allergic to gluten. Still love pancakes. \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97 @madeon \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97 yes. https://t.co/DDzoH7S0e4 Joint account !!!!!! https://t.co/UTXuAgL0D9 want to quit music and join anime twitter full time Cute thing bc I need to tweet something cute. My dog will be in the other side of the house minding his own business. n then as soon as I shut my bedroom door he comes RUNNING and whining like \u201cARE YOU SERIOUS? UR GONNA SHUT THE DOOR WHEN I DIDNT EVEN WANNA COME IN THERE ANYWAY?\u201d That\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna say on that for now. You shouldn\u2019t have to live in fear of protecting yourself from the people who are supposed to be on your side. And most young, wide eyed artists, don\u2019t have the foresight to think they will need to. And it\u2019s sad they would ever need to.. artist trust labels. It\u2019s supposed to be a healthy symbiosis. You have holidays with these people. dinners. deaths. Watch babies be born. They watch your lowest lows and highest highs. Sometimes things are unspoken. Legal doesn\u2019t mean moral or ethical. Ps. My first radio play, charting records, and extended play were all seen independent as well before I found a home at my label. I know both sides of this very well. https://t.co/EKeG2G6Q2A Hey man. Good for you. But you don\u2019t become Taylor Swift that way. It takes an army. Everyone wants a different career and a different path, 100% But insinuating she should have known or done better to reach her magnitude is negligent. https://t.co/2viXU8NRGu @jennarosee I\u2019m telling her to stop making it seem like Taylor put herself in this position and could have known / done better ??? It\u2019s negligent ??????? road to manic, episode 2.\n\nhttps://t.co/8dl6uL3O4i I think I died @Pink \ud83d\udc6f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udda4\ud83d\udcf7: @yasi https://t.co/3156Fg2bNV Y\u2019allsey....I\u2019m- https://t.co/sp49z3o8Xj \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97 https://t.co/fhmJbpYJ2j thank u i did it ma self!!!! https://t.co/oaoAmlEdmc see you guys tonight on the @CountryMusic awards https://t.co/AEtpdCW43Z Harry Styles on tour during my birthday? yep!

No 2 songs on the album are alike! https://t.co/yIZmgObVNe Not necessarily. In a weird way it is. It gets very grand and delusional and colorful at times. And then some times it\u2019s very *tiny voice* and straight up. It\u2019s called MANIC!!! Haha https://t.co/Jhxy5GYfYS my friends and I think so. it\u2019s just a different thing. it\u2019s sooooooo real. https://t.co/nhi0jWvnHE badlands hit different at this age.
