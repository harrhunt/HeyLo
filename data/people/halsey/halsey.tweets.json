I can\u2019t stop watching this this is my new favorite tv show https://t.co/66Nbv43PeB keep seeing hummingbirds what does this mean Sincerely, Human Being with a Decade Long Bipolar Diagnosis. If you wanna think someone is an asshole, go ahead. Lots of people with mental illnesses are great. Lots of them are assholes. Because they are people. With nuanced personalities. But making jokes specifically targeted towards bipolar hurts more than the 1 person ur angry with. you can hate someone\u2019s actions or opinions without contributing to stigma that damages an entire community of sometimes vulnerable people all for a couple of laughs. A lot of people you know probably have bipolar disorder and you aren\u2019t aware of it. Taking this opportunity to make offensive remarks and villify people with mental illnesses is really not the way to go...this is the exact triggering shit that causes people to keep quiet about it No jokes right now. I have dedicated my career to offering education and insight about bipolar disorder and I\u2019m so disturbed by what I\u2019m seeing. Personal opinions about someone aside, a manic episode isnt a joke. If you can\u2019t offer understanding or sympathy, offer your silence. personally, ****y ***d is my least favorite I just released an album 6 months ago !!!!

Some of us want to keep that part alive and make sure our \u201clegacy\u201d continues if we are fortunate enough to have one, and give our fans the art we have made for them. @killingloomboys It is a sad but true reality that most artists have had the conversations with their trusted teams about what to do with their work if something happens to them. I certainly have many times. We create for our fans and want them to have what we have made / are making for them. yes \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/Aj1Gjk0Bns A lip liner; detective https://t.co/1o6nguzD6c @roomforletters Everytime I see ur face on my timeline it\u2019s makes me so happy.

These stats are important for my followers in the US to read. Our nationalism is drilled into us from such a young age that, while I am not blind to our shortcomings, some of it still shocked me. I am aware that the US is in far better shape than the countries we have personally imperialised through history. But in the current climate of this country I felt compelled to share this information. We are not the country we have been led to believe we are in Hollywood movies. The USA is one of the most unequal countries on the planet in terms of wealth distribution, with a huge gap between the rich and poor, and low social security benefits, and lack of universal healthcare. People in this country (and I find many of my international friends) are unaware of statistics and facts such as these. We have done a criminally good job of propagandizing life here. Prioritizing white life, as these issues impact minorities disproportionally. Then there\u2019s the health care crisis. Right now 25% of US citizens are suffering from delays in healthcare because of skyrocketing costs. 30 million US Americans are without health insurance. Although black women make up less than 7% of the US population, they represent about 10% of all missing persons cases. The Black and Missing Foundation estimates the total number of disappeared black women and girls at 64,000 in 2019. Our government has BEEN corrupt. But Trump\u2019s administration has disregarded democratic norms, as loyalists are promoted, Trump pardons allies, domestic spending is redirected over congressional objection, and police use near lethal force on citizens. Nearly 40 percent of non-elderly adults struggle to meet basic needs such as food, health care, housing, and utilities. Just 6 countries rank above the US in rate of homeless population. 1.4 million Americans will spend time in a shelter in a given year. About 200,000 more are unaccounted unsheltered. More than 47 million Americans have filed jobless claims since March. For Black men, the lifetime risk of dying at the hands of police was 1 in 1,000. Black people make up 13% of the population but almost 30% of police shootings. Shootings. Not other deaths included in that statistic, such as... knees... Across the US infant mortality rates were up to 200 percent higher than in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Black babies are affected the most. We have a terrible maternal mortality rate. There are about 37 deaths per 100,000 births in the USA compared to about 9 per 100,000 in the UK and Germany. Black women are 4 times more likely to die during childbirth in the US. 54% of black maternal deaths are preventable. For starters, we are not guaranteed clean drinking water. More than 60 million Americans are exposed to unsafe drinking water every year. The USA generates a tremendous amount of media that propagandizes \u201cThe American Dream.\u201d Here are some statistics about the USA that may surprise some people who defend it as \u201cthe greatest country in the world\u201d: RT @Blklivesmatter: Until today, you could be fired for being LGBTQ in 26 states in America. The Supreme Court has ruled 6-3, not anymore.\u2026 RT @westonpagano: Living in America means calling the police could kill someone and calling an ambulance could bankrupt someone. I am truly sorry if I offended you! Thread gone. Only meant to educate my US followers on how our perception of the US is propagandized. I understand there are countries who are suffering beyond our understanding as a direct result of US imperialism. But Americans don\u2019t realize how bad the statistics stack up here.

When in actuality you\u2019re coming out time and time again for your whole life. I remind others of this often when they come to me for advice. but it\u2019s easy to forget, myself. @conangray I can\u2019t help it \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I don\u2019t even know what I look like anymore happy 22nd bday to the best guy I\u2019ve ever known.

Halves of a whole. so when Manic is out, pls don\u2019t skip ur excited asses to a random song. Just at least not on the first listen \ud83d\ude05 Manic will be available starting 12am Midnight locally, January 17th\n\nthe back cover is one of my favorite parts of the album packages. @garretthilliker put his heart into this and it really shows.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to meet you all, again. https://t.co/uYL25WQKrc @blackprints Bb u are ALWAYS welcome with us. you\u2019re a brilliant artist!!!

Is it a boy? Is it a girl? It\u2019s pancakes. Still not pregnant. Still just allergic to gluten.

UR GONNA SHUT THE DOOR WHEN I DIDNT EVEN WANNA COME IN THERE ANYWAY?\u201d That\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna say on that for now. You shouldn\u2019t have to live in fear of protecting yourself from the people who are supposed to be on your side. And most young, wide eyed artists, don\u2019t have the foresight to think they will need to. And it\u2019s sad they would ever need to.. artist trust labels. It\u2019s supposed to be a healthy symbiosis. You have holidays with these people. dinners. deaths. Watch babies be born. They watch your lowest lows and highest highs. Sometimes things are unspoken. Legal doesn\u2019t mean moral or ethical. Ps. My first radio play, charting records, and extended play were all seen independent as well before I found a home at my label. I know both sides of this very well. https://t.co/EKeG2G6Q2A Hey man. Good for you. But you don\u2019t become Taylor Swift that way. It takes an army.

Watching our own government be immune to our experience, and the social temperature regarding abortion is another fatal failure for humanity. This is deadly. Assigning felonies to people who seek abortion is a means to assure that those with that autonomy are stripped of their right to vote. And therefore perpetuates the cycle. i\u2019ve always been open about my struggle with reproductive health and pregnancy. what happens to the body that I live in, that you live, is nobody else\u2019s choice. i\u2019m working on a long form video on up subject, but can\u2019t just keep my mouth shut till it\u2019s finished. watching the demise of our reproductive rights sends a sickening rage through my core. autonomy is the basis of our humanity. the ability to feel and the right to choose. can\u2019t. it speaks for itself. \ud83d\udda4 https://t.co/caybDAH79T all cowboy-ed out. gonna take off my makeup and make some ginger tea and listen to NIGHTMARE 100 times love u bye xo https://t.co/q3KEnfDvxn RT @cedricjoshuaa: C\u2019MON LITTLE LADY GIVE US A SMILE.

Haha. @iamsuckeriam @illvminatro Oat milk is superior @campcopes I intended noooo aggression! I was just asking a genuine question in case something outside of my own experience went unnoticed to me!

Haha please talk to your doctors!!!! Love you guys! \u2764\ufe0f @shilooooh @visitkingdoms You are completely correct that was a mistype. Most of the people I have talked to about the experience are Cis women and that was entirely my mistake ! @autumnrebeccaaa A laparoscopic surgery! They take a camera and put it through your belly button and 2-4 small incisions on your waist line and go look for endometriosis cells in your uterus and abdomen! They are blue you can see them! Haha @visitkingdoms The insertion causes cramps for a few days but I think it\u2019s been largely over exaggerated. Once again it\u2019s different for everyone. I think medical anxiety causes a lot of the tension because most women get by with an Advil the first day. But some it\u2019s different! @bronas_jothers @isabelleprimave I never even feel it! It doesn\u2019t bother me at all, and the initial pain of insertion was a small price to pay in exchange for managing the debilitating pain endometriosis causes. my IUD helps me get on stage every night I love it! @halseycvlt @isabelleprimave Well I have a reproductive illness so it\u2019s the best option for me but everyone is different! @devilsheadlight @isabelleprimave Yeah I take a daily pill for endo pain in combination with my IUD but no matter the dosage, I can\u2019t really control if my hormones give me my cycle or break through bleeding lol @shilooooh @isabelleprimave It\u2019s different for everyone. I didn\u2019t get it the first year and now it\u2019s back. @isabelleprimave wow we are getting really personal on the time line. Lol.

They can disguise themselves as other illnesses and symptoms from one illness can play off symptoms of another.

You helped me fight my way out of my own personal mental badlands &amp; allowed me to emerge stronger. You are all an integral part of my development. I am nothing without you. I\u2019m a human built out of your voices, laughter + tears. You built me into an artist who is so lovingly attached to every one of you. I see the \u201clightning in your eyes\u201d when the first few notes of Roman Holiday play. The vindication when Control begins. Your voices carrying the chorus of New Americana. Your lights in the sky for Drive. You guys made Badlands special. There are b sides on that album PLATINUM bc u picked the songs that spoke to you + didn\u2019t need some campaign to tell u. You make creating a setlist near impossible bc every song is a \u201cfan fav\u201d. You wrote your own story into the fabric of that album Badlands Air was pretty legendary! We created an entire fake airline and had people go to an actual fake travel agency to pick up fake boarding passes / passports to enter an album release concert at a secret location? the attention to detail TRULY jumped out \u2708\ufe0f\u2708\ufe0f\u2708\ufe0f https://t.co/Nhkzf7V5Co Haha a bunch of awkward/cute shit very similar to the first day we met.

Details coming shortly \ud83d\udcab RT @coupdemain: \ud83c\udf19 @halsey and @LaurenJauregui portray the beat down of a toxic relationship in the music video for 'Strangers' https://t.co\u2026 RT @RecordingAcad: Things are heating up with epic music festivals this summer.

Tix on sale on Monday morning RT @SeanMcElwee: CHILDREN ARE ATTEMPTING SUICIDE https://t.co/AXPVJ7Lyt5 https://t.co/rfDwZlPxCL https://t.co/bm2PceNuMw No there\u2019s something else coming at the end. Will help piece everything together \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/reQ4hrvQR6 im so proud of the Strangers video Lauren &amp; I trained really hard to pull off those boxing scenes. My heart broke when I saw the 1st cut seeing us get bloodied + bruised and equating it to the metaphor the vid is meant to represent. That\u2019s really how a toxic relationship can feel Well the male character Solis (meaning sun) is Juliet (\u201cand juliet is the sun\u201d) so my character Luna is Romeo and therefore the moon. Also the moon is often portrayed as a sapphic woman. Rosaline (Rosa) is the woman that Romeo (Luna) desires before he meets Juliet. https://t.co/phMCiVg76c It literally IS a bisexual story. Luna has romantic relationships with both Rosa and Solis. Her relationship with a man doesn\u2019t nullify her bisexuality. Not in an imaginary music video universe and not in real life either !!!!!! Ok!!!!!! https://t.co/xVP73hwdeS \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f https://t.co/qw88ViHrrf The video isn\u2019t \u201cstraight\u201d. The video is part of a series in a concept album about my actual life. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f https://t.co/AwWz3XddhS Luna and Rosa are a couple. Who are forced to fight and it breaks Luna\u2019s heart to have to fight the person she loves. Much like it feels being a toxic relationship. https://t.co/b16Fl4sGId I just wanted the metaphor to apply to any kind of relationship. It was a hard situation. The song is obviously my effort towards greater representation but I didn\u2019t want to make the clickbait sexy vid everyone wanted, cause it does no justice to the narrative of the song I wrote https://t.co/HtjnqvMCxN The vid is a metaphor for a toxic relationship. You beat eachother down as u get weaker &amp; more desperate ur shots get dirty &amp; you fight cheap. You lose sight of what ur even fighting for. When someone finally wins, what have they really won? won a fight. lost the person you love Strangers Music Video \ud83d\udcab\n https://t.co/9ESdWMM85c @LaurenJauregui RT @sexdritylove: \"for you to truly understand the ending, I have to take you back to the start\" #strangersvideo @halsey https://t.co/7E64U\u2026 @visitkingdoms Wowwwww this is a forbidden file.
