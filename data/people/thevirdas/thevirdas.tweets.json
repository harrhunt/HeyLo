But gotta say it's hilarious to see literally thousands of shaky Indian men get mobilized over a tweet, all the while proclaiming how secure they are in their policymakers \ud83e\udd26 I know. Why can't aunty just be happy with the life you think is enough? These women and their silly dreams. https://t.co/sxcXfQBub6 Agreed. But it's not a gang. It's individuals. Tukde fairy. Tukde claus.

I had no idea Rihanna went to JNU. Bakt. https://t.co/NX8CU8vwOj Asking for a friend. If a foreigner talks about Indian farmers, why is that so upsetting?

If comedians are to be held accountable for four year old jokes that harmed no-one, hurt a few sentiments, but were still on a public platform...can leaders be held accountable for 5,10,15,20 year old speeches that actually led to things?

Jokes about God are wrong, got it. But jokes about people who get upset about jokes about God are cool right? If you are a comedian, grab whatever you write on, and please write more jokes than you ever have before. Jokes that outlive this version of us. The only way is through. Hey folks. I know there's a lot of people disappointed with the Delhi shows being pushed.

Moving on. https://t.co/Fqn559z1fe Workout for me, cooldown for him. https://t.co/cVhR9EE0WX For something i'm writing. Respond to this statement:\n.\nThe Hallmark of free speech is that you have to entertain all opinions peacefully, especially the ones you don't like. \nBut your response HAS to be through free speech, like ritualised combat. No other means allowed. I was thinking. It's going to be a year exactly. Maybe on Republic Day we all, find an hour, have a reunion and watch it? \ud83d\ude4f\ud83e\udd17\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\n#VirDasForIndia https://t.co/ROlh2evijL @roshanabbas @KOMMUNEity Say the word sir.

The main target isn't our pen, it's your throat. Madam. With respect. Indian comedians stand for eachother. We help eachother and stand for eachother. We are tiny group, too small to fight large systems. We need you the audience who listens to, and enjoys comedy, to stand with us.

The biggest side effect of the vaccine is turning everyone I know into an armchair epidemiologist. Timeline is full of people saying \"Who don't you do jokes about all the religions?\". \n\nI honestly agree with you. Do them all equally. Anyone who watches me knows I have. \n\nIt's just sad that we expect religious democracy and equality from comedy that we cannot get in reality. The primary difference between a comedian and a politician in India is when a comedian says something offensive about another religion there are consequences for the comedian. When a politician says something offensive there are consequences for the religion. Business class on Vistara Goa Mumbai. \nEntire front row not wearing face shields and masks around their chins. Behind them, us and a very scared  woman in her 70s.\nAir hostesses asked politely twice.

Yes I did, but then I also wrote a lot of jokes and raised some money with them. How are you a keyboard warrior? Did you just type or what? https://t.co/a53b2tocI5 This was so so much fun to perform on. Do listen \n:-) https://t.co/YMfYlyBO4J Prediction. Tonight 2 or 3 news channels will do 3-4 min segments with a headline like 'No country for comedy'. 3-5 panelists plus 1 comedian will discuss Indian comedy and achieve a .001% jump in ratings before returning to 165 detailed pictures of people in the Maldives. \u270a Cannot wait to have a journalist review another Indian comedy special and say it wasn't 'edgy enough' or that it was 'too safe' and we need to 'push the envelope more'. Hilarious \ud83d\ude01 If you don't like it, don't watch it......but make sure to react to it. You know this might be the most asked question I get. Because it's funny. And because I want people to understand that threatening comedians will only result in more jokes \ud83d\ude01 https://t.co/MXiYDAHwxX @MasalaBai I don't advise the career change.

Perform for Pakistani people all the time. Stop constantly sending Indians to pakistan \ud83e\udd26 What are you? A patriot or a travel agent? https://t.co/M8SYwwSDod I'm just going to leave this here. https://t.co/C8eqqDzPya You can't stop jokes and laughter. Not because comedians are performing it, but because people need to laugh. Harder you try, the more you're going to be laughed at, now, and by history. \n\nAnyone who has ever tried to control humour, now has a category of jokes devoted to them. I really think someone needs to design an 'offended questionnaire' feature for content. \n\nThree questions, multiple choice, that determine how offended you're going to be and politely warns you in advance.\n\nTerrible idea, but making people read before watching, is a great filter. Second day of no sugar and waking up at 6am to write before everyone wakes up.\n\nI've written five pages about how I hate everything and everyone. Repeat after me. Just because politics is a virus doesn't mean a vaccine is political. My fav dude guy at a restaurant is the guy taking photos of his girl for her insta and constantly being handed back the phone because they aren't good enough and the angle is wrong.

Money is going to be made anyway. Might as well make the profit and the margin official. Make it private so there's consequences for stealing, as opposed to public sector where you can't even check it. Also...i tell jokes and i'm not that smart. This is just me thinking out loud. \nOk bye. Your audits have to all be above water and all your information has to be public. Pharma company gets to recover some risk they've taken during the pandemic, and we citizens get to ensure other's safety irrespective of govts, elections and more. As an example. If it costs 1000 rupees to make at cost. Charge me 10,000. take 10% to recover your distribution costs, that's 900 gone. And spend 8100 on vaccinating eight people for every one of me. I would like to know who they were and when they got it, digitally. Might as well make it over the table and official. I am willing to pay a high amount if you can provide what this costs to make ;at cost', declare your margin and make sure a certain number of disenfranchised people receive it for free. If it costs 1000 rupees I mean let's be honest. India isn't changing overnight. The minute this thing becomes available, along with the frontline workers, and military personal and essential workers getting it for free...every VIP with a friend is gonna pay something under the table for it anyway. I also don't see it succeeding as a tax, because of how few of us pay taxes. Maybe something private sector where we directly pay a pharma company that is responsible for dispensing free vaccines in an accountable fashion. I just don't think it's going to get done for those who need it, unless those who can afford it step in and insist and put their money where their mouth is. I don't think big business is going to step in, I don't see the govt funding 1.3 billion vaccines in a timely fashion. Thoughts on people above a certain annual income paying a decent amount for the covid vaccine, so that the money/margin you put in could provide free vaccines for others? #Bengaluru, the #SeeYouOutside tour is dropping by in 2 WEEKS!

If you're jokes are good enough, you'll never have to talk about them after you deliver them. Love them or hate them, other people will talk about them for you. You can just do the joke.

Where 55 year old men who DON'T look like Milind Soman start running naked on the beach. Two cents. He wants to lose. I don't think he wanted the job in the first place. He wanted the campaign ratings to ressurect his brand and then he won. He's doing the legal stuff to save face. He's going to be very successful as a businessman now. \n\nAlso...This rum is strong. A slow motion representation of every music festival and concert in the near future. https://t.co/PQGO0lS0eE All across America, late night show comedy writing teams are trying to figure out what the hell they're going to talk about for four years. #Goa, we all SOLD OUT for Friday &amp; Saturday!

Two males fighting over the mail. Hurry up America. This is what happens when you learn counting on Sesame Street. It's math. https://t.co/VG2HJ8s81n Here's a story. When I was 26 years old I did news comedy show NEWS ON THE LOOSE on CNBC. We took on leaders, tycoons, authors and culture in general at the end of the prime time 9pm bulletin. If I said even 25% of what we were able to say then on TV today, I'd be in jail. https://t.co/XySH5iK4TJ Sure. It's not. https://t.co/BgMUQIUR1r Hey. Because I want to live in India. https://t.co/iSMCuPDnDS Depending on when you stop counting the votes....Kanye won. #USElection2020 Well...at least it's Trump's last election. @ShikharGupta25 Muh me ghee shakkar. Democrats in the US are starting the 'don't give up, there's still....' tweets. \ud83d\ude14 I see a lot of govt ministers tweeting \"We condemn the attack on freedom of the press\"........and then adding a \"In Maharashtra\" after it. \n\nWhich is very smart....and accurate. Nandish.\n\nHuman dicks don't actually have spines.\nThere's also so space between the dick and the head.\n \nYou're either a chimpanzee, or you need to see a doctor \ud83d\ude01\n\nGood luck. https://t.co/bFfQ79IS4g You're. Example: 'You're a dumbass.' \ud83d\ude01 https://t.co/uxiTBMGCjz For the record, I don't think it's correct to take Arnab into custody forcibly for things he said. Slippery slope. I just know that had this happened to an outspoken artist, he'd be celebrating and getting ratings off it. So it's honestly very hard to feel sympathy. I don't think it's right to take Arnab into custody. If you want to punish him, make him watch the news. Morning America.....do we know? do we wanna know? Macaulay.

So much attention on the crazy things he says. Time that could be spent being confident and focussing on what Biden says. Projecting a vision, not just reacting to illusion. GOA!

Watch the rapid testing market closely. That's the key to restarting live events at scale. Asking people to show up early, rapid testing, and then letting them in to an event where they still abide by covid rules, but don't have to worry. To add two this, the courts will decide whether to recognise two separate same sex marriages. And while that seems specific, it's larger than that, and important. Tomorrow, the Indian courts will decide whether to legalize same sex marriage in India.

Shocking. Just shocking. \n\nHow dare they behave like their audience? They've got no right. But more dangerously....AI algorithms only giving people the facts and news they themselves want to see. \n\nIt's like you're cooking your own facts, and you're not that smart to begin with, so neither are your facts. The sentence that stuck with me from The Social Dilema:\n\nIf you ask yourself how the hell the other side see's this information and reacts the way they do...answer is...they don't. \n\nThe danger of social networks is giving people the news and facts they want them to see.

A comic starting out who will soon have 10 or 15, a comic who just threw away an hour of material, a comic who just put a special out...at some point...almost once a year...we all wind up with just five minutes. https://t.co/ZePId7K05x Which is not to say there isn't humongous room for improvement in gender equality, entry systems, economics, censorship etc. But when you are on stage, there's not much that can take attention away form your talent. It's yours to own and yours to bomb on. The thing I love about comedy, barriers to entry aside, is that it's democratic. On any given night, the kid with five minutes is better than the headliner with 45. Your background doesn't matter, and fame buys you two minutes of grace time, and then you all have to bring it.

Anyone who hates you, is choosing you too \ud83d\ude42 https://t.co/izUnn7ab1V I'm pretty sure the day the vaccine goes out to people is the day that Indian uncles will learn how to wear their mask properly. Right now it just kind of hangs below their nose....a wonderful accessory. It's just plain ironic to see news channels and media houses do long bulletins about equality and fairness in the entertainment industry. No one has done as much damage as you, no one panders to stars more than you, and no one is milking a tragic death for ratings more than you. Ji sir. Main wohi hoon.

When the lockdown started I decided I was going to quit sugar, get healthy, lose three kilos and get to 10% body fat. \n\nAfter a very long and taxing lockdown, I have finally reached my goal and lost that decision. In my school history books there were chapters about governments that tried to delete chapters from history books. \n\nYou can't write your place in history. It's a battle you won't win.

Is a pretty valid question. \n\nI don't know the answer. I do like the question. You watch enough wildlife documentaries and you realize, the cuter the animal...the higher the chances it does some really messed up stuff. Great thread. But archaic concepts of stardom are changing. Some digital creators have larger community and consumption than a lot of \u2018stars\u2019.

Who work for the boss they do, and have to keep a straight face. Their lives, their stories. Would produce it and write it in a second, if there was even one platform willing to air it. \ud83d\ude42 It's kind of ironic when an Indian man who built a career on screaming suddenly and without warning screams the words 'suddenly and without warning' suddenly and without warning. #ArnabGoswami Loving these cute videos of news panelists at home being interrupted by their children \ud83d\ude42\n\nAs opposed to Indian news, where children are interrupting eachother.

We're quickly realising that merely pointing out the other side's failures during election time isn't actually a valid plan for running a country.\n\nNow many people will call me an idiot. Which is true. But calling an idiot... Twitter. It's a dumpster fire that is now fully a sponsored conversation. Most sane people have moved on. If you question authority you're probably followed by more people who hate you than like. So If you still stick around to ask questions that need to be asked, I salute you \u270a A microphone is a mouthpiece. It does not have it's own voice. You've got to plug it in, power it, amplify it. By itself, it's essentially empty and useless. \n\nThis is why you should stop expecting better from party spokespersons. @Apurvasrani @DanishSait Thanks guys \ud83e\udd17 you're both amazing!

Very interesting conversation with a prof about twitter. He said that the relevance of a platform is driven by organic conversation, which is why this platform will soon be irrelevant.
