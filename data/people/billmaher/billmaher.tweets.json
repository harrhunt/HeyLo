Let's go to the bullpen and bring in a real ace. Biden should step aside and let @NYGovCuomo be the nominee! Man, this really brings new meaning to 'same shit, different day.' 30 days has September, April, June and November, all the rest have 31. Except March, which has a million apparently. But...Real Time will be back one week from tonight, April 3. Yes, from my backyard. So...no handshakes, kisses, hugs, fistbumps or gatherings, got it. But quick question: that thing where people spit in their hand and then shake on it - where are we with that? I know people mean well when they ask \"Are you safe?\" but I feel the net effect is empty shelves at the grocery store. Am I safe? Yes. Rationally, I feel I'm about as safe as I was before Corona, minus a small percentage. Life is not, and was never, completely safe. ...living like this? If - a hypothetical - they found that what went into making smart phones was part of the problem, would you give up your phone to be able to go to a bar? If you have to think about that, you've already lost your humanity. You're already a droid. What if this virus - and others to come - is somehow connected to how much we've ratfucked the environment? When we upset one thing in nature, it tends to have repercussions down the line. One long fire season here in Cali then became the new normal. Is anything worth...

People are asking why the Germans are getting the virus less - I think its because they wash their Hans. Come on people, we have to keep laughing! Day One of the quarantine, and I'm already bored. There were people in bars when I drove home from the studio last night. Why cancel every other thing, and then have people go to a bar where you're close, touching money, glasses and each other, and drunk? I see people are calling #coronavirus the Wuhan flu on twitter.

He didn't make the decision to exonerate Trump last week; he made it 9 months ago. Democrats need to stop having faith in \"good\" Republicans saving them. It didn't come from Comey, or Mueller, or Rosenstein, and it won't come from Kasich or Romney or William Weld or anyone else. You're going to have to do it yourself. As crooked as Barr is starting to look, the difference in reaction to this report finally coming out is profound: we accept, discuss legal alternatives,etc. If the report said guilty, they would have gone apeshit, accepted nothing and threatened violence. Trump is already on to calling for \"looking into the other side\", i e revenge on the conspirators.

That's your guy? I know \"I'm with her\" was a lame slogan, but knowing who Trump is, your deal is \"I'm with him\"? With that scummy human being? Got it. According to Cohen, Trump gets a shill to overbid for a painting of him at auction so he can say his portrait went for the most of anyone, then has his charity pay for it, then keeps it himself. Even if there's no Russian collusion (there is), or other criminality (there is)..

That was Alec Baldwin, right? Not a single question about climate change in all 3 debates. Sad. No, really - sad. Brilliant closing, Don: \"vote for her and you get 4 more years of Obama\" - a president with a 55% approval rating. This was by far Hillary's best debate, bravo. But that jacket makes me want to ask her to cut me a slab of prime rib. Until a month ago, Trump thought Aleppo was Omarosa's brother. #Debatenight I'm trying to remember, when we invaded Iraq in 2003, yes of course it was all Hillary's doing, but wasn't there someone else...Bush maybe? I never realized Hillary was the emperor of the world for the last 30 years, solely responsible for every bad thing that ever happened. Hmm. Oh for fuck sake, if Trump was any more of a pussy he'd have to grab himself. #Debatenight When will Trump realize that saying \"Wrong!\" makes him look like a #WhinyLittleBitch ? Trump: I didn't even apologize to my wife! I wrote her a check, like always. Right, the 73 yr old woman he groped on a plane wants \"fame\" - hoping to parlay this into a movie career and start dating James Franco. Man, Hillary's debate prep was worth every minute, his predictable insults are getting overhead slammed. Also, Cubs up by 4. Hey, Hillary, what about Trump's excellent plan to help small business by taking women furniture shopping? Trump talking about creating millions of new jobs - Billy Bush at home saying, \"Well you lost me mine!\" Hillary looks like a president. Like a president dealing with an idiot at a town hall. #Debatenight This got nasty fast. But remember, when he goes low, I get high. #Debatenight We know he's a five year old, but does he really have to say \"You're the puppet!\" \"No, you are!\" And this guy is still in the race? Jesus. Is \"bigly\" a word? No, its not. That should be disqualifying itself! Hillary doesn't want to put immigrants on buses, where they'll just be egged on by Billy Bush. #debatenight Also, the sniffling kicks in when he starts talking about drugs. Sad. So far, she is killing him, and he sounds like he knows he's toast. Also sounds like he's about 2 cigars away from an electrolarynx Trump on fetuses: In 20 years, they'll be dating me! Don't forget \"Go to Hillary Clinton dot com\" is code for \"He's a lying sack of shit\" Telling that right off the bat, Trump makes the Supreme Court question about HIM! As always, he was insulted!Thats all that matters, people! They're letting Hillary talk - its rigged!! Debate prediction: Closest we get to talk of climate change tonight is when Trump mentions his daughter keeps getting hotter. Looking forward to the Dorito-colored douchebag melting down tonight &amp; tweeting the play by play!

OK, I don't know how Bill Cosby got his knock-out drugs into their green room drinks, but this snooze fest is boring, like Dem Debate boring Btw, \"Waste, Fraud and Abuse\" was the curriculum at Trump University. Huh, new tactic here for Republicans - actually paying attention to facts? What the hell happened tonight? I'm bored. Who's dick is bigger?? Had to run out for a sec - do they still hate Mexicans? Ben Carson endorsing Trump, wow. And Trump brags, of course: \"so honored to be endorsed by the guy I called a child molester\" Also, not surprised Goofy endorsed Trump Trump: \"Only I can stop me from fucking America's workers!\" Not fair to ask Marco about Disney World! They know he's not tall enough to get on the rides! Trump very \"low energy\" so far. No joy in it for him unless another of the monkeys is hurling poop his way. Come on, get to the pissing contest. Although, after the last debate, that could literally come true Kasich kicks off Republican debate with sanity and hope - that's like kicking off an orgy with a bible verse OK,gonna try to watch with you; I pre-apologize for that moment when I just can't take these insufferable assholes 1 more minute.

Times up, wrong party. Not that it hasn't been all along, but now its just sad. I feel like the Indian in the old PSA with the tear rolling down his cheek. Dr. Ben Carson: no wins, 2nds, 3rds or even 4ths. Dr. Ben, maybe you shld think about...Dr. Ben? Dr. BEN!! All right, I'll come back later. So far Trump is proving something I've always maintained about American politics: You throw your lot in with the Klan, you can win the South Well if this night doesnt put an end to racism and childfucking, i dont know what will!! Yes! Leo won! Finally, some light in this man's life! This is so exciting: is it the one i never heard of or the one i didnt see?

Its that time in the debate where my mind is drifting Wait,did Ben Carson just actually admit he fell asleep? Kasich looks like the college professor where you drop the class after the first day Well, Trump is right about one thing: the world is laughing at us. OK guys, we get it, Isis is bad, but first, America's greatest threat: Mexican cleaning ladies! Ben Carson got in! Yeah! Now, back to looking like he's ignoring a rape on the subway...

So we're not the world's policeman, but we'll bomb and torture anyone anywhere for any reason? Should THEY be calling a policeman? of all the issues they are infuriating about...lambasting Obama for not doing...exactly what he's already doing, always takes the cake And one more thing: Do you get to say \"New Yorkers are garbage people\" if you're a Cuban from Calgary? And by the way, what is a New York value? A studio apartment for $2,500 a month. Value - that's a steal! Cruz to New York: Drop dead. If we didn't have the stupid electoral college, they couldn't write off THIRTY EIGHT STATES! Of course Trump is for arming everyone, he's got the bulletproof hair! \"Isis does not get their guns from gun shows\". True - they get them from the U S military. How many humvees did they capture in Mosul? Yes, when Obama said Rednecks cling to their guns and their religion...way off on that one. Oh Jeb, does Fla. really get to weigh in on guns? The one with the law \"If you make me nervous, I get to shoot you?\" Well, that wasn't so bad. What, there's more? Shit. I'm playing Words with Friends with John Kasich right now! Christie: \"I vetoed a ban on guns that can shoot down airplanes and through the doors of squad cars.\" Applause. Wheres Isis when u need 'em? I've seen productions of Boys in the Band that weren't this bitchy. Man, for a Canadian, Cruz fights nasty like a...well, like an American! Trump to Cruz: \"I'm not bringing a suit, I promise\" - that's what he said to me before he sued me! The crows at the republican debate just booed the Wall St Journal. Welcome to the Bird Sanctuary Thank god, a commercial break. \"Back to more making you shit your pants, after this word from Depends!\" Saying we need to rebuild our military is like saying county fairs need more fried foods I like the audience shots - takes the myth that the Republicans are a bunch of angry old white people...and proves it Christie: \"If i'm president, Hillary won't get within ten miles of the white house\"- great, more bridge closures Love the way they now all say \"Sure, the millionaires are doing great...\" - and when I find the assholes who paved the way for that!... Haha, Cruz made sure he was first to say Obama's a pussy because our sailors got released, on a question about the economy. He's the worst!

Let's get to the part where Ben Carson attacks his mom with a hammer. Marco really studied his flash cards for this one! More welders, less philosophers! Yeah, that's,um, vaguely anti people i think i hate! gotta give it to Trump, he doesn't pander: 'Minimum wage? Fuck you, get rich or die, next question.' My first question for the debaters: This is on Fox Business channel, is that NON-LIBERAL enough for your pussy asses? Is it me, or does Reince Priebus look like that guy at the funeral home who comes in with the casket catalogue? About to live tweet the Repub debate, and the big question, How long will i last before i say \"Fuck these assholes, i feel physically ill!\"? #GOPDebate https://t.co/NiXBwwo7CA Did Jeb Bush really answer the question \"Would U kill baby Hitler?\"? Yes, he did. Why do ppl get mad at me for saying its a stupid country? Headin out to Ames, Iowa for some quality time with vote-begging Repubs! Also standup tonight at C Y Stephens at Iowa State!

Trump is right, Bush is low energy. He always looks like the guy who's in the car reading while his wife is in a store shopping. Debt relief?

No, not you Carson you crazy head case, Murphy!! oh my god did i just hear Ted Cruz say something awesome that i agree with? Yes. The media is even stupider than the pols. Who's on first? deGrom is mowing them down! And Kasich was pretty good mowing down Trump &amp; Carson on living in FantasyLand! Go Kasich! Wait, i mean Go Mets! The only way this debate is going to be survivable is if the Mets get out to a big lead. Then i don't care what Trump says. Like now. Oh lord,another debate with more STUPID QUESTIONS?! Asking \"What's your weakness?\" is an invitation to a humblebrag, fools! Back to the Mets You mean prophecies from 80s movies are NOT reliable?? Congratulations @Mets and one more series to go!

I think #BenCarson might have inhaled a little too much anesthesia 20 minutes on valet parkers without I D while flames from wildfires lick the walls of the Reagan library. HOW BOUT A CLIMATE QUESTION????? When does one of these assholes have the guts to call Reagan out for his amnesty for Mexicans? For the first time in this campaign, Trump is humbled (by Carly) and looked apologetic and not true to what he believes. Start of the end? Carly: I'd urge every American to watch these doctored, heavily edited, manipulated tapes and come to the false conclusion I have! How about asking the one woman on the stage about Planned Parenthood Quick question: When #TedCruz shaves in the morning, how does he avoid spitting in the mirror? #GOPDebate Bloodthirsty, factfree belligerence: Yayyy! Rand Paul's reasoned restraint: polite smattering. Dead Nixon just called Scott Walker: I want my lip sweat back! Carly explaining Republican diplomacy: I'm not talking to you! We insult you,and then you do what we say! Why is everyone overthinking this? When #BenCarson speaks, i keep waiting for one of those Lunesta butterflies to fly by \"I want to talk about serious, non-personal issues, but PizzaFace and Fatso here won't let me!\" Don't adjust your sets, Scott Walker's face really looks like that The conspiracy of delusion about how Obama wrecked America is astounding. Hello, unemployment is lower than Reagan ever had it! Two minutes in, and its kindergarden slams about who's ugly. Even professional wrestlers are like, Guys, c'mon...a little dignity. #ChrisChristie: Take the camera off me. American public: Good idea. To sum up opening statements: God bless America, too bad its such a shithole. #GOPDebate Jeb, lame opening. But, when he sees a plane inside a building he thinks of his brother, so he's a little off his game. #GOPDebate #BenCarson needs to chug a little red bull before the show. Nice gesture tho that he offered to separate Christie's conjoined chins Trump used to hang out with serious people like @LouFerrigno and @LaToyaJackson and now he has to share a stage with these losers. #Sad Must say, #ChrisChristie looks good tonight, he really - oh, wait, sorry, that's Air Force One 1st off, Air Force One in the background is confusing: CNN viewers are thinking, Wow, they found the missing plane!

Can't be an intellectual if U think Unicorns r real, or Klingons,or obvious myths from Bronze Age Congratulations to the Vatican on the new pope! And this time, they found one who never was a Nazi! (we hope, he's from Argentina) My spies tell me one of the frontrunners for pope is Cardinal Turkson, from Africa. But he showed up with 2 pitbulls,which was a big mistake Media, STOP saying Pope job so onerous- Ur selling an invisible product! Infallible, diplomatic immunity, life tenure - its the EASIEST job! Papal conclave has begun! So exciting, like the Oscars all over again- we all want to know:Who will win, and who's dress will he be wearing?

Popularity of gay marriage has really shot up in Calif! Can't believe its not legal here - after all, we have a bear right on our flag. OK you're right, enuf about the pope. I guess as former Catholic, I just want to leave him a message. Don't let the door hit you in the ass. Will he still get the discount at the Vatican Gift shop, stuff like that. As he himself said, Don't hate the praya, hate the game! So touchy about Pope-y! I'm just wishing him well in this difficult time of going from infallible to just another shmuck. Just sayin, based on how Catholics behave, Bennie was taken less seriously than the sign in the men's room not to throw things in the toilet That's not fair. They don't get arrested. So long, Pope-y! Been a great run,of a billion Catholics ignoring everything he said to do, and everyone he knows getting arrested for rape. This #Sequester shit is so submental - its like not having the willpower to diet, so rigging the refrigerator to blow up when you open it Going out to dinner - catch the end when I get home. Rooting for Lincoln. Always a pleasure to do Oscars with twitter compadres. Why work so hard to become famous and then make ur self unrecognizable? Memo to stars: HDTV is not your friend, hash tag Meow!! The In Memorium package always makes me ruminate on the fragility of life. And think about the people I WISH were dead. They must have a vat of oil, sparkle and Botox backstage.  And for the women... Adele is better than that song At this point in the show I feel like I want to be Bradley cooper choking down some fucking drug at a clinic. Lets get to Best Sound!!! If u graphed Oscars, Entertainment at first, then LONG LINE at bottom of graph for 6 hours,minimal entertainment , big finish, good night.

You're thinking of Marcus Bachmann Wow, what a shameless liar this Rubio guy is - Obama created more debt than Bush? Well, if you don't believe in science, why not math too? Fun time on Conan tonight -even tho something unfunny was going on at Big Bear during taping. Are we gonna have an O J split screen for SOU? The Pope can quit? WTF? He's Sarah Palin now?

U were one of the bestest, Hag And 'Grand Bargain' sounds like a meal at Taco Bell. Media, pls stop using term \"fiscal cliff\", when America is plunged into the unimaginable hell known as the Clinton tax rates Happy Thanksgiving everybody! Especially to the Indians who've endured so much. On tv they were the zombies of the 50s Any Dem who voted for corrupt, non-present, nuthouse- bound #jessejacksonjr needs to look in mirror - as bad as republican vote fraud shit! Glad Hillary was able to get a cease-fire in Gaza. Otherwise known as Stopping to Reload. Who'da guessed the Elmo guy wld be pervy just cuz he spent his life with his hand up a puppet's ass? Allegedly. #LiberalAgenda @BarackObama  (video clip @HBO #RealTime)  http://t.co/6BNUslm2 @avkwandrew Well, thanks, i'll have to put \"write gospel\" on my to-do list for this hiatus time! To the McDonalds proprietor in W Va who hung flag upside down blamed it on broken cable if I wanted to be fed bullshit I'd order the McRib This week John McCain missed a security briefing with answers on Benghazi to hold a press conference demanding answers on Benghazi Just read Twilight written by Mormon - makes sense, cuz like Romney its about a semihuman who lives in fantasy world and sucks on our blood Like the way Barry went after McCain and his girlfriend Lindsay today - winning 2nd term less like mandate and more like being denied parole #keepPetraeusOnTheJob - Isn't what's going on in Somalia and Pakistan more important than what's going on in his pants? Unless he was fucking Mata Hari as well, I still don't see why Petraeus had to go Big question these days is Can the Republicans evolve? Wld be helpful to believe in evolution first RT @CurrentSpitzer: Does the right-wing media exist in a bubble? #RealTime host @BillMaher will discuss w/ @EliotSpitzer \u2014 tonight at 8E ... Is it true that the original name of Paula Broadwell's Petraeus biography was \"Is It All In?\" Mitt won all the states where \"Lincoln\" is showing as \"Scary Movie 5\" Feeling kinda wistful just arrived in Akron for last standup show of the year tonight - election years really hard to let go of Here I am with my fav movie star - eat ur hearts out motherfuckers! http://t.co/JMjRSmI9 Obama won single women by THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT! The message to Republicans was clear: Get off of me. @FoxNews Failed #Predictions of @DickMorrisTweet (@Hardball w/@Hardball_Chris @msnbc video clip) http://t.co/ZmjQV4u8 Great victory for the people last night;people also still idiots: see Prop 37,they voted AGAINST knowing what they're putting in their mouth RT @rbpconcerts: Kick off President Obama's second term with Bill Maher in Hawaii New Years Eve. Tix @ http://t.co/7lhcXBBs\n@billmaher h ... Since Obama won almost all the swing states, and we somehow elected them our deciders, shouldn't that be considered a mandate? Also a classy speech, but message was clear: little girls with leukemia die under Repub.s, so its a good thing I pulled it out. Kinda true. I'm pulling for Michele Bachman in MN - can't lose ALL my punchlines in one night! Pretty classy speech, Mitt. Loved the line goading the \"job creators\" to get off their selfish hoarding asses and create some jobs. Tea Party has now cost the Republicans 5 senate seats. My next donation is going to them. Karl Rove in a huge public spat right now with math. I know its comfy in the bunker, but at some point you have to come up for cyanide pills Well that was a million dollars well spent. Mitt to his underwear: \"Magic my ass!!\" This victory that the Jackie Robinson of American politics is cruising to is more impt than the first;1 term=failure; he had to be a success Bad night for rich idiots. I just wish Conneticut had more elective offices for Linda McMahon to not win. Congrats Elizabeth Warren! And Scott Brown has that truck, so its no sweat moving. Sad for Richard Mourdock tho, turned out he wasn't viable Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Wisconsin...they're getting nervous on Planet Kolob O Reilly just said people vote for Obama cuz they \"want stuff\", then cited blacks, Latinos and women. White men in US? TOTALLY SELF-RELIANT! Bill O Reilly on Fox already preparing the bubble dwellers for the worst, blaming the coming loss on Sandy and Christie. Fatty the Fall Guy. Ah, the beloved election night ritual of watching Wolf Blitzer get utterly startled every time an actual number comes in @HuffPostLive live election interview 6:45pm ET: http://t.co/2BKhyPha Gonna go live tonight with @DanRatherReport  Tune in @AXS TV I know everyone's feeling stressed about the election - I suggest some deep breathing exercises - breathe in...hold the smoke..breathe out Obama: high marks for Sandy, but no pleasing some people - today Kanye with cast of Jersey Shore: \"Obama doesn't care about orange people\" Candidates exhausted at this point - Mitt got so disoriented today he started to state where he actually stands on an issue Hope u all remembered to set ur clocks back an hour last night. And if u vote Republican on Tuesday another 40 years. Just remember next prez prolly appoints Supreme Ct justice. In case it's Romney might want to start pulling out a little earlier. Just landed in Vegas - shows tonite and tomorrow at The Orleans last 2 stand ups before election! All Mitt Romney jokes must go! Now it's real - just did last show before election! Now it's either a 2nd Obama term or one of six possible Mitt Romneys Halloween 2012 - I'm a tiger in bed! http://t.co/A2lg0Ocx Looking forward to James Bond movie; Obama's like him cuz he's cool, has license to kill; and Mitt's like him cuz he's been 6 different guys Scientists say #HurricaneSandy likely linked to record ArcticSea loss this yr but fuck them they're just scientists what does the bible say? Look who came to my show in Bloomington - Indiana royalty. And \"Authority Song\" is in my walk in music http://t.co/skH5yjGX Republicans saying we may have to wait till Thurs to find out exactly how and where Obama's response to Hurricane Sandy was incompetent Got invited to World Series game after my standup show tonight in Detroit! First series game ever been to! http://t.co/NHBRlCmw With the future senator from Md. (If he listens to me) and the irreplaceable rep from Mass. http://t.co/I8eAbg4y #MittRomney hates Assad cuz he fooled us into thinking he was a moderate and what sort of duplicitous shit wld do that? I'm tired of every Republican politician being a medical supergenius on vaginas. I want to hear gynecologists talk about the national debt Assclown/Disgrace to NYC Donald Trump always bragging he's worth billions so his 5 mil offer to Obama really quite chincy. #Stupidcheapfuck OK, one last try: We have fewer Andrews Sisters and Ritz Brothers than we did in 1944.  So glad we're done with THAT! Mitt keeps taking issue with being criticized tonight - did they tell him this is a debate? First debate, all agreed, Obama lost; second one, i say he won, but Romney not trounced. But this one? Only bubbledwellers can say Mitt won OK Mitt, one more try: we have fewer catapults and barrels of boiling oil than we had in the crusades. Shorter version of Romney: Me strong. Obama weak. Hulk smash. You're losing, Mitt - bring up the fact that we have fewer knives and rocks than we did during the French and Indian War To clarify, Mitt is for moving heaven and earth, but only in regards to mining Yes yes yes! Hit em with \"I wldn't move heaven and earth to get bin Laden\" and \"I'd ask Pakistan's permission\" - Mitt, you were just WRONG! Oh no he din't - Romney said his ultimate BubbleFact, \"Apology Tour\" right in front of the guy who NEVER WENT ON ONE I've seen wider ideological differences between Jehovah's Witnesses I can't be the only one who's surprised to find out Buster Posey is a white guy. Sorry, flipped to the game. To Obama's point, I'm thinking our F-15s could defeat a statistically larger number of Red Barons THAT was the best yet! \"We have these things called aircraft carriers, governor, where planes land on them\".  Cathartic, Barry. Bob Scheiffer, could you ask about what's IN the military budget? If people knew specifics,\"I wouldn't cut nuttin'\" wouldn't sound so good Jobs, teachers, education - gentlemen, please, can we get back to killing foreigners? That's an amazingly specific number Mitt keeps pulling out of his ass, 12 million new jobs. But fellas, this is the foreign policy debate! Mitt's entire debate strategy: What he just said, but from a white guy Its good they agree armed Americans shld be involved with everyone, everywhere. We loved armed intervention like Paula Dean loves butter. Aside from talking points, Mitt doesn't know his Assad from a hole in the ground Mitt, you do know that most of America thinks Mali is one of Obama's daughters, right? Ha! Obama doing my editorial from a week ago: forget ideology, what about just BEING WRONG!! \"Kill our way out of this mess\" is the theme of every American movie not about talking animals or weddings Scheiffer's first question regurgitated right wing talking points.  But he probably lives there in Boca. Trouble already:  Mitt says he wants to impose sanctions on \"Romnesia\" Can't believe i have to tear myself away from the Giants-Cardinals game for this shit again. I mean, isn't debating exciting? I luv people at town halls who ask Obama the same basic whiny question: I voted for u... and I'm still me!!!! With the man of the moment. Laughed his ass off tonight at Sonoma State - stopped pecking at his food! http://t.co/C1xsNGcD Feel relief Octomom has decided, and it's Obama - she can influence thousands if voters. Or make them. Behind The #Binders @MittRomney's Lost Fundraiser @HBO #RealTime (video clip) http://t.co/bNTYinNd @MittRomney #GODFORBID - Mormon in America @HBO Real Time (video clip) http://t.co/nhVSIuUj To the Bangladeshi who tried to blow up Fed with 1000 lbs of fertilizer: why don't U use it to grow some fucking food! Now that #LanceArmstrong is banned from cycling, Nike,his charity and lost his titles, he has to figure out a way to unfuck Sheryl Crow @AnnCoulter, #Mugged @HBO #RealTime (video clip) http://t.co/a527Coah At least Obama had the good taste not to urinate on the corpse Libs should be as giddy as a dancing horse, no more Mr. Nice Guy, more Mr. T There it is! The 47%! Saved it as a haymaker for the end. Nice \"Govt does not create jobs\" - tell that to anyone who works in anything related to the internet. nothing moves voters like foreign currency devaluation If the tea party is still voting for this immigrant loving, non tax cutting, birth control loving protectionist they care only about winning A gun question? What country does this lady think she's living in? Candy checks Romney on how Obama DID call the Libya attackers terrorists! Obama applauded, Romney shown to be a liar. TKO Fact checkers could have nucleur weapons, they still couldn't get Romney to stop saying \"apology tour\" Up until 3 weeks ago, most Americans thought Benghazi was a TV doctor whoa, Candy just had to tell Romney to SIT THE FUCK DOWN! I'd say he had too much caffeine, but we know that can't be it If Romney gave some of these answers in primary debates, crowd wld have devoured him; nothing but a clump of magic undies and black hair dye Romney: Some of my favorite servants are immigrants! thought bubble over Romney's head \"Say, this Obama fella is starting to make a lot of sense...\" i wonder how long it took some of these undecided voters to decide on an outfit to wear Not cool: after Obama and Romney cross paths on stage, Romney checks for his wallet \"Governor, you're the last person whos gonna get tough on China\" finally, Barry seems to not be worrying about looking like angry black man Great question, how Mitt is different than Bush. Answer: not! His 5 point plan is same as Bush's. Which was also McCain's. See a pattern? Do i love women? Golly, my great grandfather married eight! Wow, Mitt had whole binders full of woman. Just like a Morman. Batman style graphics should be popping up: POW! SLAM! Mitt's tax plan is like his underwear: magic Mitt has gone a subway stop past confident to Arrogant -\"of course my numbers add up, i was in business\" -businessmen don't ever lie! Mitt knows anytime you tick off a 5 point plan people thinks its good. Doesn't matter what the 5 are, one can be taxing refrigerator magnets Halleluhia! Nurses and drywallers won't have to pay tax on their dividends! Both of them are trying to roll over Candy Crowley.  And that can't be easy. Mitt is the kind of prep school bully who tells the president of the United States \"you'll get your chance\". Amazing to think Romney is old enough to be Obama's dad...hey wait a minute Mitt Romney is a fracking liar Romney just totally lost the bird vote first sign of Obama success: Andrew Sullivan loosening ligature around neck Welcome back, Black Ninja. first lie: Romney is not for keeping Pell grants 100 people around stage - Mitt sees more than that at his breakfast table Settling in with the popcorn for another live tweet debate play by play in a couple of hours...stay tuned The economy IS getting better - I saw a guy today with a sign Will Work For Organic Produce I really think this election comes down to one thing - is Mitt Romney too white to be president? #BigBirdLittleBen #ARGO's @BenAffleck #PBS (@HBO RealTime video clip) http://t.co/tUgBLVIi O fuck #LindsayLohan is voting for Romney. And u know what they say, if you've lost Lindsay Lohan..U can locate her with the ankle bracelet Finally, if Obama had been this strong, the election would be over now.  I predict he will be in the next two, so off the ledge, Sullivan! Oh just shup up all of ya, i want to watch football. All that's left is for Biden to throw Ryan a handkerchief:\"Here, clean yourself up kid\" Ryan is the kind of guy who shakes your hand extra hard to let you know he's been working out. Man, Joe Biden is clean and articulate! And btw Martha, what a truly horrible question this is on abortion and Catholics. Child, please! your running mate changed his position on abortion twice in 24 hrs this week! Shorter waiting periods for actual abortions! Ryan's is winning who knows to hydrate more. That's a big tell when you keep going to the water. But flopsweat don't replace itself! Let's just say it: even in HD, Biden's plugs look pretty good Ryan's hair is sweating. I'm actually starting to feel sorry for Ryan. But it wld be cool if Biden made him cry Why do Romney/Ryan keep arguing for Woodrow Wilsons's navy? Joe is not afraid to interrupt Ryan. Or himself. Besides the words, Joe's face is winning This isn't the kind of \"feeling the burn\" Ryan enjoys This Biden guy is awesome! I hope he keeps that nice sleepy black guy on the ticket! Hello 9 1 1? There s an old man beating a child on my tv \"Let me tell you about the Mitt Romney i know\" - too late, he's changed again Roethlisberger must get the ball out of his hand quicker. Sorry, wrong channel Biden is hitting in one answer all the things Obama left out in the entire first 90 minute debate Debates are better when they're sitting, they talk more like people talk when they're just sitting around. Beers would make it even better. Republicans sure have a point about Benghazi - what kind of clueless incompetent lets Al Qaida attack Americans on Sept 11?"}
