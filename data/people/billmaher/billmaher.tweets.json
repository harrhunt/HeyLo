Let's go to the bullpen and bring in a real ace. Biden should step aside and let @NYGovCuomo be the nominee! Man, this really brings new meaning to 'same shit, different day.' 30 days has September, April, June and November, all the rest have 31. Except March, which has a million apparently. But...Real Time will be back one week from tonight, April 3. Yes, from my backyard. So...no handshakes, kisses, hugs, fistbumps or gatherings, got it. But quick question: that thing where people spit in their hand and then shake on it - where are we with that? I know people mean well when they ask \"Are you safe?\" but I feel the net effect is empty shelves at the grocery store. Am I safe? Yes. Rationally, I feel I'm about as safe as I was before Corona, minus a small percentage. Life is not, and was never, completely safe. ...living like this? If - a hypothetical - they found that what went into making smart phones was part of the problem, would you give up your phone to be able to go to a bar? If you have to think about that, you've already lost your humanity. You're already a droid. What if this virus - and others to come - is somehow connected to how much we've ratfucked the environment? When we upset one thing in nature, it tends to have repercussions down the line. One long fire season here in Cali then became the new normal. Is anything worth...

Chet Hanks: \"They're both fine, they're not that sick, they're not worried about it, they're not tripping...\" It\u2019s a lot easier for Republicans to provide aid in a crisis, because they don\u2019t have the other party fighting them the way Democrats do, as after the financial cras of \u201808. People are asking why the Germans are getting the virus less - I think its because they wash their Hans. Come on people, we have to keep laughing! Day One of the quarantine, and I'm already bored. There were people in bars when I drove home from the studio last night. Why cancel every other thing, and then have people go to a bar where you're close, touching money, glasses and each other, and drunk? I see people are calling #coronavirus the Wuhan flu on twitter.

He didn't make the decision to exonerate Trump last week; he made it 9 months ago. Democrats need to stop having faith in \"good\" Republicans saving them. It didn't come from Comey, or Mueller, or Rosenstein, and it won't come from Kasich or Romney or William Weld or anyone else. You're going to have to do it yourself. As crooked as Barr is starting to look, the difference in reaction to this report finally coming out is profound: we accept, discuss legal alternatives,etc. If the report said guilty, they would have gone apeshit, accepted nothing and threatened violence. Trump is already on to calling for \"looking into the other side\", i e revenge on the conspirators.

That's your guy? I know \"I'm with her\" was a lame slogan, but knowing who Trump is, your deal is \"I'm with him\"? With that scummy human being? Got it.

Even if there's no Russian collusion (there is), or other criminality (there is)..

That was Alec Baldwin, right? Not a single question about climate change in all 3 debates. Sad. No, really - sad. Brilliant closing, Don: \"vote for her and you get 4 more years of Obama\" - a president with a 55% approval rating. This was by far Hillary's best debate, bravo. But that jacket makes me want to ask her to cut me a slab of prime rib. Until a month ago, Trump thought Aleppo was Omarosa's brother. #Debatenight I'm trying to remember, when we invaded Iraq in 2003, yes of course it was all Hillary's doing, but wasn't there someone else...Bush maybe? I never realized Hillary was the emperor of the world for the last 30 years, solely responsible for every bad thing that ever happened. Hmm. Oh for fuck sake, if Trump was any more of a pussy he'd have to grab himself. #Debatenight When will Trump realize that saying \"Wrong!\" makes him look like a #WhinyLittleBitch ? Trump: I didn't even apologize to my wife! I wrote her a check, like always. Right, the 73 yr old woman he groped on a plane wants \"fame\" - hoping to parlay this into a movie career and start dating James Franco. Man, Hillary's debate prep was worth every minute, his predictable insults are getting overhead slammed. Also, Cubs up by 4. Hey, Hillary, what about Trump's excellent plan to help small business by taking women furniture shopping? Trump talking about creating millions of new jobs - Billy Bush at home saying, \"Well you lost me mine!\" Hillary looks like a president. Like a president dealing with an idiot at a town hall. #Debatenight This got nasty fast. But remember, when he goes low, I get high. #Debatenight We know he's a five year old, but does he really have to say \"You're the puppet!\" \"No, you are!\" And this guy is still in the race? Jesus. Is \"bigly\" a word? No, its not. That should be disqualifying itself! Hillary doesn't want to put immigrants on buses, where they'll just be egged on by Billy Bush. #debatenight Also, the sniffling kicks in when he starts talking about drugs. Sad. So far, she is killing him, and he sounds like he knows he's toast. Also sounds like he's about 2 cigars away from an electrolarynx Trump on fetuses: In 20 years, they'll be dating me! Don't forget \"Go to Hillary Clinton dot com\" is code for \"He's a lying sack of shit\" Telling that right off the bat, Trump makes the Supreme Court question about HIM! As always, he was insulted!Thats all that matters, people! They're letting Hillary talk - its rigged!! Debate prediction: Closest we get to talk of climate change tonight is when Trump mentions his daughter keeps getting hotter. Looking forward to the Dorito-colored douchebag melting down tonight &amp; tweeting the play by play!

OK, I don't know how Bill Cosby got his knock-out drugs into their green room drinks, but this snooze fest is boring, like Dem Debate boring Btw, \"Waste, Fraud and Abuse\" was the curriculum at Trump University. Huh, new tactic here for Republicans - actually paying attention to facts? What the hell happened tonight? I'm bored. Who's dick is bigger?? Had to run out for a sec - do they still hate Mexicans? Ben Carson endorsing Trump, wow. And Trump brags, of course: \"so honored to be endorsed by the guy I called a child molester\" Also, not surprised Goofy endorsed Trump Trump: \"Only I can stop me from fucking America's workers!\" Not fair to ask Marco about Disney World! They know he's not tall enough to get on the rides! Trump very \"low energy\" so far. No joy in it for him unless another of the monkeys is hurling poop his way. Come on, get to the pissing contest. Although, after the last debate, that could literally come true Kasich kicks off Republican debate with sanity and hope - that's like kicking off an orgy with a bible verse OK,gonna try to watch with you; I pre-apologize for that moment when I just can't take these insufferable assholes 1 more minute.

Times up, wrong party. Not that it hasn't been all along, but now its just sad. I feel like the Indian in the old PSA with the tear rolling down his cheek. Dr. Ben Carson: no wins, 2nds, 3rds or even 4ths. Dr. Ben, maybe you shld think about...Dr. Ben? Dr. BEN!! All right, I'll come back later. So far Trump is proving something I've always maintained about American politics: You throw your lot in with the Klan, you can win the South Well if this night doesnt put an end to racism and childfucking, i dont know what will!! Yes! Leo won! Finally, some light in this man's life! This is so exciting: is it the one i never heard of or the one i didnt see?

Its that time in the debate where my mind is drifting Wait,did Ben Carson just actually admit he fell asleep? Kasich looks like the college professor where you drop the class after the first day Well, Trump is right about one thing: the world is laughing at us. OK guys, we get it, Isis is bad, but first, America's greatest threat: Mexican cleaning ladies! Ben Carson got in! Yeah! Now, back to looking like he's ignoring a rape on the subway...

So we're not the world's policeman, but we'll bomb and torture anyone anywhere for any reason? Should THEY be calling a policeman? of all the issues they are infuriating about...lambasting Obama for not doing...exactly what he's already doing, always takes the cake And one more thing: Do you get to say \"New Yorkers are garbage people\" if you're a Cuban from Calgary? And by the way, what is a New York value? A studio apartment for $2,500 a month. Value - that's a steal! Cruz to New York: Drop dead. If we didn't have the stupid electoral college, they couldn't write off THIRTY EIGHT STATES! Of course Trump is for arming everyone, he's got the bulletproof hair! \"Isis does not get their guns from gun shows\". True - they get them from the U S military. How many humvees did they capture in Mosul? Yes, when Obama said Rednecks cling to their guns and their religion...way off on that one. Oh Jeb, does Fla. really get to weigh in on guns? The one with the law \"If you make me nervous, I get to shoot you?\" Well, that wasn't so bad. What, there's more? Shit. I'm playing Words with Friends with John Kasich right now! Christie: \"I vetoed a ban on guns that can shoot down airplanes and through the doors of squad cars.\" Applause. Wheres Isis when u need 'em? I've seen productions of Boys in the Band that weren't this bitchy. Man, for a Canadian, Cruz fights nasty like a...well, like an American! Trump to Cruz: \"I'm not bringing a suit, I promise\" - that's what he said to me before he sued me! The crows at the republican debate just booed the Wall St Journal. Welcome to the Bird Sanctuary Thank god, a commercial break. \"Back to more making you shit your pants, after this word from Depends!\" Saying we need to rebuild our military is like saying county fairs need more fried foods I like the audience shots - takes the myth that the Republicans are a bunch of angry old white people...and proves it Christie: \"If i'm president, Hillary won't get within ten miles of the white house\"- great, more bridge closures Love the way they now all say \"Sure, the millionaires are doing great...\" - and when I find the assholes who paved the way for that!... Haha, Cruz made sure he was first to say Obama's a pussy because our sailors got released, on a question about the economy. He's the worst!
