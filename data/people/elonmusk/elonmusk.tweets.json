That would be absurd \u2026 @Tesmanian_com I generally try my best not to be on patents @TimFernholz Efficiently reusable rockets are all that matter for making life multiplanetary &amp; \u201cspace power\u201d. Because their rockets are not reusable, it will become obvious over time that ULA is a complete waste of taxpayer money. @WholeMarsBlog Will be amazing to see it in operation!

H2 is hell. Tesla factory workplace safety is 5% better than industry average for manufacturers &amp; improving fast https://t.co/axmInA9fZb @Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) &amp; significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2. @Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach &gt;99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day &amp; requires desooting of turbines between flights.

Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc. @Erdayastronaut @ElonHarith @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight SLS makes me feel sad @WhatsupFranks @NASASpaceflight No, they will be smashed beyond repair &amp; corroded @flcnhvy @NASASpaceflight Yeah, although hydrogen is not a great choice for a booster engine @ABauerle5 A great mystery of the universe @NASASpaceflight It\u2019s so tragic that these engines just crash into the ocean every flight @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @YoavOffek Roundabouts no problem, but dodging distracted human drivers very tricky! @PPathole @Erdayastronaut @farrier_nyker @GeetPurohit3 @YoavOffek Looks about right. Ice mining/refining  on Mars &amp; maximizing total system efficiency will be hard. CO2 is easy, as Mars atmosphere is mostly that. Also has good amount of N2, which is important for life. @Erdayastronaut @YoavOffek In this case, just chilling the gas back to liquid @Erdayastronaut @farrier_nyker @GeetPurohit3 @YoavOffek Yes, converts CO2 &amp; H2O to CH4 &amp; O2. Perfect for Mars! https://t.co/WF9AGgee12 @Erdayastronaut @YoavOffek Flare stack flamed out.

It wasn\u2019t just that a few people went to the moon, they went there for all humankind. @WhatsupFranks @flcnhvy Another reason reported mortality rate is overstated is that dying *with* covid is not same as dying *from* covid. Media keeps reporting former, not latter. @InSpaceXItrust @jgrano305 Maybe 1.5% change to interior dimensions.

This article incorrectly conflates invasive as \u201cventilator\u201d, but makes many good points https://t.co/5cPQ29wOvu @flcnhvy You\u2019d think they\u2019d at least be Wikipedia-level informed about ventilators! It clearly articulates the difference between invasive &amp; non-invasive. It\u2019s very misleading to the public to claim that only the invasive type are \u201creal ventilators\u201d.\nhttps://t.co/wHkAQ9177V @PPathole @nichegamer My kids loved that one when they were little @nichegamer \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 @SpaceForceDoD @AF_Academy Congratulations again!

This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation &amp; you\u2019re fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable. @flcnhvy @dschless @Bob_Wachter Sounds about right https://t.co/pEPVJi56Vg @dschless @Bob_Wachter Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients?

Even NY is giving them away! @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch @Erdayastronaut @imatsb @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage &amp; payload separation system also not US. @Robotbeat @ghotiing @CruizVinicius @josh119872 @SweetINXS @voteLabonte @Erdayastronaut @Tesla Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips &amp; Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation &amp; setting PEEP &amp; O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage. https://t.co/2IUnS5DPOg @Erdayastronaut @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%. @davidmholtom @Nu23ro @SciGuySpace Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated! @davidmholtom @Nu23ro @SciGuySpace Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!! @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing. @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That\u2019s the acid test. @SciGuySpace True. Only reason other medium &amp; heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they\u2019d be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying. To be clear, Fremont &amp; Shanghai will also be upgraded over time, but it\u2019s hard to retrofit these improvements to an operating paint shop Initial production at Giga Berlin is Model Y @brandonbernicky You will be able to wrap it in any color or pattern @justpaulinelol There\u2019s tough competition for that title, but we will give it our best shot!

Let us know if there\u2019s anything else you need. @justpaulinelol @EvaFoxU @Tesla We expect to have over ~1200 to distribute this week.

Will have our team reach out. RT @Medtronic: Addressing #COVID19 is a group effort. We are grateful for the discussion with @ElonMusk and @Tesla as we work across indust\u2026 Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team! @SamTalksTesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 No problem :) @SamTalksTesla @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe &amp; should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China. @flcnhvy @thirdrowtesla @NateSilver538 Sigmoidal for China, followed by sigmoidal for rest of world @Lauren62515251 @PPathole @NateSilver538 Fair point :) @RiccitelliDylan @ColdBuschLights @PPathole @NateSilver538 Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too. https://t.co/YKMW54q2kL @PPathole @NateSilver538 Up to 80% false positive @PPathole @NateSilver538 Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases &amp; using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand. @NateSilver538 Do you have data on the false positive rate? I\u2019ve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and \u201cpresumed positive\u201d. https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG @NateSilver538 Important consideration @friedberg Feels like the plot of Deus Ex https://t.co/R8tmw048JM @MG42bonesaw A single computer, pump &amp; pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients, but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care &amp; avoid cross-flow risk @RenataKonkoly @moskov Yeah, SpaceX is working on ventilators too @moskov That won\u2019t work for our auto parts suppliers, so, no, our US factory can\u2019t stay open @EdLudlow Yes, we\u2019re working on ventilators, even though I think they probably won\u2019t be needed @alandrummond2 Interesting thread @DOfaquarius @PPathole Thanks \ud83d\udc96 @Cernovich China is operating normally across hundreds of suppliers &amp; all of Tesla Shanghai @DOfaquarius @PPathole We\u2019re working on ventilators, even though I think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter @flcnhvy Anyone feeling even slightly ill should stay home. Elderly should avoid close contact, even with family members, for now. Those seem most important. @RationalEtienne @PPathole https://t.co/eltgA3hrAr @RationalEtienne @PPathole Kids are essentially immune, but elderly with existing conditions are vulnerable. Family gatherings with close contact between kids &amp; grandparents probably most risky. @PPathole Based on current trends, probably close to zero new cases in US too by end of April @PPathole Yes No new domestic corona cases in China https://t.co/lGmxRvMyFy @westcoastbill Imo, this professor is correct. Also, growth rate of confirmed C19 cases is dropping every day, despite 10X increase in testing. From Tues to today, was 43%, 24%, 17%. Track this chart: https://t.co/vZ3PbhQihG @NYCMayor @NateSilver538 Sounds good, we will connect with your team to understand potential needs @M_Mosseri @SpaceX @NASA @NASA_Astronauts Yes @DisruptResearch @Jason True @Jason Exactly. My guess is that the panic will cause more harm than the virus, if that hasn\u2019t happened already. @NateSilver538 Tesla makes cars with sophisticated hvac systems. SpaceX makes spacecraft with life support systems. Ventilators are not difficult, but cannot be produced instantly.

Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production &amp; thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year! @PPathole @JohnHanzl It\u2019s mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites, the front is light &amp; back is heavy due to engines &amp; landing legs. @JohnHanzl Sorry, meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose. CH4 main tank is above LOX main. @JohnHanzl LOX @SciGuySpace These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations. @SciGuySpace Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full &amp; rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.

It will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine. @PPathole @Erdayastronaut Header tanks are only ~2% of main tank volume, so not a big deal.

Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It\u2019s stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don\u2019t do it justice. @brittanygayle98 Its integrated roof &amp; solar, so should be light enough for almost any home @dafuq_mac Coming hopefully later this year @TarunBhatt161 I think will still be better than a normal roof, but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice &amp; snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows! @Emmonstein No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, it\u2019s very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles. @_mantis_ Sounds should note that it gets less shiny automatically due to dust &amp; weathering.

Was a fun recruiting event. Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships. @Teslarati @13ericralph31 Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be &lt;2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter. @nextspaceflight @chraveesh @Teslarati No, they\u2019re SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time. @chraveesh @Teslarati Yes, we\u2019re tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering &amp; building a heavy duty planisher to flatten &amp; cold work the weld area @Teslarati That said, although substantial capital &amp; engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it\u2019s built inside a factory in volume. @Teslarati This isn\u2019t quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that\u2019s 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures &amp; welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving.

Also, tons of C++/C engineers needed for vehicle control &amp; entire rest of car. Educational background is irrelevant, but all must pass hardcore coding test. @CathieDWood @ARKInvest The profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array, which is already in some humans &amp; has severe drawbacks. @TheReal_Psyche Sorry! @SamTalksTesla A PhD is definitely not required.

Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity. @SPEXcast @SciGuySpace Densification isn\u2019t needed to return the ship &amp; limited cargo from Mars, but it\u2019s an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed @SciGuySpace Fundamental issue with SLS is that it\u2019s not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch! \ud83d\udcaf tragedy. @SciGuySpace Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2.

There is sooo much solar energy. We can solar power all of human civilization with a tiny % of Earth\u2019s surface, which is a super tiny % of energy emitted by the sun. @Alejandro_DebH @macshlibber @SpaceflightNow Advancing humanity\u2019s understanding of the Universe is a fundamental motivator for SpaceX!

Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don\u2019t collapse when depressurized on the ground. @Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4. @Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps &amp; pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls @Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight.

A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important. @SmileSimplify @Erdayastronaut Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc &amp; steel melt pool. @Erdayastronaut No, will be autogenous from the start, tapping hot CH4 &amp; O2 from Raptor @teslaownersSV @TonyCrisostomo @Erdayastronaut Yeah @Erdayastronaut Best would probably be an autogenous laser weld, but we need more precise parts &amp; fixtures. Hopefully get that done in 2020. @Erdayastronaut Almost everything is different. These parts are stamped vs manually bump-formed &amp; TIP TIG welded vs flux core. Higher precision, stronger joints &amp; 20% mass reduction. @DJSnM We use that process for the Raptor nozzle jacket. The knuckles of this dome are stamped in Michigan with a 4000 ton car body press, which costs much less for same outcome. Almost three now. Boca team is crushing it!

The objective reality for large cities worldwide is that efforts to solve traffic have not worked well. If we don\u2019t try *something* new, we will be in traffic hell forever. @JonAttenborough @cFidd Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else &amp; directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them. @ollie_turrell @cFidd Pretty much @Snipergen @Tesla Sure. Trax will get much better &amp; more fun. This is an alpha version. @cFidd No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic &amp; it\u2019s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is. @RationalEtienne @EvaFoxU @amargosavalley That might have something to do with it. \u201cStalin: Court of the Red Tsar\u201d was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading.

Probably wouldn\u2019t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force! @jchybow @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Pretty much @leo_cadle @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Exactly! It\u2019s also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far). @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That\u2019s the sales pitch. Want to go? @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy As the planets align only once every two years @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city @Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what\u2019s hard. @flcnhvy Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half @flcnhvy If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that\u2019s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year @flcnhvy Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it\u2019s designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year @flcnhvy The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars @cleantechnica Gas/diesel cars too @cleantechnica True Extremism is so fun!

It\u2019s the Air Force. @WillFealey @Teslarati Fair point. Coming soon. We\u2019re making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. 2FA right after that. @Teslarati Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software. @cleantechnica More to come @bob_burrough Yes @rafaelcr @OfWudan Would be odd to expect anything else @TJ_Cooney That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth @TJ_Cooney Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed. @flcnhvy Great poem Great work by SpaceX Dragon team &amp; Airborne! To be clear, we\u2019ve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row. https://t.co/Q814zVoW4S @Teslarati Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range.

Also, there\u2019s a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by 50HP, so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in 0 to 60 &amp; 1/4 mile races. @TeslaNY Walking on a Tesla Solarglass roof is definitely no problem!

Glass doesn\u2019t burn &amp; melting point is extremely high, so much more resilient than asphalt or wood roofs. @realDiegoMonroy I hate advertising Unfortunately, it\u2019s hard to google Tesla solar links due to tons of ads &amp; SEO. Go to https://t.co/UvQa8JOE7v to add solar to an existing roof &amp; https://t.co/D9yUuL7NVE for a new roof with integrated solar. We don\u2019t make much money on this product, so $1000 actually means a lot If you\u2019re directly affected by wildfire power outages, Tesla is reducing Solar+Powerwall prices by $1000 as of today Apologies to those waiting for Solar/Powerwall outside California, as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires @jasondunn So true. Imagine if phones were gasoline powered. Total sales would be like 14 units worldwide! Using oil/gas &amp; being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the future! Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow. Adding a Powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important. \nhttps://t.co/3y4M5L50qF @flcnhvy @teslaownersSV I\u2019d recommend regular solar panels for flat roofs @starshipsara Extremely high @teslaownersSV Will do what we can for anyplace affected by natural disasters US clean energy incentive drops by 4% on Jan 1, so orders must be received by roughly Nov 15 to be installed in time Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery backup for 24/7 clean energy &amp; no blackouts at https://t.co/mDoPO17YB9 @SnazzyQ @Tesla Sure @flcnhvy https://t.co/40NtMONR72 Took my son to play piano for the seniors home in Pasadena.

Don\u2019t need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower. @nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Also, we\u2019re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that\u2019s leaving a lot on the table @nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec. @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now. @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2. https://t.co/LijrUMuJDq @torybruno @Erdayastronaut @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne This is true. All that matters is number used in \u2206v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass. https://t.co/s2LcEapGAU @HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen &amp; oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters. @teslaownersSV @Sofiaan @annerajb @tesla_addicted We\u2019re working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren\u2019t actual parking spaces. @Sofiaan @annerajb @tesla_addicted Yeah, great team! @J_ump_er @neiltyson @Space_Station To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth. https://t.co/21hICWczMq @HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere."}
