It was on full display at the #RNC2020. https://t.co/SnFj91tAwD Trump says he will \"protect patients with pre-existing conditions, and that is a pledge from the entire Republican Party\" at the #RNC2020. But it\u2019s already guaranteed by the Affordable Care Act. https://t.co/k0QYfNgW1C In his #RNC2020 speech, Trump attacked Joe Biden's planned response to the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s campaign has essentially pretended there is no pandemic \u2014 both at the RNC and in ad campaigns. https://t.co/FK4DBC722I Outgoing White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said that the situation is a boost for President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection prospects. \u201cThe more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is\u2026\u201d she said. https://t.co/N7BSOC7bFe President Trump continues law-and-order attacks on the Democratic ticket at #RNC2020 and mentions the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which has led to unrest. https://t.co/G4VvS4hF6z The president has dealt inconsistently with the question of whether federal or local authorities bear responsibility for crime, blaming Obama for spikes in violence in 2016 but now calling the current rise in crime a failure of Democratic city officials. https://t.co/VBRwAtlav6 The anti-racist protests have persisted in many U.S. cities and remained largely peaceful, but the Trump administration\u2019s response has been anything but. https://t.co/cTIHzepcsy Since the start of the George Floyd prootests, cities across the country have seen an alarming spike in violent crime. @RottenInDenmark found that while the increase in crime is real, there is no evidence to suggest protests are to blame. https://t.co/tmKNgQklCb Trump stokes fears about crime in cities at #RNC2020. Crime rates actually decreased over the past decade, and while there\u2019s been an increase in violent crime in recent months, it\u2019s unlikely to reverse the historic downward trend in crime rates. https://t.co/H1ZCAcxl2u Trump repeats a line from his vice president\u2019s #RNC2020 speech last night that people \u201cwon\u2019t be safe in Joe Biden\u2019s America,\u201d Biden responded to this comment today. https://t.co/ZoylVuhdJT https://t.co/V1jRh2ttbk Trump says Biden is a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d for socialism. In reality, the Trump campaign has struggled to define Biden-Harris, portraying them as far-left socialists \u2014 a claim that's ridiculous to actual socialists. #RNC2020 https://t.co/NnPBkFmSae As described in this June article, Trump also used the coronavirus pandemic to justify a crackdown on immigration that puts vulnerable migrants \u2014 including children \u2014 at risk and separates families. https://t.co/5lQ5aw6Dez He has also fought to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that Biden supports. Although the Supreme Court ruled against ending the program in June, the president has said he will try again. https://t.co/ceMibxGkEj In comparison, President Trump has raised the barriers to legal immigration \u2015 nearly doubling the fees for a number of immigration and work authorization applications, including the fee to apply for naturalization. https://t.co/6WPjYyaaMK At #RNC2020, Trump incorrectly states there will be open borders and deadly sanctuary cities under a Biden administration. While the Democratic nominee does support a path to citizenship for Dreamers, there is no mention of open borders in his platform. Just over 1 million Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, a sign that the coronavirus outbreak continues to threaten jobs. https://t.co/mKfVEyjs4G The president has claimed that the economy is \u201croaring back.\u201d Yet more Americans are currently unemployed than at any point since World War II, according to this June 2020 article. https://t.co/LNAH7gcLmR It may seem counterintuitive that the stock market could flourish during a deadly outbreak that\u2019s shuttering local economies around the country and, in turn, forcing the U.S. unemployment rate to hover above 10 percent. Trump raves about the stock market recovery in his #RNC2020 speech. The actual economy is faring much worse. https://t.co/GnJUt80mlR Trump says his administration is \"focusing on the science, the facts and the data\" on COVID-19.

Public health experts and political leaders around the world have sharply criticized this. https://t.co/d9cPC3VIQq Now, as the coronavirus death toll approaches 200,000 and nearly 6 million cases in the United States, the Trump administration is desperate for a win. https://t.co/l6vGsxlRDL As coronavirus infections continue to surge nationwide, Trump has repeatedly made an unsubstantiated claim that the pathogen will simply \u201cdisappear\u201d one day. In July, Trump claimed, \"I'll be right eventually.\" https://t.co/upbxDo21TQ Trump lists what his administration has done since COVID-19 hit.

In July, his administration has overturned a rule intended to fight racial segregation. https://t.co/AydE6cu44i Trump brought up fixing the immigration system in his #RNC2020 address. The president\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy has stranded asylum-seekers. Parents are sending their children to cross the border alone, not knowing if they will reunite. https://t.co/Y00P9glIyg Trump addresses the border wall and immigration in his #RNC2020 speech. What started as a series of small, obscure administrative changes is resulting in unthinkable cruelty. https://t.co/ZLCXB5JQAl Four years ago, Trump promised a 2,000-mile \u201cGreat Wall\u201d made of reinforced concrete and paid for by Mexico. \u201cI would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I\u2019ll build them very inexpensively,\u201d Trump said. https://t.co/DG3rHUDNOC In his #RNC2020 speech, Trump says 300 miles of steel fence have been built on the U.S.-Mexico border and that close to 500 would be finished by the end of the year. In fact, only three of those 212 miles are along parts of the border that previously had no barrier. As Trump brags about his trade deals at #RNC2020, it\u2019s important to also note the negative impacts of his trade war. This January article explains how it hit farmers. https://t.co/To8w2k07KU During #RNC2020, Trump tells victims of Hurricane Laura that the government will be there for them. As historic wildfires rage in blue California, he has threatened to withhold federal relief funds \u2014 highlighting huge disparities in disaster response. https://t.co/OZK9j8eIY4 The first daughter was criticized last month for being outrageously out of touch when she suggested millions of Americans who have lost their jobs amid the COVID-19 crisis simply look elsewhere for work as part of her Find Something New Campaign. #RNC2020 https://t.co/N78A0FTgez Earlier this week, Pam Bondi accused Joe and Hunter Biden of nepotism even as Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner serve as senior advisers and sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. profit from U.S. business ventures around the world. #RNC2020 https://t.co/XBCfBCl3Oy Her siblings, who spoke earlier this week \u2014 Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump \u2014 weren\u2019t given the same courtesy title in the convention schedule. #RNC2020 https://t.co/zAZ9q6ZmmB Ivanka Trump speaks at the #RNC2020. The President\u2019s daughter was given the confounding title \u201cThe Honorable\u201d Ivanka Trump when the list of speakers was first released. Such a title is usually reserved for judges and high-ranking officials. In an essay soon after her release, @_Jahan wrote, \u201cWe can celebrate the release of Alice Marie Johnson without ignoring the fact that the man who released her is subjecting swaths of others to her plight.\u201d  https://t.co/JzdjXBDTY3 Alice Johnson speaks at #RNC2020. Trump granted Johnson clemency in June 2018 after reality star Kim Kardashian spoke with the president about prison reform and sentencing. Johnson was serving a life sentence for a first-time, nonviolent drug offense. https://t.co/7bSvm6TepQ Trump needs to stick to a script at the #RNC2020 to persuade voters he\u2019s not the person they\u2019ve seen in action over three years. Critics are skeptical he can pull it off. https://t.co/HM7hRQMejs Giuliani says anti-police protests are causing more crime. But it\u2019s bad policing that stops people from calling the cops. @RottenInDenmark\u2019s article in July sheds light on that. #RNC2020 https://t.co/5qvPSeKFcp Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney, claims Black Lives Matter is part of an organized anarchist network that wants to \u201cdestroy\u201d the U.S. government.
