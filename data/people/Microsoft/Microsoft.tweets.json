We will provide $20M of financing to existing and new partners to support their cashflow needs. A new $50M partner fund will help with access to capital providing loans to support these partners through their startup phase with the loans recovered over time as their business grows. We look forward to investing to increase the number of Black- and African American-owned partners in our US partner community by 20 percent over the next three years. We have started by establishing an investment fund with an initial $25M investment with Siebert Williams Shank &amp; Co LLC (SWS), the nation\u2019s premier woman-owned and minority-owned investment bank: https://t.co/DAKrU7ZeLf We will establish a $50M investment fund focused on supporting Black- and African American-owned small businesses. We will create a $100M program that will make its initial investment in collaboration with the FDIC to target Minority Owned Depository Institutions (MDIs), which directly enables an increase of funds into local communities (businesses, restaurants, housing, etc.). We will use our own banking needs to grow our portfolio investment activity with Black- and African American-owned financial institutions. We will double the number of Black- and African American-owned approved suppliers over the next three years and spend an incremental $500M with those existing and new suppliers. We will evolve our engagement with our supply chain, banking partners, and the broad Microsoft partner ecosystem in the effort to address racial injustice. A vast business ecosystem surrounds Microsoft from our supply chain to our partner community. We recognize that a stronger and more productive ecosystem requires better representation of the diversity in our communities. In our June announcement, CEO @satyanadella spoke about engaging our ecosystems to address racial injustice. Here\u2019s a thread on what that means \u2b07\ufe0f We continue to be committed to addressing racial injustice: https://t.co/TlR6Yl5xNI It starts with each of us making a commitment to do the work, to help drive change and to act with intention. Our commitment to addressing racial injustice is not a one-time event. We will adapt, take feedback and get better. This will require systemic change and enduring focus. The world demands this change. Our customers and partners expect this change from Microsoft. Our employees expect this change from their leaders and from each other. Change begins by looking inward. We expect this change in ourselves. We're appalled at the latest violence towards the Black and African American community and will continue to use our platform to address racial injustice. #MicrosoftTeams has the tools educators and parents will need as they prepare for the new virtual #school year.\n\nGet started: https://t.co/ZAblRl5s36 In the latest episode of #PeopleTalk with our Chief People Officer Kathleen Hogan, learn why @ariannahuff is optimistic about the future of work. https://t.co/YNiWcJfBi0 .@mindaustralia is undergoing a digital transformation to streamline the delivery of #MentalHealth services and provide deeper insights to support clients. \n\nDiscover how: https://t.co/rSg47eTr3c RT @XboxWire: The August 2020 Xbox One Update is here for everyone, making it easier to connect with your friends.
