If you bully others (ranging from just being a dick to hate crimes) then just stop and reconsider. #ifirstknewIwasLGBTQ when I went and saw Star Trek: Into Darkness on a friend date with the attractive guy friend in my group and enjoyed the date along with the fact that Sulu was gay in it. So apparently my mental breakdowns need a social media platform to explode on or whatever because this last one was in the comments of YouTube videos...\n\nso we did what we always do, delete them and move on We Stan the internet fighting the bad people.\n\nIt gives me hope and helps with the anxiety. We Stan the subtle homophobia from straight men on the internet...\n\n(this is sarcasm btw - in the words of Dua Lipa - in case you need it mansplained) @dawismusic Happy birthday Luke!!!!

I'm genuinely confused why white people were so adamant against black people in the 1960s (and all other times in history, but this idea stemmed from reading about this) when it literally doesn't even have any negative effect on their (our) privelege Bro types of straight men scare me... but I\u2019m prepared to frighten them with my raging homosexuality because their afraid of the gay Getting ready to bond with my coworkers over the great internet outage that is not letting us work at 5 am The day I figured out that my work lets me kindly tell people they are being mean with their language was the best day I'm proud that my attempts to use more gender-neutral language has become far easier and has rubbed off on my family This was genuinely cool.

Science is kinda crazy ngl. I have a conspiracy theory that the reason I didn't make it to state solo and ensemble in choir my senior year is I picked a song that was 7 minutes long. The actual relief when you look at a IsOverParty tag on someone you admire and people are there being like \"guys, this is actually too far\"\n\nOnly when it actually was, like jokes and other things that need context.

Watch me use Cooper Anderson's acting advice from Glee in the real world Watching Glee made me realize how blessed I was in high-school.

Ok we\u2019re all good. I can dismiss this in my compartmentalized mind. Ah her recent posts are so icky! I\u2019m so disheartened. What should I do? Also this lady who\u2019s my neighbor just shared a thing saying that positive test results might be from having some similar antibodies to COVID and I want to say, \u201cso.\u201d Because I don\u2019t see how that proves any point.

Are you happy Twitter?! I\u2019ve been thinking about the power of theatre as an art form as a way that creatives cope with tragedies or historical events that are quite intense and I think it\u2019s so cool. Every Wikipedia article I\u2019ve read about some big tragedy has theatre under its popular culture category. @Christi58186388 Omg Christina, not you, you're fabulous! Just literally, everyone, we graduated with who is ALREADY GETTING MARRIED! Do other gays think about how much the opposite sex might be attracted to them? What if I start a series of lessons about how to respond to posts and tweets in a way that isn't absolutely pointless.\n\nLike lesson 1: you don't have to comment on a post saying \"why did I see this\" unless your friend posted a nude picture on Facebook or the like Is it bad that I fantasize about some homophobe or some bully in the future when I'm an educator who I get to tell to knock it off?\n\nOr have I just been watching too much Glee? I can't wait to find love and prove to everyone I graduated with who is getting married that I could be happier and more fabulous than them. I'm gonna start to tweet ambiguously in the first tweet of threads so someone will make an article with it and use my first tweet as the Snapchat and thumbnail What if we in the world did the \"ouch\" \"oops\" thing that all those theatres in Chicago did? Will Schuester is a whore We love when you get a group email from work saying you need to improve, and then a follow-up email from your manager saying, \"except you, you're doing great\"\n\nThis is feeding my already very big ego. Be proud of me: I reported some dumbass's https://t.co/KyktLMdERX petition that was full of misinformation, with a supporting article! Why I felt it was fecked up that some guy put funny a serious scene from a cop drama about school shootings; those kids in the comments scared me https://t.co/radVObBoVj Hi everyone, this is a social media rule I've set for myself:\n\nI only engage in negative posts that are blatantly racist, homophobic, or targeting others/bullying or have messages that can influence others in an extremely negative way (making fun of school shootings/petitions) Why did America decide masks needed to be a political issue and to conspiracy theorize about it when it's harmful to not wear one? Update: I just told the person I snoozed that their petition to make masks NOT mandatory for schools was anti-vax level dangerous and unfounded so...\n\nhere's to possibly losing some dumbass on Facebook as a friend The Snooze for 30 days option on Facebook is my version of giving people on Facebook a time out for the stupid s#!t they say. can someone tell me it's ok that i email my professors who are trying to figure out this online stuff with feedback when things go a bit wrong very, every is also hilarious if being a decent non-hating person was difficult, then why would so many people do it? sometimes i think i might be straight/bisexual and then i see a gorgeous man and my brain reminds me saying \"hey adam, remember you're every gay\" i tried that name + color aesthetic facebook thing and all i found was vibrators I might just be an English minor but the etymology of words makes so much fecking sense RT @iashmcknight: I'm pissed at all of you selfish pricks who made it so now my education and career are at risk.

I'm mad I missed the protests, but I'm here I would like to reiterate that this isn't about me. These are my thoughts.

I'm trying to convince this boy I've been talking to on @hinge to get Animal Crossing so we can go on a date in the game because I'm lonely...\n\nand I'm now prepared to spend hours of my life to impress him with my island so I need tips. :) Hey @DevonOltmanns, Thank you for the follow!

Hey @KirtlanM, Thank you for the follow! Hey theatre community\nThis is your moment. I'm listening to new musicals while doing homework. I'm running out on the list I made. I, of course, can't list what I've already listened to but think of more obscure musicals, but even some popular ones I might've skipped over.\nThanks I'm too good at essay titles https://t.co/Wlzv02eltg I've never related more to the \"in the workplace, being gay just has its perks\" meme more in my life.

I think I just slipped an innuendo underneath my family...\n\nI think my uncle might have gotten it. My censorship skills are on point while playing JackBox with my family I want to be the textbook author who thought of saying that Titanic the Musical \"sailed off with five Tonys.\" Whoever tried to hack my Spotify...\n\nHave any music recommendations? Yo, can we all learn how grammar works during this quarantine? Thank you. What if I find a boyfriend using Animal Crossing? I'm too invested into Animal Crossing so I'm having anxiety over not getting the Cherry-Blossom recipes I definitely got too upset figuring out that planting Bell Trees in Animal Crossing: New Horizons is gambling and not investing A girl online from the southern hemisphere in Animal Crossing might be flirting with me and I'm too gay to know if she is and I'm scared. I have too many opinions for the internet to handle It's so weird to watch this Broadway documentary because it's so concerned about the theatre being popular and about @WICKED_Musical and stuff and now it's 2020 and we love theatre!\n\nI'm just saying I liked theatre before y'all thought it was cool. I'm watching a Broadway documentary and I started crying so that's my mental state.

I forced my friend to not let me have the code to some clothes she designed for me in Animal Crossing until I finish my homework. Hey update time: I'm feeling so much better. Sometimes anxieties about the world tend to excite all the other possibilities, plus I've been alone with my thoughts for too long. So that technically means I need to play more Animal Crossing or else I'll explode. @CoryThomps The small things. Hey @aldafffodil, Thank you for the follow!
