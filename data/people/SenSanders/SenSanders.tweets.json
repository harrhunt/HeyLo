Today we remember the nearly 3,000 lives lost on 9/11 and the brave people who risked their lives to help that day. Those selfless acts of sacrifice show the very best of us as a nation, and we can honor that sacrifice by working to build a world of security and dignity for all.

During this public health crisis, the Senate must also pass legislation to empower Medicare to pay all of the medical bills of the uninsured and the under-insured\u2014including prescription drugs\u2014for the duration of the pandemic. The American people cannot afford to wait another month. Here is what we must do: \n\nIn order to avoid another Great Depression, the Senate must pass legislation requiring the government to guarantee 100 percent of the paychecks and benefits of American workers up to $90,000/year. Our most vulnerable communities are hungry, desperate and under enormous emotional stress. It is incomprehensible for Senator Mitch McConnell to tell us that he sees no urgency in passing another emergency relief bill and that he wants to wait another month before taking action. What gives me hope right now are the new generations of young people who dream big and do not want to settle for the status quo. In the midst of a pandemic, health workers can't find basic equipment. We are forced to import:\n\n90% of our surgical masks\n70% of respirators\n90% pharmaceutical ingredients\n\nCorporate trade destroyed our manufacturing base. We must start producing our medical supplies at home. https://t.co/zrWwWT2Xdr A great nation is not judged by its number of billionaires or corporate tax breaks. It's judged by how we treat our most vulnerable people.

We should be bailing out the working families of this country, not the wealthy oil and coal companies. https://t.co/G3dGRmtMt7 Internet access is a necessity, not a luxury.

In my view, one additional $1,200 check is not enough. The Senate must provide a $2,000 per month emergency payment for every American until this crisis is over. Second: Any legislation in the Senate to address the economic crisis must include a provision to guarantee 100 percent of the paychecks of workers up to $90,000 a year. This is what is being done successfully in many European countries and what should be done here. First: Instead of subsidizing COBRA \u2014 which would be a massive giveaway to the health insurance industry \u2014 I believe Medicare must be empowered to pay all of the health care bills of the uninsured and under-insured until this crisis is over.

That is why they gave the exclusive power over war and peace to the people\u2019s elected representatives. I will do everything that I can as a United States Senator to prevent such a war. Let\u2019s be clear: another war in the Middle East could cost countless lives and trillions more dollars and lead to even more deaths, more conflict, more displacement in that already highly volatile region of the world. The Iraq war led to the deaths of 4,500 U.S. troops, and the wounding of tens of thousands. It led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, and the displacement of over 5 million people.\n\nAnd after all that, the Iraqi parliament voted last week to boot U.S. forces out. In terms of Iraq, we were told that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, that he was working with Al Qaeda, and that we needed to invade Iraq unless we wanted to see another 9/11, or even worse, a nuclear attack.\n\nThose claims were lies. The result: the war in Vietnam cost us 59,000 American deaths and many others who came home wounded in body and spirit. In fact, a whole generation was devastated by that war. The casualties in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia are almost incalculable. When I look back upon American history I remember the two most significant foreign policy mistakes our country made in the modern era, and those are the war in Vietnam and the war in Iraq. And let us be clear, we were led into both of those wars by a series of lies.

And Trump spends most of his time talking about a wall. It's time for a real change. In the richest country in the world, our teachers should be the best-paid, not among the worst-paid. I stand with Denver teachers. We must invest in public education because our students and teachers deserve better. #DenverTeacherStrike 75 years ago, FDR talked about the need to guarantee every person in this country a good job as a fundamental right. That was true in 1944. It is true today. Trump gave the top 1% and large corporations $1 trillion in tax breaks.  Now, he wants to repeal the Estate Tax and make his billionaire friends even richer. Wrong! At a time of massive wealth inequality, the very rich must pay their fair share of taxes. We can no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that have been rigged to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else. Trump is worried about America becoming a \"socialist nation.\" That is exactly what Republicans said about Social Security in 1935 and what they said about Medicare in 1965. Guess what? These are the two most popular programs in the country. What if, instead giving tax breaks to billionaires and massive corporations, we gave 40 million Americans a raise by making the federal minimum wage a living wage of $15 an hour? Donald Trump rants against undocumented immigrants, and wants to spend billions on a wall to keep them out. Yet, surprise, surprise. Trump's golf clubs and resorts have knowingly hired low-wage undocumented workers for years. What a fraud!

Workers deserve severance pay and to have their benefits honored. https://t.co/x4mMXk7liD Fighting for Medicare for all will mean taking on special interests who will spend enormous sums of money to defend our dysfunctional health care system. They have the money. We have the people. The American people are tired of a health care system that works for Wall Street investors, insurance companies and the pharmaceutical industry\u2014but ignores their needs. They want to move to a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system. President Trump believes we should listen to fossil fuel executives and ignore climate change. \n\nI believe we should listen to the scientists who tell us we must aggressively combat climate change and transform our energy system to sustainable energy. Where did the money from Trump's \"tax cuts for the middle class\" go? To wealthy corporations who have spent $1 trillion buying back their own stock to enrich executives and wealthy shareholders. That's not acceptable. https://t.co/tsOvYYRekZ Republicans want to cut taxes for Trump's kids and other children of billionaire families.

We can raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Yes, the economy is great\u2014for the top 1 percent, who now earn 46 percent of all new income.

Two cents. Every other major country has made the morally principled and financially responsible decision to make health care a right to all of their people. Those who say this goal is unachievable are selling the American people short. Gov. Northam should resign. Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax should step in and begin a new day for Virginia.

We cannot have a vibrant democracy or a just economy when so few have so much, and so many have so little.

Or will we continue to allow insurance and pharma companies to make huge profits off of people's suffering? I do not believe that men and women fought and died for our right to vote so that billionaires could buy elections. We must move to real campaign finance reform and public funding of elections. In the year 2019, no one in America, especially those working for profitable corporations with billionaire CEOs, should be living in poverty or struggling economically.\n\nWe must raise the minimum wage to a living wage\u2014$15 an hour. Mr. President. 800,000 federal employees and their families are human beings, not your play things. Do not treat them with contempt and disrupt their lives. They have kids. They have needs. Do not shut down the government again. Our infrastructure is crumbling. Instead of building a wall on the Mexican border, we should create millions of good-paying jobs rebuilding our roads, bridges, water systems, wastewater plants, schools, airports and affordable housing. When an undocumented person commits a murder, Trump talks about it incessantly. When, in 2017,  a white guy like Stephen Paddock kills 58 people in Las Vegas and wounds 851, Trump has very little to say.

Let us end this shutdown and bring the American people together around an agenda that will improve life for all of our people. #BernieResponds https://t.co/2aM2qTvp8w Tonight I will deliver a live response to President Trump's Oval Office address, immediately following Sen. Schumer and Rep. Pelosi's response. Tune in here: \nhttps://t.co/GDd8c2juru https://t.co/J4t1hVXR5A Democrats must block any legislation that does not reopen the government. It is absolutely absurd that the first Senate legislation during the shutdown is a bill which punishes Americans who exercise their constitutional right to engage in political activity. https://t.co/MT8as5oOrf Trump's reckless shutdown is threatening the livelihoods of some 800,000 federal workers. Mr. President: Enough is enough. Federal workers must be paid and the government must reopen. https://t.co/0pgB1GKHY3 97% of Americans support comprehensive background checks. It's time for Republicans in Congress to listen to the American people and stop simply obeying the dictates of the NRA. \n\nWe need to pass common sense gun safety legislation now. https://t.co/Omb4mZBcgd We do not need to waste billions on an unneeded wall so that Trump can appease right-wing extremists.\n\nWe need to create millions of good-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure \u2014 roads, bridges, water systems, rail and affordable housing. The fight for Medicare for all will be opposed by all of the special interests\u2014drug companies, insurance companies, Wall Street\u2014who make billions from our dysfunctional health care system.\n\nThey may have the money. But we have the people.\nhttps://t.co/DWNpsmQt9p There is no border crisis. The real crisis is that 800,000 people don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll pay their mortgages, pay student loans, put gas in their cars or put food on the table because of Donald Trump\u2019s government shutdown. https://t.co/K7L52eIj1w As a result of Trump's shutdown, 800,000 federal employees are in danger of not receiving a paycheck.\n\nThey're worried about how they'll pay their mortgages, feed their families and put gas in their cars.\n\nUnbelievably, Republican leader Mitch McConnell refuses to take action. The U.S. has the world's largest economy. Yet, we lag far behind many other developed countries in health care, life expectancy, infant mortality, poverty, education and infrastructure.  We need a government that works for all, not just the 1%. https://t.co/cLtvP5zQOR Jimmy Carter was right when he said that America is \"an oligarchy, with unlimited political bribery.\"\n\nEvery day we are sliding further away from democracy into an oligarchic form of government. \n\nDemocracy should be about one person, one vote\u2014not billionaires buying elections. Sen. Van Hollen is absolutely right. We should block consideration of all bills on the Senate floor until we end the Trump shutdown and reopen the federal government. https://t.co/SngteGNDrL It\u2019s absurd that the first bill during the shutdown is legislation which punishes Americans who exercise their constitutional right to engage in political activity. Democrats must block consideration of any bills that don\u2019t reopen the government.

Pay federal employees. https://t.co/rHm3gpmPMz As a result of Trump's government shutdown, many federal employees will be unable to pay their mortgages or feed their kids. The Senate's first act must be to re-open the government.  \n\nLeader McConnell: Let the Senate vote on the House bills to re-open the government. The business model of Wall Street is fraud. When the 6 largest American banks have $10 trillion in assets, equivalent to 54% of our GDP, it's time to break them up. We need banks which invest in the real economy and create jobs, not rip us off.  https://t.co/p6m1ceBA5t If President Trump is really concerned about national security then why isn't he paying employees at the FBI, TSA and other security agencies who work every day to protect this country? \n\nPresident Trump. End your shutdown of the government. Pay federal employees. President Trump, federal employees are not billionaires. They have to feed their kids and pay their mortgages. End the shutdown now and treat federal employees with the respect they are due. Congratulations to Republican Senators Cory Gardner and Susan Collins for understanding that 800,000 federal employees must be paid. If Leader McConnell allows the Senate to vote, we can end the government shut down now. Rep. Liz Cheney, daughter of Dick Cheney, yesterday attacked \"the fraud of socialism.\" Really? I wasn't aware that it was \"socialism\" that lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and got us into a horrific war that we should never have started. Is it \"radical\" to demand that all Americans have health care, that billionaires pay their fair share of taxes, that workers earn at least $15 an hour and that we transform our energy system in order to combat climate change? I don't think so. I want to congratulate the House for holding hearings for the first time on Medicare for all. I\u2019m confident the results will show that Medicare for all is the way forward if we want to guarantee heath care to all people in a cost-effective way. https://t.co/frNh3rBPmw At a time when climate change threatens our planet, when our infrastructure is crumbling, when 30 million people have no health insurance, I'm concerned that the concept of PAYGO will make it harder for Congress to address the many crises facing our working families. Trump is a pathological liar. How can we develop rational public policy when we have a president who doesn't know the difference between truth and falsehood? Not a good situation for the most powerful nation on Earth. https://t.co/VVluA4R0v1 Health care is a right, not a privilege. We need Medicare for All so we can end the disgrace of 30 million Americans having no health insurance, and many more being underinsured with high deductibles and co-payments. Our job: pursue a bold agenda that transforms our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. \n\nWe're at war with climate change and, for the sake of our kids and grandchildren, we cannot lose. We must look at climate change as if it were a devastating military attack against the United States and the entire planet. And we must respond accordingly. As 2018 comes to an end, Jane and I want to wish all of you a happy New Year's Eve and a healthy and wonderful new year. Mr. President. Two children are dead because of your immigration policies. For once, be an adult. Stop blaming everyone else. Take responsibility for your actions. https://t.co/e1wkBkERAS Congratulations to Chuck Todd and Meet the Press for holding a serious discussion about climate change.  Will this be a breakthrough moment for mainstream TV, which rarely discusses this issue? https://t.co/CDZ3xHw8Tj The fossil fuel industry is now the equivalent of the tobacco industry. It creates death and destruction, and then spends billions denying its responsibility.\n\nWe must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels and into energy efficiency and sustainable energy. One of the great crises facing our democracy is power of the billionaire class over our political process. The needs of ordinary people are ignored when the very rich and their Super PACs buy elections. We need to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections. If it is just \"bi-partisan politics\" to spend some $700 billion a year on the military, more than the next ten nations combined, why is it a \"radical\" idea to lower student debt and make public colleges and universities tuition-free? The extraordinary power of the corporate establishment is not just over our economy and political life, it is over our imagination and our ability to envision a different kind of world. The American people are tired of a president who is a liar, a fraud, a narcissist and a bully. They want leadership which unites us, not divides us. They want policies which work for all, not just the wealthy few. As we enter the new year let us not forget that while the very rich become much richer, millions of Americans are unable to afford health care, housing, prescription drugs or education. In 2019 we can do better. We must do better. There will no real social progress in this country unless we have the courage to take on Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the military-industrial complex, the fossil fuel industry, the prison industry and all the other forces of greed. The six largest banks now have over $10 trillion in assets\u201454% of GDP. We must break up these huge financial institutions. If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. As we celebrate Christmas and the holiday season, let us rededicate ourselves to a world of peace - and economic, social, racial and environmental justice. Jane and I want to take this opportunity to wish everyone a very Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season. While Trump talks about a \"booming economy,\" the reality for working families is:\n-Real wages for average workers are lower than in 1973\n-80% live paycheck to paycheck\n-Half of older Americans have no retirement savings\nNew Year\u2019s Resolution: Create an economy that works for all. Today, over 40 million Americans live in poverty - including millions of children and seniors.  As we enter the holiday season, and think about the future of our country, let us not forget the biblical admonishment: \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\" Wealth inequality is a profound moral issue this country must address. The richest 3 Americans cannot continue owning more wealth than the bottom half of our country, while over 40% cannot afford the basics to live. We must end the growing concentration of ownership in agribusiness and fight to preserve and strengthen family based agriculture. The American people deserve high quality, locally grown food. https://t.co/TmBFfbFE7m This is what Christmas season looks like in Trumpland:\n-Take away paychecks of 800,000 workers by shutting the government.\n-Take away $1.40 meals from 755,000 hungry, unemployed Americans.\n- Give Pfizer a $26.5 billion tax cut after it increased the price of life saving drugs. This president\u2019s erratic and impulsive behavior is a danger to our country and a major impediment in terms of addressing the crises we face. His decision to shut down the government is just the latest example of this destructive pattern. https://t.co/02kkmG3cHU Think about it for a minute.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans come together, after a whole lot of debate, and agree on how to keep the government open.\n\nAnd then, after a day of right-wing media criticism, the president undermines all of that. To say the least, that is problematic. Trump's decision to shut down the government is just the latest example of a destructive pattern. The time is long overdue for congressional Republicans to stand up to him. https://t.co/9KFRGWgatc \"I am proud to shut down the government...  I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I\u2019m not going to blame you for it.\" \u2013@realDonaldTrump, last Tuesday https://t.co/yAAyB4yn8k If Trump shuts the federal government down, should federal employees be available to escort him to his beachfront resort in Florida for a 16-day holiday?

This is what happened:\n\n1) The Senate unanimously voted to keep the government open\n2) The House was ready to pass the bill\n3) Rush and Fox &amp; Friends criticized Trump\n4) Trump now wants to shut down the government, putting 800,000 people out of work the week before Christmas Last Tuesday, Trump said \u201cI\u2019m proud to shut down the government.\u201d And he did. Despite unanimous Republican support in the Senate and overwhelming Republican support in the House, Trump will leave 800,000 federal employees without paychecks. How\u2019s that for a holiday gift? Trump, the \u201cgreat friend\u201d of American workers, is now prepared to ignore the unanimous U.S. Senate bill to fund the government.\n\nWhile Trump heads off to his exclusive golf club in Florida, his Christmas gift to some 800,000 federal employees is to deny them their paychecks. https://t.co/cuMRN3C3po 85,000 children have already starved to death as a result of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen.\n\nMillions more face the prospect of famine and death.\n\nThe U.S. should be doing everything we can to support the ceasefire, not undermining it.

Medicare for All is not a crazy idea.\n\nWhat's crazy is that our health care system is designed to make as much profit for insurance and pharma executives as possible, while ordinary people die because they can't afford the care and medicine they need. I'm glad the First Step Act passed. But there is much more needed to achieve comprehensive criminal justice reform. We must:\n\n-End cash bail\n-End private prisons\n-End mandatory minimums\n-Reinstate the federal parole system\n\nOur primary goal must be rehabilitation, not punishment. Trump promised that his tax giveaway to the wealthy would put an extra $4,000 into the pockets of middle-class families.\n\nHe lied.

Over 50 killed in Gaza today and 2,000 wounded, on top of the 41 killed and more than 9,000 wounded over the past weeks. This is a staggering toll. Hamas violence does not justify Israel firing on unarmed protesters.

Unlike Trump, Congress\u00a0must take real action to lower the price of prescription drugs. That means passing legislation requiring Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices and allowing the reimportation of safe, low-cost prescription drugs from Canada and other countries. The president made clear today that he will not keep the promises he made during the campaign to lower the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs. Instead, he has become a supporter of the pharmaceutical industry's extraordinary greed. RT @CNNSotu: EXCLUSIVE: @SenSanders joins @jaketapper live this Sunday on #CNNSOTU.
