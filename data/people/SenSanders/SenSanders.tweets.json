They are hurting, and we are responding. https://t.co/nUS7ejQrvo The American people are hurting, and this comprehensive plan goes a long way to addressing the myriad crises that we face. This package, among many other things, increases direct payments by $1400, extends unemployment benefits, reduces child poverty by half, ensures we are vaccinating as many people as possible, and puts us on a path to safely reopen schools. As Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I am proud that we passed the American Rescue Plan, which, in my view, is the most significant piece of legislation to benefit working families in the modern history of this country. It is not acceptable to me that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. We need an economy that works for all of us. To do that, we must increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour and give 32 million Americans a raise. https://t.co/4vUBtY9Y1j The American people are reaching out to us.

If we want a strong democracy, we must make voting easier \u2013 not harder. What workers at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama are trying to do is historic. If they win and form a union, it will send a shockwave throughout our country.\n\nhttps://t.co/QN0I8hIPcp Obviously, as soon as we can, we must end the filibuster that currently exists in the U.S. Senate. Given the enormous crises facing working families today, we cannot allow a minority of the Senate to obstruct what the vast majority of the American people want and need. My own personal view is that the Senate should ignore the parliamentarian\u2019s advice, which is wrong in a number of respects. I am not sure, however, that my view at this point is the majority view in the Democratic Caucus. But even more importantly, I regard it as absurd that the parliamentarian, a Senate staffer elected by no one, can prevent a wage increase for 32 million workers. Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed by the decision of the parliamentarian who ruled that the minimum wage provision was inconsistent with the Byrd Rule and the reconciliation process. At a time when millions of workers are earning starvation wages, when the minimum wage has not been raised by Congress since 2007 and stands at a pathetic $7.25 an hour, it is time to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. This week, as part of the reconciliation bill, I will be offering an amendment to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. I applaud the Israeli health officials for their efforts. Making sure all Palestinians receive vaccines is the right thing to do from both a public health and moral perspective. I hope the Israeli government follows their advice as quickly as possible. https://t.co/Gnl2jLUton If Amazon workers in Alabama \u2013 a strong anti-union state \u2013 vote to form a union, it'll be a shot heard around the world.

It is a moral outrage that the wealthiest family in America, the Walton family, still refuses to pay workers at Walmart at least $15 an hour. Over the past 3 years, the Walton family became $84 billion richer, while Walmart's minimum wage has remained stuck at $11. Unacceptable.

Trump is the most corrupt president in history. Republicans in Washington are happy to cheer on Trump's bogus conspiracy theories on non-existent election fraud, but refuse to support him when it comes to providing a $2,000 direct payment to working class Americans facing economic desperation. Pathetic. Hey, Senator McConnell. The ball's in your court. Schumer, Pelosi and Trump all want us to pass a $2,000 direct payment for working-class Americans who are facing more economic desperation than at any time since the Great Depression. Leader McConnell, let the Senate vote! Jeff Bezos, the wealthiest man alive, became $83 billion richer over the past 9 months while Amazon made record profits. Meanwhile, Amazon workers are risking their lives to fill holiday orders and are denied paid sick leave and hazard pay. This ugly corporate greed must end. JPMorgan Chase illegally charged 170,000 of their customers with bogus overdraft fees and regulators let them off the hook\u2014 no fine, no sanctions, no nothing. No. The government does not regulate Wall Street. The truth is Wall Street regulates the government. That must change. https://t.co/nzSIMIFLZp That's funny. I didn't hear Sen.

The Biden Administration, on day 1, must bring forth a major economic relief bill that addresses the severe economic pain of working families\u2014 including more direct payments. During the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, there should NOT be a tradeoff between survival checks that the working class, seniors, children &amp; the disabled desperately need and emergency unemployment benefits. In the richest country in the world, we must do both. Over the past 9 months, 651 billionaires in America became over $1 trillion richer.\n \nDuring the same time, the working class, the elderly and the disabled were told to survive on just a $1,200 check.\n \n$1 trillion for billionaires.

In the midst of the pandemic, the economic collapse and climate change, Medicare for All, a $15 minimum wage, the Green New Deal, canceling student debt and taxing billionaires are not radical ideas.\n\nThey are exactly what the American people want and need. As bad as the pandemic has been for the overall economy, it has been far worse for Black and Latino workers. During the pandemic, nearly 60% of Latino families and 55% of Black families have either experienced a job loss or a pay cut. Congress must act NOW. The assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was reckless, provocative, and illegal. As a new administration takes power, it was clearly intended to undermine U.S.-Iran diplomacy. We must not allow that to happen.\n\nDiplomacy, not murder, is the best path forward. https://t.co/BzOhNmwSGv As profitable corporations like Walmart rake in billions in Black Friday sales, it\u2019s time for their workers to receive the hazard pay, a safe workplace, paid sick leave, a living wage and the benefits they deserve. https://t.co/oJtiaHNE2Z Wealth during 8 months of the pandemic:\n\u2b06\ufe0f$111 billion: Elon Musk\n\u2b06\ufe0f$78 billion: Jeff Bezos\n\u2b06\ufe0f$66 billion: Walton family\n\u2b06\ufe0f$48 billion: Mark Zuckerberg\n\u2b06\ufe0f$40 billion: Bill Gates\n\u2b06\ufe0f$30 billion: Larry Page\n\nMeanwhile, tens of millions face economic desperation.

Unacceptable. The new Congress must have the guts to take on the pharmaceutical industry whose greed is killing Americans. 250,000 are dead from coronavirus. 12 million will lose unemployment benefits by the end of the year.\n\nWhere's Trump?\n\nHe's busy golfing and sending out bogus tweets, trying overturn the results of a democratic election he lost by more than 6 million votes.

Meanwhile, the 50 richest Americans own more wealth than the bottom 50%. We have got to create an economy that works for all, not the 1%. Do not forget: A Green New Deal not only helps us lead the world in combating climate change, but will create millions of good jobs in energy efficiency, sustainable energies like wind and solar, transportation and agriculture.\n\nFor the sake of future generations, let's do it. The American people can't afford to wait any longer.\n\nEvery working class American needs $2,000 a month.\nEvery unemployed American needs $600 a week.\nEvery American needs healthcare as a human right.\nNo one in America should go hungry or homeless.\n\nThe do-nothing Senate must act.

During the pandemic, 647 billionaires in America have become nearly $1 trillion richer and now own twice as much wealth as the bottom 50%, while 40 million Americans face eviction. A society cannot sustain itself when so few have so much while so many have so little. #TaxTheRich The recent wave of arrests in Egypt of courageous human rights defenders from @EIPR is an outrage.

We must end this disgusting corporate greed. The Walton family is worth $238 billion. Yet they pay wages so low, 14,541 of their workers in 9 states are forced to rely on food stamps to feed their families. Outrageous.\n\nI say to the Walton family: Get off welfare.

The suffering people there do not need more bombs.  They need more jobs, food and health care. Today, we say to the prison industrial complex: Yes. We're going to enact real criminal justice reform. And we start by ending private prisons and private detention centers. No more profiteering from locking people up. We won't have a moral or sustainable economy when so few have so much and so many have so little. It's unacceptable that the 50 richest people in the U.S. own more wealth than the bottom half\u2014160 million. In the richest country on Earth let's create an economy that works for all. If you paid $14 a month for the Netflix standard plan, you paid more than Netflix paid in federal income taxes a year after Trump's tax plan became law - while making an $845 million profit and giving its CEO a $302 million compensation package. End oligarchy. #TaxTheRich Since Trump has been in office, he's provided $425 billion in federal contracts to companies that have shipped over 200,000 jobs overseas.\n\nNo, Mr. President. You're not standing up for working families when you give America's largest outsourcers billions in corporate welfare. https://t.co/e5fwXIzvL5 Here's how rigged the tax code is:\n\nIf you make less than $25,000 a year you are 9 times more likely to be audited by the IRS than a CEO who makes $30 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the top 1% is responsible for 70% of the $381 billion in taxes that go unpaid each year. #TaxTheRich Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple made over $54 billion in profits last quarter. During the pandemic, the founding families of these companies got $280 billion richer while 20% of small businesses shut down.\n\nIt's time to break up big tech and tax their obscene gains in wealth. While 12 million Americans recently lost their health insurance, the private health insurance companies are making record profits during this horrific pandemic.\n\nHealthcare must no longer be a privilege or an employee benefit in America. It must be a human right. #MedicareForAll https://t.co/RHyenhX6YJ Taiwan has been coronavirus-free for 200 days. It has had only 550 COVID-19 cases and 7 deaths.\n\nHow'd they do it?

We should do the same.\n\n#MedicareForAll Latina women must have equal pay for equal work: the whole dollar, not 55 cents on the dollar of what white men make. #LatinaEqualPayDay Donald Trump has gotten:\n\n-$885 million in subsidies for his real estate empire\n-$287 million of his debt canceled\n-A $72.9 million IRS tax refund\n-Free health care at a 100% government run hospital\n\nYes.

Senate Republicans are ramming through Trump's far-right Supreme Court nominee just nine days before Election Day, as over 50 million Americans have already cast their ballots.\n\nThe entire process to confirm Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court is illegitimate. https://t.co/bZBPhhE9ab It's an outrage that Senate Republicans are ramming through a radical Supreme Court nominee who will strip healthcare from 23 million Americans during a pandemic while doing nothing to provide economic relief to millions of working-class Americans who desperately need our help. Maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014the most essential people in our economy are not hedge fund managers.\n\nIf our farmworkers fall ill, we go hungry.

Pathetic. https://t.co/QI4VCIuNzk Here's what the Trump economy looks like: While 30 million Americans lost jobs, Goldman Sachs doubled its quarterly profits. No. Trump did not \"stop Wall Street from getting away with murder.\" He bailed out Wall Street and gave the 6 largest banks a $32 billion tax break. The Koch family is worth $113 billion, becoming $22.6 billion richer over the past 7 months. They could literally end child hunger and homelessness in America and still be billionaires. Instead they're trying to evict millions of poor people from their homes. How obscene is that? https://t.co/wt7T9tp5La The Senate today should not be dealing with a Supreme Court nomination which, absurdly, will be voted upon a few days before the presidential election.  What we should be focusing on is a strong stimulus package which protects unemployed workers and their families. No, Mr. President. You're not \"pro-life\" when you attempt to throw 23 million Americans off their health insurance and eliminate protections for pre-existing conditions. You're not \"pro-life\" when 68,000 Americans die each year because they can't afford to go to a doctor on time. If you paid $12.99 a month for an Amazon Prime membership, you paid more to Amazon than it paid in federal income taxes over the past 3 years combined\u2014after making nearly $30 billion in profits. Yes. It's time to make corporations pay their fair share of taxes. Mr. President: You want a \"big\" stimulus package. Great!

For the last 4 years, Trump has said exactly the same thing. Unfortunately, he's a pathological liar &amp; the only plan he has is to repeal the ACA, take healthcare away from 20 million and end protections for pre-existing conditions. That's 1 more reason why Trump must be defeated. https://t.co/sFWkxSMjSV The last thing the Senate should be doing right now is considering an extreme right-wing Supreme Court nominee who would strip health care benefits from over 20 million Americans and take away protections for preexisting conditions. No confirmation until after inauguration. https://t.co/JlRyRVOVXP The working class of this country is hurting. 840,000 Americans filed for unemployment last week, bringing the total number of new claims to 63.6 million since mid-March. The American people need a jobs program NOW, not another right-wing Supreme Court justice. The only thing the Senate should be doing right now is voting on a stimulus package to provide immediate economic relief to working class Americans\u2014 not ramming through a Supreme Court nominee who will strip health care from 20 million Americans in the middle of a pandemic. Let\u2019s be clear: Donald Trump is either a tax cheat who pays less in income taxes than the average worker, or a bad businessman who has lost money year after year\u2014likely both. https://t.co/N65OFA6ELS Science is real and masks save lives.

Let's end the drug war, legalize marijuana and expunge marijuana convictions. Trump promised he was going to provide \"health insurance to everybody.\"\n\nBut every single year he has been president the number of uninsured children in America has gone up. Now he's attempting to throw 20 million Americans off health insurance in the midst of a pandemic. SAD! The founders of Amazon, Facebook &amp; Google increased their wealth by $162 billion during the pandemic, while the companies they control enjoy monopoly power. It's time to break up big tech, tax the wealth of billionaires and create an economy that works for all of us, not the 1%. It would've cost the typical American over $100,000 to receive the same care Trump received for free at Walter Reed. In the richest country on earth, every American should be able to receive the same quality health care as Trump. Health care is a human right, not a privilege. Since Trump has been in office, he has provided $425 billion in federal contracts to companies that have shipped 200,000 jobs overseas. No, Mr. President. You're not standing up for working families when you give the largest outsourcers in America billions in corporate welfare. There are more confirmed coronavirus cases in the White House than was the case today in Taiwan, New Zealand and Vietnam \u2013 countries with a combined population of 124 million. We cannot continue to have a president who rejects science and whose reckless behavior endangers lives. My bill to tax 60% of the wealth gains billionaires made during the pandemic would increase Trump's taxes by $240 million &amp; provide healthcare to all. Instead, Trump paid just $750 in taxes &amp; received 100% government funded healthcare he ridicules as \"socialized medicine.\" Sad. \"Out of an abundance of caution,\" we should expand Medicare to cover everyone in America.

Are you ready for a radical idea? Billionaires in the United States should not be paying less in taxes than nurses, teachers, firefighters and truck drivers.\n\nIt's time to tax the $845 billion in wealth gains 643 billionaires made during the pandemic and expand Medicare to all. https://t.co/3GvFDKlb5G The average registered nurse paid $11,526 in federal income taxes, while Donald Trump, the self-proclaimed billionaire, paid just $750.

During this public health crisis, the Senate must also pass legislation to empower Medicare to pay all of the medical bills of the uninsured and the under-insured\u2014including prescription drugs\u2014for the duration of the pandemic. The American people cannot afford to wait another month. Here is what we must do: \n\nIn order to avoid another Great Depression, the Senate must pass legislation requiring the government to guarantee 100 percent of the paychecks and benefits of American workers up to $90,000/year. Our most vulnerable communities are hungry, desperate and under enormous emotional stress. It is incomprehensible for Senator Mitch McConnell to tell us that he sees no urgency in passing another emergency relief bill and that he wants to wait another month before taking action. What gives me hope right now are the new generations of young people who dream big and do not want to settle for the status quo. In the midst of a pandemic, health workers can't find basic equipment. We are forced to import:\n\n90% of our surgical masks\n70% of respirators\n90% pharmaceutical ingredients\n\nCorporate trade destroyed our manufacturing base. We must start producing our medical supplies at home. https://t.co/zrWwWT2Xdr A great nation is not judged by its number of billionaires or corporate tax breaks. It's judged by how we treat our most vulnerable people.

We should be bailing out the working families of this country, not the wealthy oil and coal companies. https://t.co/G3dGRmtMt7 Internet access is a necessity, not a luxury.

Second: Any legislation in the Senate to address the economic crisis must include a provision to guarantee 100 percent of the paychecks of workers up to $90,000 a year.

That is why they gave the exclusive power over war and peace to the people\u2019s elected representatives. I will do everything that I can as a United States Senator to prevent such a war. Let\u2019s be clear: another war in the Middle East could cost countless lives and trillions more dollars and lead to even more deaths, more conflict, more displacement in that already highly volatile region of the world. The Iraq war led to the deaths of 4,500 U.S. troops, and the wounding of tens of thousands. It led to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, and the displacement of over 5 million people.\n\nAnd after all that, the Iraqi parliament voted last week to boot U.S. forces out. In terms of Iraq, we were told that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, that he was working with Al Qaeda, and that we needed to invade Iraq unless we wanted to see another 9/11, or even worse, a nuclear attack.\n\nThose claims were lies. The result: the war in Vietnam cost us 59,000 American deaths and many others who came home wounded in body and spirit. In fact, a whole generation was devastated by that war. The casualties in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia are almost incalculable. When I look back upon American history I remember the two most significant foreign policy mistakes our country made in the modern era, and those are the war in Vietnam and the war in Iraq. And let us be clear, we were led into both of those wars by a series of lies.
