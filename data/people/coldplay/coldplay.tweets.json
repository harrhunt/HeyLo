PH https://t.co/sFsPMhWMEt The film's amazing director @MatWhitecross was G,W, J &amp; C's friend even before they were a band. He was filming them just hanging out from 1997. He was there to film the first rehearsal, and he's been filming them ever since. @Millerworld also got great stuff from 2000 on. PH https://t.co/MKGBGod5bq I love the early stuff from 1997-2000, when we were all so scruffy and innocent.  The X&amp;Y studio footage is fascinating - especially as I wasn't there so I didn't see it firsthand. So many great scenes in the movie... I love all of it! PH https://t.co/e5VQfUI9AM I'd say it's only 25% concert footage. Most of it is story-telling.  The concert bits are very cool though because we filmed shows all around the world. PH https://t.co/CudY0QZyzL I'm in it WAY more than I wanted to be. But Mat said I was an important part of the story / overall vibe. I guess because the film is really about friendship, and how relationships evolve through a crazy shared experience. @daveholmesmgmt in it too - as the voice of reason! https://t.co/MsV8c55myo The band were amazingly relaxed.  I don't think they objected to anything.  Chris hasn't even seen the film (he explains why at the beginning of the movie).  We love Mat like a brother and we trust him 100%.  He's a brilliant director so why interfere? PH https://t.co/uF4oIhoej6 AHFOD album / tour felt like the culmination and fulfilment of something. I guess that's why we put childhood photos of the five of us on the album cover: kids' crazy dreams coming true. The film is like a trampoline from one universe to the next... so much more to come! PH https://t.co/BS71xDm9xW Hola Argentina! Yes i've seen it many times now, at different stages of the edit.  Mat sent me the first cut around a year ago.
