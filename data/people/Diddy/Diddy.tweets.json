Comcast, and why this is bigger than just cable distributi\u2026 RT @KillerMike: My man @Diddy chiming In Comcast And the 1866 (not 1966) civil rights bill and its affects in Black TV station owners like\u2026 By taking this stance in the Supreme Court, Comcast has put its legal tactics ahead of the rights of millions of Americans to be heard. This is not OK.\n\nRead my full statement at: https://t.co/rCdc9LU6kk Comcast is arguing that this law only applies if racial discrimination is the only factor that leads to a refusal to do business, which would be extremely hard to prove. If they are successful, it will become much harder for any victim of discrimination to seek justice in court. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 section 1981 was designed to ensure Black people are able to do business in this country and not be denied because of race. First, it\u2019s important that people really understand what\u2019s at stake. In its efforts to get the lawsuit filed by Byron Allen dismissed, Comcast has taken a legal approach that could weaken fundamental civil rights protections. I have a problem with this. I also want to make clear that this case is now about much more than cable distribution. It\u2019s about the civil rights of millions of African Americans and other minorities. While it is true that we are in business with Comcast, it is not accurate to use my name or my network as an example of inclusion. I do not want my name to be used inaccurately so I must speak my truth. My name and my network, REVOLT, have been mentioned recently by Comcast in reference to the Comcast/Byron Allen US Supreme Court case as an example of Comcast\u2019s inclusive practices with respect to African American owned cable networks.

And as I have gained more experience, I have done a better job learning from my mistakes. Don't be scared to make mistakes. Remember to love yourself first. \u201cDon\u2019t ask if your dreams are crazy, ask if they are crazy enough.\u201d\n\nThis is a quote I\u2019ve always lived by and has helped me get to the point I\u2019m at.

You're invited!\u2026 You don't have to be black to drink CIROC, but you have to know the motivation behind what we doing is for us all to excel. I pushed myself to make sure that I excel at a high level because I know that it inspires my people. Let them know and understand the buying power of the culture and how we can break new brands. I'm a kid from Harlem, came into the spirits industry and redefined it. It's time for y'all to come move in next door and I'll show you the way! I'm going from me to we because it's lonely man! That's Black Excellence and that's what I'm about. I'm about the reprogram, you know this is the Black American dream!! At this point, it\u2019s bigger than me. God has blessed me to go from me to WE!! https://t.co/NroA1Dl9Os https://t.co/Aap1ILYO6p ATTENTION!!! \n\nShit could be worse.\n\nYou're not dead. Heal yourself, first. The rest will come later. I wanted to cause some disruption. We didn\u2019t want to do what everyone else was doing. It\u2019s something I\u2019m extremely proud of till this day. https://t.co/ZVGLMJaVVp \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n20 years ago today, Mase release the classic album HARLEM WORLD!! \n\nWhat was your favorite song on the album? https://t.co/0ieLc7qJCs Listen to my first joint with @Jeezy on https://t.co/dYqiIdnOuJ now!!! https://t.co/JK6OXt1AHT MOOD https://t.co/s7H5Wrhxvy Make your next move, your best move!!!
