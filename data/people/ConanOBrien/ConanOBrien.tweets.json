I can't believe the pandemic was renewed for another season. Bad news: the Libertarian convention has been canceled due to participants\u2019 moms being unwilling to give them a ride. I just learned that for the last 5 years, what I thought was my \u201cwife\" was just a cardboard MLB cutout. Thanks to @MichelleObama for having me on her podcast and letting me share my bizarre theories on marriage and children. Check it out @ https://t.co/Q0Tr4HD858. https://t.co/2mXvZr15Lg I\u2019m really excited to be on @MichelleObama\u2019s podcast tomorrow. Hear it exclusively on @Spotify @ https://t.co/Q0Tr4HD858 https://t.co/AWdEs8mWp8 I didn\u2019t have \u201crestoring democracy\u201d in my NBA playoff bracket.

Hear our conversation @ https://t.co/pfOk236hQr https://t.co/X6F6HCv45T Years from now, historians will look back on this period of American History and move to Canada. You can make any sentence creepier by adding \"consenting\" to it. \"Just two consenting adults, riding a tandem kayak.\" You know who has a good publicist? Steel Cut Oats. When this is all over, I'm going to miss wearing masks to Trader Joe's and speaking to everyone in a German accent. Can we agree? Anyone who's ironed his clothes in the last 4 months is a psychopath. I think I took the wrong pill from that Morpheus guy. It was a joy to talk to Michael Che about SNL, his approach to comedy, and that time I bought a t-shirt from him. https://t.co/pfOk236hQr https://t.co/toqEzpgkpm \u201cGrandpa Conan, tell us again what \u2018crowds\u2019 were.\u201d\n\u201cWhy the year was 2019.

Hear our conversation @ https://t.co/pfOk236hQr https://t.co/EHqPZ2J2LP We\u2019ve been in lockdown so long I\u2019ve had time to re-learn Spanish and re-forget Spanish. Face masks should have a reflective surface, so people who aren\u2019t wearing them can see what assholes they are. Now that everyone has more free time on their hands, any chance we can finally get around to changing the name of sour cream? I just heard that most of the babies recently born in New Zealand take a moment to look around then loudly say, \"Ohhh, HELL YEAH!\" Today is the Wednesday you thought was Thursday. Money-saving idea: get rid of Mike Pence, replace with a large vanilla milkshake. I spoke with my friend @JimCarrey about comedy, truth, and his new genre-defying memoir @ https://t.co/pfOk236hQr https://t.co/0uqm3PXFc4 I\u2019m excited to announce the launch of Twatch, my new live streaming service where you can watch me assemble jigsaw puzzles.

Today Dr. Fauci announced he\u2019s hopeful by year\u2019s end we\u2019ll have a release date for TENET. People are calling for the presidential debates to be canceled, but if that happens, how will I decide who to vote for? I let a jellyfish sting me today, just for the physical contact. I am still available if Joe Biden changes his mind and decides to go with a white woman. If Trump bans TikTok, what will I threaten to join when my kids don\u2019t do their homework? I\u2019ve got a new side hustle, and it\u2019s getting the hilarious @wkamaubell to be my friend. Check out my season opener and hear why he is definitely not interested. https://t.co/pfOk23nSHZ https://t.co/VF101nFdCc I can only imagine how slow Netflix streaming must have been while quarantining for the 1918 pandemic.

Have we settled on a term for all our new mask-related acne yet? Maskne? Macne? Covimples? Ladies, I\u2019m a 2-ply, washable cloth mask in the streets and a surgical n95 respirator in the sheets. I'm starting to resent the way my Postmate always says, \"Another 3-pizza Tuesday, Mr. O'Brien?\u201d Idea: we hire Jeff Goldblum to calmly talk this virus into chilling out. True Crime Podcast Idea: 'The Husband Didn't Do It'. It will be 2 episodes. Our father, who art in heaven-- what the hell, man? Wanted to watch the Chernobyl miniseries but thanks to Alexa I am deeply engrossed in \"Cher: No Bull.\" What a life she's had! Canadian border agents say \"No thanks, you diseased ingrate\" in the most polite way. Crammed a mattress into the Largo dressing room. I\u2019ve never felt like a bigger star. https://t.co/tlKLFyDujm Genuinely jealous of people who live in haunted mansions right now and get to have company over. Disney World is running a special where your ticket automatically gets you a Fast Pass to COVID. \"Let's meet for coffee\"- New Zealanders right now, rubbing our noses in it. We are living in a time when going to a museum belongs in a museum. Fun fact: Nudity is typically blurred out on TV because no one can get their genitals to sign a release form. If you\u2019re wondering how much weight I\u2019ve gained during quarantine, I just googled \u201cmale caftan.\u201d Bad news: I've been googling symptoms on the internet and it sounds like I have hypochondria.

Watch an all-new week of shows starting tonight @ 11/10c on @TBSNetwork. https://t.co/RZwTQGc3di Turns out the people who predicted the world ending in 2012 were optimists. And to think that this whole time, I respected Donald Trump because of his SAT scores. Strike one, Mr. President. How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck did CrossFit? My guess is more. I really enjoyed @JimCarrey's \"memoir.\" Like Jim, the book is wildly comic, inventive, subversive, and made primarily of compressed paper pulp. https://t.co/P7nnIixLzb https://t.co/tr1F0HKFoc RT @TeamCoco: \"I'm an impossible square.\" - @ConanOBrien shocks @RobLowe on a new episode of \"Literally!\" Watch part of their conversation\u2026 My first electric guitar! #TBT https://t.co/mG0j5HfKiL Just went to the doctor, my BMI is 40% ice cream.

With churches still closed I\u2019m forced to sneak glances at my watch at home. Just now remembering I left a tuna fish sandwich on my desk back in March. Not sure I like the revised MLB rules for this shortened season: first bunt wins? Odd. I'm going to be checking out @TheOutpostMovie today \u2014 very true and harrowing story of an intense battle in the Afghanistan War. I also plan to floss, but no one cares about that. I am thrilled I'm moving my show to @LargoLosAngeles next week. My family is more thrilled. https://t.co/4bAK5y3fwo This new book about Trump is sure to be his downfall.

It\u2019s the sound of your spouse chewing. Consider donating to @ChildrensLA's COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund to help meet the needs of patients, families, and caregivers during this unprecedented time. https://t.co/1CuMh6Pruu If you're missing the sensation of shaking a good friend's hand, I've found that a 4-day-old mango has a pretty similar feel.

If there is a scandal involving Christina Applegate, what would they call it? @hbomax @elmo This town only has room for one charming, red-headed talk show host. And it's you. I do believe that President Trump has been taking hydroxychloroquine. Since childhood. Troubling thought: What if these are the good old days?

If Trump wins in November, will he blame everything on the first Trump administration? Just went down a 4-hour YouTube rabbit hole, so \"tip of the hat\" to the Father of American Beekeeping: Lorenzo Langstroth. Tonight I described a Freudian nightmare in which my dad knocks a hotdog out of my hand after a dropped fly-ball at Fenway Park.

My wife was nearby, so I told him \u201cno.\u201d Just learned that when *I\u2019m* one of the options, instead of \u201cMarry, F*ck, Kill\u201d people play, \u201cPretend You\u2019re On a Call, Play Dead, Actually Die.\u201d Someone is suing Canada Dry Ginger Ale because it contains no ginger, so I\u2019d like to formally announce my lawsuit against Panda Express. My son\u2019s back-to-school backpack has a \u201cburner phone your parents don\u2019t know about\u201d pocket. People need to stop making fun of Trump\u2019s Space Force. I am all for this administration buying ideas from my 10 year old nephew Brandon. I'm glad the media is using her full name, \"Omarosa Manigault-Newman,\" so I don't get her confused with other Omarosas. I bet even George Clooney wishes he was George Clooney. Attention Investors: Tiny, waist-high fireworks that pop softly and don't scare dogs. You can\u2019t have fun anymore. https://t.co/wgBXwZn9b3 Without the moon, there would be no tides, and no name for what my brothers did to me. My wife caught me looking at Pinterest. I tried to cover it with a porn site, but she\u2019s fast. My kids don\u2019t believe it when I tell them how in my day, you could get an avocado toast for just $7. One thing you don't often hear: \"Hey, Dolph! No, not you, the other Dolph!\" I'm going on tour and bringing some friends with me.

(That\u2019s how Ninja did it, right?) I\u2019m starting a podcast about comity, it\u2019s called What The Heck. Okay, yep, that's on me, he got me good! (I just found out the recycling bin I've been using for 3 years was really @SachaBaronCohen all along.) There's going to be a movie about this whole MoviePass - nevermind it just lost funding. For the record, I don\u2019t want Rudy Giuliani doing my eulogy. I\u2019m taking comfort from the fact that those plans for making 3-D plastic guns were written by IKEA. I just got instructions for how to print a 3-D \"Pandora's Box.\" I don't know. Are we sure that was the LAST Airbender? Just got a pool floatie shaped like friends that want to come over and hang out with me. My son just came home from robotics camp. At least, I think that's him. Around the third sangria, the women catch on that nobody invited me, but by then I\u2019m off to the next book club. When I was a kid at sleep away camp, I still remember how exciting it was to get a letter from my Mom and Dad's attorney. When I grill burgers, I take a tip from the restaurant guys and, at the last minute, sprinkle in just a hint of e.coli. I thought the Shazam movie was about a superhero with the power to guess the name of any pop song. I truly hope there are people in France who believe that, in America, LeBron is known as TheBron. Just noticed the poster for Mamma Mia 2 features as many people of color as a poster of me. These are the best Spanx I've ever worn. #ConanCon https://t.co/Ar7QgoFkYR I love it here at Comic-Con. I\u2019ve got the entire Gotti panel to myself. #ConanCon I have X-ray vision, but it only works on objects wrapped in very thin tissue paper. #ConanCon At any given point during Comic-Con, San Diego is the #1 place on the planet for tights drying in hotel bathrooms. #ConanCon I got my hands on the Batgirl audition tapes. @Nick_Offerman has this one in the bag. #ConanCon https://t.co/b8ZSqBDS8q Comic-Con's the best - I've already seen a Batman, a Superman, AND a Spider-Man, all trip over a Bird scooter on the sidewalk. #ConanCon I'm a better Batman than Christian Bale and Michael Keaton combined. https://t.co/Ft8tX7YC62 I love Comic Con. Just saw Thanos arguing with hotel front desk about not getting an ocean-view room. #ConanCon I just saw two Rocket Raccoon cosplayers fighting over a Princess Leia wig! Oh wait those are real raccoons fighting over a Cinnabon. #ConanCon Is it me or is Putin riding Trump like an e-Scooter? Sure, everyone loves Chewbacca - unless you\u2019re the guy who has to keep coming over to snake out his shower drain. #ConanCon As a kid, I knew I was in trouble when my Mom would say \u201cConan Christopher O\u2019Brien\u201d through the megaphone she borrowed from the SWAT team. Song Titles (Are Cooler When Part of the Title Is In Parentheses) Every father wants to hear those precious words: \"Daddy, I won the lottery.\" Decades ago, James Brown tried to warn of our jobs being taken by sex machines, but would we listen? Elon Musk didn\u2019t save the Thai soccer team, but he will put them on a Tesla waitlist. It\u2019s so hot out I keep dunking my head into my relationship with my father. If someone ever body shames me I'm going to clap back. God, I'm lost. Musicologists now believe Beethoven wasn\u2019t really deaf, he just pretended to be to avoid hearing Schubert\u2019s boring stories about his fraternity pranks. One of these Sundays, I\u2019d like Pope Francis to say \u201cGod\u201d the way the FIFA announcer says, \u201cGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL!\u201d With the kids off at camp, my wife and I finally have some precious time to check Facebook in separate rooms. After four margaritas, I call it Cuatro De Julio. In the new James Bond movie, Bond apologizes to women for his behavior and is never seen again. About to peel an orange. AMA Does it help the environment if I drink vodka out of a reusable water bottle? I\u2019d like it to be on the record that I was making \u201cPaul Rudd\u2019s penis is ant-sized\u201d jokes LONG before he ever played Ant-Man. Step on this little raised platform and I will guess your weight with astonishing accuracy. Stove Top Stuffing is my favorite side-dish that sounds like a Midwestern porn video. Don\u2019t mean to brag, but my latest colonoscopy is getting 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. One sensuous glance and I knew: she was waiting for my coffee order. I will pay for a remake of the remake of The Last Jedi, starring only corgis. Meek Mill would also be a good name for a factory that grinds up gentle folks. Is it bad that Hereditary made me feel a lot better about my childhood? No matter how bad things might seem right now, at least we still have Nick Offerman\u2019s insane giggle: https://t.co/FPy37tBjAm A little fact about me: \u201cI can hold my pee all night\u201d was my least successful pickup line. Either I was a terrible NBA coach, or my players just weren't good enough to run my patented heptadecagon offense. I just saw 3 of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons on eBay. All I want for Father's Day is for my kids to stop calling me \"Not-Dwayne-Johnson.\" I\u2019m still confident Tiffany Haddish will not reveal what I did at a party to Steve Martin. One big perk of being part of the new AT&amp;T/Time Warner family is I now have access to the exclusive FIFTH bar. There's no one I'd rather go Super Saiyan with than @RonFunches. https://t.co/w9pzicAGwp #CluelessGamer #DBLegends My goal is to be featured in a piece about celebrities called \"You'll definitely believe what they look like today\" Thank you to @ProdevHaiti and my young friends at Ecole Nouvelle Zoranje for sending me this beautiful mural. https://t.co/4LmbnRYNqL After I retire, I want to move to Vermont and confuse visitors by opening a \u201cBed OR Breakfast.\u201d Hard to believe that it used to take days, even weeks, to call someone you disagreed with \u201cHitler.\u201d Hats off to the team of puppeteers who control Rudy Giuliani\u2019s facial expressions. President Trump and Kim Jong Un reportedly have different ideas of the word \u201cdenuclearize.\u201d It\u2019s just like \u201cLaurel vs. Yanni\u201d except with the whole planet at risk. Great news, my mom just called to say Scott Pruitt bought a broken ottoman from her garage sale for $275,000.

He was a carpenter, but He didn't bring it up every time you met Him. America Ferrara had a baby. I\u2019d like to see Trump \u200b\u200bclaim that kid wasn\u2019t born in \u201cAmerica.\u201d I can\u2019t tell you how much I\u2019ve enjoyed hikin\u200bg the Appalachian Trail these past 22 days with Melania Trump. I did not know that \"prison reform\" was something I could talk about with Kim Kardashian. Trump! Right? Wow. &lt;--- just RT this when applicable. There's nothing worse than people online who feel they can just command others to discuss a topic they bring up. Discuss. So there's going to be a Boba Fett movie, but still nothing for that show-stealing temptress, the Thala-Siren?!? https://t.co/ujBBPcwQ08 I can't find anyone to see Solo with me this weekend, so I guess I'll be flying\u2026alone.

My wife\u2019s new nickname for me is \u201cPrince Harry if I squint.\u201d I never get more than halfway through my sci-fi movie pitch before my therapist says, \"our time is up.\" I played #TheShow18 with fellow great athlete Aaron Judge (@TheJudge44). #CluelessGamer https://t.co/1dq02U7Egi It is a time of turmoil. It is a time of confusion. It is a time of great tidings but also of grave misgivings. It is a time of upheaval but also a time of downheaval. It is a time of tweeting while drunk on Pinot. The only thing keeping me from starting my own doomsday sex cult is that I look terrible in sunglasses. Can we make ie and ei interchangeable so that no matter what, I never misspell recieve? Doesn\u2019t every single picture of Michael Cohen look like he\u2019s saying, \u201cOh, we\u2019re not allowed to do that?\u201d I'm confused - if Obama won a Nobel Peace Prize, shouldn't Trump be trying to dismantle the entire Peace Prize industry? Please no spoilers for 1)  #TheAmericansFX and 2) #TheAmericansUS, if you know what's going to happen to us. Did you know if you follow Rudy Giuliani on Twitter, it will suggest you also follow several twitter accounts promoting rabies awareness? If Trump wins a Nobel Peace Prize, I bet he\u2019ll try to trade it in for an Emmy. My Mom always says \u201chomemade gifts are the best.\u201d Hope she enjoys the meth.

When we give each other a thumbs up, it's our way of mocking every other animal on earth. Twitter has been abuzz over Selena Gomez\u2019s spray tan at the Met Gala. In other news, we may be having a nuclear war with Iran. I just heard that the emails telling Tesla customers their cars will be delayed by 2 years have been delayed by 5 years.

I told my neighbor Greg to check out \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and now I see it's breaking box office records so YOU'RE WELCOME, MARVEL.

I bet we can get Trump to resign with an offer of an Apprentice reboot. In preparation for Infinity War I'm watching every Chris Hemsworth movie, even the one where he plays a computer hacker, just to be buff torso. I mean safe.

As my father used to say, a frown is just a smile that's been rotated 180 degrees on its x axis, assuming the origin is located at the longitudinal midpoint of said frown. I save money on cheese by only trapping mice in a prison of their tortured memories. Alexa, stop watching me shower. I\u2019m looking for a pill that gives me 4 hours of drymouth, but with no risk of erections. I really, really, really want to see Donald Trump spell \u201cRudy Giuliani.\u201d Congratulations to @jaketapper on his new book @TheHellfireClub.

No one on Earth has ever said, \"Hooray! Salmon burgers!\" An executive just emailed asking if I\u2019m available for a modern-day reboot of the \u201cConan\u201d show. New on 23 and Me: a feature that tells you if you were fathered by Donald Trump. I also paid my doorman to lie once - he told the delivery guy my order was for two people 25 years ago today, I put on a terrible jacket and auditioned for Late Night on NBC.

Bad news: Trump\u2019s border wall has already experienced a serious breach: https://t.co/oqcwEmjbre In Hell, the radio is only the Kars for Kids commercials. Want some juicy Hollywood gossip? After three drinks, I sometimes mispronounce \u201cCharlize Theron.\u201d I just saw a cloud that looked exactly like my father withholding his approval. Last night, the portraits of Washington and Jefferson quietly snuck out of the White House. When I was a kid I thought by now we\u2019d be living on the moon and zipping around in flying cars and sleeping in the same room as your wife. After seeing how Ivanka is treated in the press, I\u2019m so grateful I decided against hiring my daughter then asking her to constantly lie for me. Trump just made his own shadow sign an NDA. My son asked if I\u2019d take him to see Sherlock Gnomes and I told him, \u201cGnome thanks.\u201d I\u2019ve been waiting for a high-five for three days now.

Coming soon to theaters nowhere: \"Due Buffoni\" starring @jordanschlansky and Conan O'Brien. #ConanItaly premieres April 11th @ 10/9c on @TBSNetwork. https://t.co/AFda32H92F The only thing I don\u2019t love about those \u201cMedieval Times\u201d restaurants is how you die at age 30. I miss the rites of spring from my childhood, the snow melting, the birds chirping, me being cut from the baseball team. I\u2019m pretty sure the audience appreciated my standing up repeatedly and saying, \u201cActually, it\u2019s PANTHER OF COLOR.\u201d I took fake Italian and real CONAN employee @jordanschlansky to Italy. Watch #ConanItaly April 11th @ 10/9c on @TBSNetwork. https://t.co/1BLYO0NZDt .@JuddApatow did a beautiful job making #TheZenDiariesOfGarryShandling. It\u2019s about so much more than a great comedy mind. Watch it starting tonight @ 8pm on @HBO. I hope President Trump knows what he\u2019s doing with these tariffs. Just had two eggrolls at Panda Express and it cost me $611.00. Saying John Bolton looks like a walrus isn't fair. He looks like a muppet walrus judge. 75-year-old Joe Biden wants to fight 71-year-old Donald Trump. The winner takes on Bob Newhart. Radiohead just beat out The Cure in my March Sadness bracket. Ben Affleck\u2019s back tattoo has given me the courage to share mine: https://t.co/hFL5G8HpQY Donald Trump, Jr. has brought shame to his family name by only having one divorce. Wow, the new President of Russia looks so much like the old President! Trump has become such a divisive figure, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s ruined that hairstyle for other men. Putin is going to win re-election in a landslide. Because his opponent is going to die mysteriously in a landslide. Read the tweet above this. Now read the tweet below this. COINCIDENCE??? Sometimes I feel bad for Melania, but then I remember she once killed another model with her teeth. The chances of picking a perfect March Madness bracket are 1 in 9.2 quintillion. Which sounds impossible, but 5 years ago those were the odds Donald Trump would be president. My new workout regimen: sumo wrestling with @KevinHart4Real.

President Trump has been consulting with Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment lawyer. The lawyer is a partner at the firm of \u201cNotta, Good, &amp; Sign.\u201d DID YOU KNOW: Hot Dog on a Stick was originally established as a warning to hot dogs who betray the King. My show is not on TV tonight, but you can still laugh and cry while watching the March Madness Selection Show @ 6pm ET on @TBSNetwork. How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if he had a CHUCK-CO Wood-a-Pult 4000? \u201cMcMaster\u201d sounds like what happens when a German guy makes up an Irish name.

That explains their new slogan, \u201cQuantity.\u201d There\u2019s too much news now. I just found out about the new aluminum tariff from my Snapple cap. March came in like a lion and was shot by some rich a-hole. My favorite wine is a 1965 Timothee Chalamet. I told my kids that at their age I had to watch VHS tapes on school safety, and they said \u201cwhat\u2019s school safety?\u201d If bumblebees truly do communicate through dance, what are the white ones supposed to do? President Trump will be attending Evangelist Billy Graham\u2019s funeral. So apparently, Graham\u2019s being buried at a golf course. When our kids were babies, my wife and I played them Salieri instead of Mozart, and now they\u2019ve grown into jealous, brooding schemers.

I\u2019m available to represent Hungary in the 2022 Winter Games. Just tell me the sport and I\u2019ll start taking lessons. Trump\u2019s plan to save the environment is to arm the trees with pollution. If I could play any musical instrument in the world, it would be a violin that has twenty million dollars hidden inside it. I just went to this crazy 80s retro party where we ended up invading Grenada. They should make brownies that look like joints but contain no marijuana. I can't stand wheelchairs. Damn, I messed up the punctuation on that one. It should be: \"I can't stand! Wheelchairs?\" Mike Pence just won a gold medal in his winter Olympics event, \u201cthe frozen stare.\u201d I'd say the worst example of a retailer piggybacking on a cool movie's hype is the new Macy's campaign: \"BLACK PANT(s for) HER\" Our Italian adventure is over.

I don\u2019t know how this happened but apparently I was just traded to the Cavaliers??? Still trying to figure out how Nancy Pelosi\u2019s 8-hour speech fits into the Cloverfield Universe. So you\u2019re telling me, I\u2019m the *only* person at this party who thought the \u201cB\u201d in \u201cBYOB\u201d stands for \u201cBotulism?\u201d Scientists have recreated the face of a teenage girl from 9,000 years ago.

Still reeling from @realDonaldTrump\u2019s very negative Yelp review of Haiti, which means I\u2019ll love it. Headed to Haiti later this week to explore and make some new friends. Stay tuned for my report. #ConanWithoutBorders In his new movie, Liam Neeson is \u201ctaken\u201d in an elderly insurance scam. I know an awesome recipe for opening soup. A) I\u2019ve never been to Richmond, VA and B)  I showed you my tattoo in confidence. https://t.co/BYLgaJtSIQ President Oprah would sit down with Kim Jong-un for at least three segments. I finally finished a Chapstick without losing it or putting it through the wash. Time to die. Funyuns: not all that fun. Discuss. In LA, I have trouble guessing how old people my age are. If you haven\u2019t yet seen the movie, \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d SPOILER ALERT: Whatever shape container you put it in. The Mega Millions drawing is going to make someone an instant Republican. It's starting to look like the Russia investigation will finally bring Trump down. And by bring down, I mean get him reelected. One thing we can expect from this fight between Donald Trump and Steve Bannon: A lot of heavy, labored breathing. Personally I'm secure about the size of my nuclear button. Still waiting for Donald Trump to be downgraded to a tropical shit storm. How many people have been wrongly charged with murder because they\u2019d just finished eating a pomegranate? 2018: what could go right? Sad! This is the spread at the Mar-a-Lago New Year's party! https://t.co/fAbMMkjQtB I can\u2019t wait until 2017 is over.  And 2018, 19, and 20. After what happened to 2017, 2018 is refusing to come out of its room. A hilarious thing to do when you're waiting too long for something is roll your eyes and say \"What IS this, the Mueller probe?\" Let me put an end to the rumors: the creature in \"The Shape of Water\" is not me in hi-def. My egg nog koi pond looks beautiful, especially with all the fish resting on the surface oh my God what have I done? Happy Holidays to those of you who celebrate holidays. #Bases #Covered I love my family's Christmas Eve tradition of gathering around the piano and telling Uncle Sean to put his pants back on. I met Santa at the Macy\u2019s in Seattle. He\u2019s now suing me for breaking his femur. #MerryChristmasEve https://t.co/IEQDP6PELg The most commonly spoken phrase this week in all homes - \"Do you have the Scotch tape?\u201d Not a good sign: the first thing on Trump's Christmas list is one of those jackets like Mussolini wore. In Seattle for Christmas and there\u2019s only one way to travel: Monorail!!! #Simpsons #HoJu https://t.co/B8xBLehBuQ Stuck on a gift for Senator Mitch McConnell? You can't go wrong with body glitter. Rich people are really going to take a bath with this new tax plan. In money. They will bathe in money. Reading about the White House while watching #TheCrown. Could they, would they, consider taking us back? Want to co-host my show for a day and get your own podium next to @AndyRichter? Visit https://t.co/lRasL5jGl9 to enter and learn more about @NEXTforAUTISM. Pro-tip: do not go Christmas caroling in a Stand Your Ground state. Here comes Santa Claus, here come Santa Claus, right down the 405 until he hits the 101 which is backed up all the way to Glendale thanks to a jack-knifed trailer. All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth dipped in gold and turned into drone remotes. If the Christmas carolers at my door are really good, I turn my red swivel chair dramatically toward them. Just received Betsy DeVos\u2019s \u201cMarry Chrissmiss\u201d card. \"Stuck a feather in his cap and called it macaroni\" was for many years the textbook definition of insanity. I\u2019m not sure I agree with Roy Moore\u2019s position that \u201clife begins at masturbation.\u201d Just got picked up in a self-driving Lyft. And the driver still talked my ear off. Tonight I hung out with Chris Hemsworth, Ryan Reynolds and Channing Tatum at this cool bar called Never Gonna Happen\u2019s. Trump has been uncharacteristically quiet on Twitter. I bet his staff tricked him with one of these https://t.co/dCNTnOGtrd Just saw @mulaney at the Orpheum in Los Angeles and I have not laughed that hard in memory. I want to grow up to be that funny someday. https://t.co/NmemTUnqoN Trump just made even more people angry -- he plans to recognize Lannisport as the capital of Westeros. I prefer that other Chinese curse, \u201cMay you live in boring times, near a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.\u201d Please don\u2019t @ me, I\u2019m on a news cleanse. I just spent 3 hours trying to solve this Rubik's Cube before my son told me it's an apple. I may need a nap. Flynn pleads guilty and flips.  Finally, the 282nd sure thing to bring down the Trump Administration. A great thing about the new tax plan - if you own a race horse, you can write off its genitals as a small business. The GOP tax plan can only be read while wearing a monocle and shouting \u201cJeeves! Wipe me!\u201d Five hundred years ago, it would take months for word of a sitcom\u2019s cancellation to reach Europe. May you live in interesting times, like when your vice-president starts picking his vice-president. I returned a book to the library today and learned they really prefer it to be a book that was previously checked out of a library. The trailer for Marvel\u2019s new Avengers movie came out today, and it\u2019s starring every woman in America. Lifehack: Get a tattoo of your face on the top of your head so there's never a need to look up from your phone. A Mormon came to my door, and after a long, emotional, and persuasive pitch, I got him to start wearing longer sleeves. Latest entry in my Gratitude Journal: \"The Altoids people didn't go into the suppository business.\" Sometimes when things go bad, I only have other people to blame. I love that. I just heard the Dead Sea Scrolls at the new Bible Museum might be fake &amp; I'm now questioning the authenticity of this \"photograph\" they sold me. https://t.co/DU2b7vKJDu Trump is already tweeting that Black Friday is the most ungrateful of all the Fridays. This year, I'm breaking with tradition a little and stuffing my turkey with delusions of grandeur. Great news: scientists have bred a turkey that tastes exactly like tofurkey. President Trump didn\u2019t pardon the whole turkey, just the white meat. This week, 90% of all calls and texts are men contacting women in their past to say, \"Are we cool?\" A few months ago while in Israel, I met a man named Ofer Aloni. He shared a moving story about the loss of his daughter and a song he co-wrote about her with @thekin. It's called \"The Power to Choose Life.\" Please take a listen. https://t.co/GWiiVDCFBF Starting to think I shouldn't have ordered a hot sauce called \"Satan's Butthole.\" I gave blood today. It's more fun when it's on purpose. I like to think of myself as \u201cThe Blind Woman\u2019s Ryan Gosling.\u201d Took what I thought was a private hike with my friend @kevin_nealon. Now I see this. Sad. https://t.co/paUFp3aarg #Lineage2Revolution cinema quality graphics will make your flat screen so irrelevant, you won\u2019t even mind when I destroy it. Download @ https://t.co/nKRv6gQSyG to play on your phone. https://t.co/LHEpNVYosw #ad Fall in LA, when the trees get work done to look like they\u2019ve changed color. I\u2019m starting to think this bobblehead on my desk is nothing but a \u201cyes-man.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure those two drunk guys with knives at the end of the bar will work this out peacefully.\u201d \u2013 (Kim Jong Un/Trump Metaphor Tweet) Me, after my Uber driver asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s Andy really like?\u201d https://t.co/KgokzRkagE I believe that when we die, we all become podcasts. I'm ready for the all-female reboot of America. Dumbest move of my life: taking a Lyft from NY back to LA. Toyota Yaris. Thanks to Will Ferrell and @mark_wahlberg for coming all the way to #ConanNYC to talk about Boston. https://t.co/dIAgFc9py7 I saw the most beautiful thing in Manhattan today: a Chase Bank giving birth to a litter of baby Chase Banks. #ConanNYC Honored to have President @BillClinton join me at The @ApolloTheater. #ConanNYC https://t.co/dQvrpFyQ6c Gorgeous New York City!

Enter to be my co-host for a night @ https://t.co/lRasL5BhcH https://t.co/IbvWKD0PfV Tonight on #ConanNYC, Jon Stewart and I ask each other some bullshit questions. https://t.co/nZ7cHwAgMr Our heroes in uniform stood up for us. It's now our turn to #Stand4Heroes with the Bob Woodruff Foundation. https://t.co/PaVF2o4z9e https://t.co/OpHebaCFum I came back to NYC to tape my show at The Apollo and retrieve this bag of Cheez-Its I left on the L train last year. #ConanNYC https://t.co/YZWwN5WFnj Thanks to Harlem style icon @DapperDanHarlem for swagging me up and down. https://t.co/jUOrT89Bda #ConanNYC First day back in New York and I've already received dirty looks from 7 different police horses. #ConanNYC So glad my younger self did not know that my older self would be drinking canned water from France. A real man should know how to order whiskey: on the rocks, in a stemmed glass, and replaced with white wine. RT @jaketapper: A cool way to help wounded veterans: watch this video about our celebrity auction! https://t.co/5ejEHEWxKM https://t.co/eNJ\u2026 \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d but he goes back in time to sleep with John Connor\u2019s mom, so he can later just keep reminding John about it. This Halloween, I served tricks over treats. I will remember the beatings for the rest of my days. The next kid who knocks on my door gets a VHS copy of \"RoboCop 3.\" Pretty excited about my Halloween costume: French Maid With Intimacy Issues Due To Her Recent Breakup With Steve. Just had a nightmare that I was Justin Turners' shower drain. https://t.co/gJ02mJrYaz This year for Halloween I\u2019m giving out Canadian passports. \"Clayton Kershaw\" is the sound you make when you cough and sneeze at the same time. Watch @AaronRodgers12 and I discuss his injury and fight off feral hippos. #CluelessGamer #AssassinsCreedOrigins https://t.co/8jn6jROBUM The only way Trump will pardon the White House Thanksgiving turkey is if it promises to do the same for him in a few months. Just saw the updated Charlie Brown special where they grind up the Great Pumpkin to flavor someone\u2019s latte. It\u2019s only the fifth inning but both the Astros and the Dodgers just left early to beat the traffic. I get off on pouring good milk down the sink. https://t.co/innOdmSjOj Just got 49 flu shots for $1.99 at Costco. It\u2019s exciting that the LA Dodgers will be playing in the World Series, unless of course their pilots get picked up. We all done with artichokes?  Yeah?  Everyone?  Full consensus?  Good. I love autumn in L.A., when the leaves change on my screensaver photos. Rest easy America, I just heroically solved the Dave the Horse crisis. https://t.co/ZiG1XMy5Br This is a terrible day to be on Twitter, please log off. #evergreen Look, Steve Bannon has a good twin https://t.co/Ee3RRlTMv5 The latest trailer for The Last Jedi blew me away, but why were the first 30 seconds about car insurance? I liked Blade Runner 2049 but its view of the future was too positive. Just read another Harvey Weinstein article and now my brain wants an Altoid. Tonight on @colbertlateshow, two sex symbols talk shop. https://t.co/h8y13GgVol Backstage for my appearance on @ColbertLateShow tonight. They told me to take a photo, so I did. https://t.co/7K4mUkaiEj The White Stripes sang \"We're Going To Be Friends\" on my last \"Late Night\" show. It's one of my favorite memories. https://t.co/EKCofdNe9h The name Red Lobster is helpful if you totally forgot what color lobsters are. Trying to binge-watch all of the Geico commercials. I\u2019m up to season 117. Got styled by #Harlem #fashion icon @DapperDanHarlem. This is the before picture. #ConanNYC https://t.co/Av6pt3ectO At @SylviasSoulFood in #Harlem today, I learned that no hairnet can tame me. #ConanNYC https://t.co/6G2dvzKncr Just found out all of my childhood bullies were Russian bots. Will box office numbers adjust for all the men who buy Blade Runner 2049 tickets then \u201caccidentally\u201d walk into My Little Pony: The Movie? It\u2019s time Dress Barn updated their name to something cool. Like, Gown Silo. I\u2019m so glad they\u2019re going to make a new Blade Runner movie every 35 years. Performed last night with the hilarious @WildHorsesShow. That face I'm making is the first sign of a massive stroke. https://t.co/5ewiX2C6BE I explored a land of moist wood, no railings, and British Orcs with @kumailn. #CluelessGamer #ShadowOfWar https://t.co/GdErFRHpO1 The most disturbing detail about Trump's new tax plan is the requirement that The Rich audibly click their heels with every million saved. I was forced to do this by those pricks in Finland. Finland if you're still reading this, I love you. https://t.co/GJtYzA0JJD Just got my flu shot. Took three nurses and a guy from the gym. I used to clear my head of the news by lying back &amp; staring at the clouds but now Trump officials keep flying through them in private jets. Now I finally get why our national anthem was written by a lawyer. Best wishes to my Jewish friends who are fasting for Yom Kippur or because they\u2019re trying to make it in Hollywood I am trying to fire my mime. It\u2019s not going well. The cops raided the nail salon in my neighborhood and discovered a better nail salon operating in the back. Hey @nickkroll and @StephenAtHome, this photo was taken the day I replaced\nDavid Letterman. #PuberMe #PuertoRicoRelief https://t.co/J1013j4rbr Reminder: If your knees are scraped and bleeding, you are playing the oboe incorrectly. I'm taking the stage at Stand Up for Heroes on Nov 7, but you can help #Give2Veterans now. @Stand4Heroes gets a dollar for every retweet. There is nothing more or less worse than when you're not unable to determinate a tweet's meaning or not. Watch me take @TomCruise for a drive and blow his mind. https://t.co/1nWMttDRaB Tonight on @TBSNetwork, I unveil a revolutionary idea with @TomCruise. Yes, revolutionary. Since the word \"brink\" gets a raw deal, I'm going to use it in a positive way: I am on the brink of eating a nice fruit salad. Help my friend @diegoluna_ get funds to those who need it most in Mexico. https://t.co/zw8PZd6JUf I\u2019m starting to regret naming my son \u201cDonald Trump, Jr.\u201d It seemed okay 11 years ago. Graham Cassidy: terrible healthcare bill, great name for a folk singer. Melania Trump may sue over this Croatian billboard. Yesterday she said, \u201clittle bit of English? I happen to know a lottle bit of English.\u201d https://t.co/TtzDnUiii2 Happy Rosh Hashanah to @carlreiner and @MelBrooks, if they\u2019re Jewish.

Thanks to the people of Israel for tolerating this creepy goy. It\u2019s sad to realize that those dancing gangs in \u201cWest Side Story\u201d could have just settled their differences through fighting. Thoughts and prayers go out to Lay\u2019s Potato Chips, who are clearly having a nervous breakdown: https://t.co/vt5WXXx9UW At home alone, no one here but me and Amazon Alexa. Says she doesn't want to talk. There is nothing wrong with exploring one's sexuality--and that is my message to the California Highway Patrol. You can tell the summer is officially over when my dermatologist gives the order to \u201cRetract Shields.\u201d I am now seriously regretting that time I told Equifax how old I actually was when I finally lost my virginity. Hey, wait, I thought I was America\u2019s favorite scary clown. Autumn in California, where the leaves change color if you use the right Instagram filter. https://t.co/x9vkI5DUhl Knowing me, when the nuclear bombs fall, I\u2019ll be at CVS, reading the back of a bottle of exfoliating soap. Ahora mismo estoy pensando en todos mis buenos amigos en Mexico. For a guy with a billion dollars and a cool car, Elon Musk is kind of a downer. I think I found a way to get President Trump to read Obama\u2019s powerful statement about #DACA: https://t.co/lEPIeV67O3 I won\u2019t kill you with kindness, but I will mace you with charm. \u201cFirst of all, Your Honor, I prefer the term \u2018penis portraits\u2019....\u201d Remember how enthralling and distracting it could be to play with a bubble machine on a lazy summer\u2019s day?  Can we get Trump one of those? Toda/Shukran/Thank You to my Israeli, Palestinian &amp; American crews.

Even if Big Ben does go silent, I bet it won\u2019t shut up about its new juice cleanse. Just think, 100 years from now, our grandchildren will be taking down Senator Kid Rock statues. When the eclipse comes I\u2019m going to borrow the special glasses my wife uses when I\u2019m shirtless. Once asked SNL legend Herb Sargent what's the funniest thing you ever saw? He instantly said, \"Martin and Lewis, 1940's, in a club.\" Can\u2019t we just go back to being on the brink of nuclear war? A big hello to new White House communications director Hope Hic--what, fired? I heard the iPhone 15 won't have any ports or jacks or a screen and it will just be a smooth steel ball and finally we'll all be happy. I'm leaving America during this divisive time for the relative peace and quiet of the Middle East. https://t.co/RnVTythuzI #ConanIsrael .@TheNotoriousMMA joined us to explain how he's going to \"dismantle\" @FloydMayweather. https://t.co/BHD0aP14Ld #MayweatherMcGregor On August 21st, there will be a total eclipse - which will look amazing after you miss it and see pics of it online the next day.

I think it\u2019s wrong to just steal honey from the bees, so I always make sure to leave behind a few \u201cLate Night with Conan O\u2019Brien\u201d DVDs. You call it day drinking, I call it something unintelligible because I\u2019m day drinking. There are three ways to cook a hot dog: Boil, grill, and, I just discovered by accident, dry clean. Does this man bun make my unicycle look big? I still remember summer as a child, when my parents shipped me off to camp for 12 years. It\u2019s not fair, people are getting fired so fast at the White House that I don\u2019t get a chance to make fun of them #theMooch Sooner or later, Trump is going to realize that\u2019s just a sack of potatoes in Melania\u2019s bed. People are complaining that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s wax likeness doesn\u2019t look like her, but it\u2019s a much closer match than mine: https://t.co/G13ARbcYOr Pok\u00e9mon announced that Legendary Pok\u00e9mon will appear in gyms in the form of Legendary Eggs.  And guess what\u2026nobody gives a legendary crap. I had the craziest dream last night. I dreamt the Republicans managed to pass a piece of legislation. Just heard Chris Christie got booed while performing CPR on a choking victim. \u201cOJ Simpson Paroled\u201d is by far the worst reboot of the summer. Trump hired Anthony Scaramucci because he thought his tan qualified him as a \"person of color.\" I miss Comic-Con so much today I went to the DMV just to wait in line. So long Comic-Con! After seeing Marvel and DC people coexist in peace, I have hope for the Democrats and Republicans. #SDCC #ConanCon #Hope No, that\u2019s not a White Walker interviewing the cast of @GameOfThrones tonight. #ConanCon In honor of tonight's #GameOfThrones cast show, @nottjmiller welded himself inside an Iron Throne. https://t.co/FPLui7M0pN #ConanCon I hereby pardon myself for tweeting this tweet about Trump wanting to pardon himself.

Trump just fulfilled a campaign promise by quietly draining a small swamp outside Tallahassee. I just completed 100 push-ups. (I started last November.) Astronomers have discovered 10 new Earth-like planets, 8 of them recently taken over by talking apes. Say what you will about the new Ken dolls, I think they\u2019re summer\u2019s most insertable toy! I keep trying to think of a funny tweet about North Korea having nuclear missiles.  It\u2019s not coming. Today, we Americans celebrate our independence from Britain while planning our escape to Canada.

Mitch McConnell constantly looks like a kid who just stole all the gum. How long until we can pay for groceries by simply waving a hand over the register?

When you march the streets shouting with people it\u2019s civil disobedience, but do it drunk by yourself &amp; it\u2019s an involuntary 72-hour hold I dreamed I was driving 100 mph on the freeway and when I woke up I was driving 100 mph on the freeway. Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration is expected to be the most costly in US history.  And that\u2019s not even factoring in the money.

This Black Friday, I\u2019m choosing small local businesses for my frenzied, materialistic rampage. Just said \u201cCan you please pass the gravy?\u201d My uncle responded \u201cSocialist!\u201d Is it me or does the white meat seem particularly angry this Thanksgiving? Tried to pardon my turkey and he sued me for wrongful imprisonment and defamation. I'd like to go a whole day without hearing the terms \"Orwellian\" or \"Kafka-esque.\" I'd be flattered, if the category hadn't been \"Famous and Damaged\" https://t.co/IQG4oeYVYB Just looked at the holiday edition of Oprah's Favorite Things. #26 is the rare earth element promethium. I'm at Trump Tower, about to meet about a cabinet position. Sitting between Dustin Diamond and a guy that can swallow 50 eggs.

I had six stiff drinks and then voted. #RockTheVote https://t.co/0EOcZPSCsC Not telling you who to vote for but ask yourself: which candidate will give a more entertaining concession speech? Tomorrow, we Americans will make history by electing our 48th white male Vice President in a row. (The previous record was 47).

I'm that fidgety guy that sits to your left. https://t.co/afgR0jrNES It\u2019s weird that my therapy dog has no interest in hearing about my childhood.

One time I wore my brother's t-shirt, and my dad asked if I was dressing up as his favorite child for Halloween. My best chance of catching up on all the great TV shows is a non-fatal skiing accident. The Peanuts Halloween special is adorable, right up until the point when the Great Pumpkin orders Linus to kill.

Upon death, instead of having my whole life flash before my eyes, I just want to watch Season 3 of The Sopranos again I love waking up to the sound of birds arguing with their spouses. Only three people on the entire planet have ever said: \u201cHold my Olympic medal while I trash this Brazilian gas station.\u201d Lochte, Lochte, Pants on Fochte! Turns out the proper response to \u201cHow\u2019s it hanging?\u201d is NOT \u201cvia a complex network of pulleys and trusses.\u201d My stream of consciousness puts James Joyce to needlenose pliers.

This is right around the time of year I start calling my shorts \u201cThe Chafing Dish.\u201d Given current weather trends, a Sharknado is a distinct possibility. I always bring my baseball glove to the ballpark, just in case a falcon wants to land on my hand. I am devastated by the passing of Suzanne Wright.

My accountant informs me that I\u2019ve never been retweeted by @Cher Had a dream where evil space creatures intent on destroying humankind land, watch us for a few days, shrug, then take off.

I can\u2019t wait to see the pictures that Jupiter doesn\u2019t want released. Getting asked to be Trump\u2019s running mate is the new jury duty.

She\u2019s copsplaining that I\u2019m getting one anyway. Fears of the Zika virus will probably keep me from watching the Olympic men\u2019s tennis doubles. Everyone loves the \u201cpoop emoji,\u201d but I\u2019m telling you, beneath that smile there are worlds of pain. 2016 Trump/Newt sounds like a car that\u2019s about to be recalled. I\u2019m starting to regret having Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch over for lunch. Hey Conan here, with some 4th of July grilling tips. Only hire a caterer you trust. Ok enjoy the holiday!

It\u2019s like that time I walked to the bathroom without my slippers. Discovery Channel has said that from now on they will only air factual documentaries. Or as they were known in the old days, documentaries. At Dartmouth, 64 students are being accused of cheating in an ethics course. They've all been given an honorary doctorate in Irony. I\u2019m beginning to think I didn\u2019t get that role as young @icecube in \u201cStraight Outta Compton.\u201d Same-sex couples can now get married in Florida, and are pledging \"Til Meth Do Us Part.\" I still think those North Korean hackers are hiding in a RadioShack in Toledo.

As much as I love the theme music from the Serial podcast, it really killed the vibe at my Zumba class. I love seeing the look on my kids\u2019 faces on Christmas morning when I tell them we\u2019re Hindu. \u2018Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house, not a creature felt like pronouncing \u201cit was\u201d as two words. Got all my Christmas shopping done. Now to shop for other people. Didn't know you could squeeze up to 3 ounces of liquor out of a department store Santa's beard. Thanks, Martha Stewart! My wife wants our Christmas gifts to be handmade this year, so I carved her a Radio Shack gift card. All I want for Christmas is a cat-fight between Flo the Progressive Lady and Lily the AT&amp;T Lady. My Christmas present to all of you?  I took a naked selfie and deleted it. I\u2019m pretty sure I saw this department store Santa in an old episode of \u201cDateline.\u201d Crossed Kim Jong-un off my Christmas list. You have to take a stand somewhere. My father-in-law just found out I\u2019m that \u201cConan O\u2019Brien.\u201d Tonight I hang w/@IceCube &amp; @KevinHart4Real, get drunk with dolls, &amp; blow up a strip club on my TBS primetime special \"#CONAN To Go\". 10/9c. \u201cUnbroken\u201d was the original title for \u201cThe Human Centipede.\u201d Today I saw a truck carrying Viagra. And get this, it was a semi. By the way - no charge for that tweet. Did they really get a guy named \u201cChristian\u201d to play Moses? Star Wars\u2019 producers revealed the names of their new characters.  One of them is Charles Schwab. I hope North Korean hackers don\u2019t release the embarrassing emails I sent to Andy, slavishly praising our new boss Kevin Reilly. Don't tell anyone, but I got my father-in-law this @thirdmanrecords album:\u00a0http://t.co/CmWsdXg4l3. It sure beats last year's gel insoles. Tired of the weird looks I get whenever I pronounce the \u201ct\u201d in Christmas. I work out, I eat right - I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m developing breasts!\n\nWait, am I not texting my doctor right now? My high school marching band will regret cutting me from color guard after they see @FWong &amp; me in #YouTubeRewind: http://t.co/5ql0soD9hQ I\u2019m what\u2019s known as a \u201cTiger Dad.\u201d If my kids don\u2019t get straight As, I threaten to practice the violin.

I had a hunch China had passed America as the #1 economy when they started making all our \u201cAmerica is #1\u201d hats. Can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t get a Grammy nomination for my jazz album, \u201cGinger Odysseys, Vol. 9.\u201d Sorry about that, my son said he was just going to use my phone to play Angry Birds. Butt butt butt. It just hit me: if they are real, we are stepping in piles and piles of ghost dung. As we get closer and closer to the end of this tweet, I think it's important that we lower our expectations. I'm gonna get a bunch of #CyberMonday deals as soon as this thing boots up. http://t.co/f1DakGBVMI You can tell Charles Manson really loves his fianc\u00e9e by the way he hasn\u2019t murdered her. Still eating, mostly because that grass-fed turkey from Colorado gave me the munchies. The Greatest Generation stormed Normandy so that today, we could storm Target. I granted my turkey a last request, so now I've got to wait while it watches the entire run of \"Breaking Bad.\" I wonder if sales of Butterball turkeys would be as high if they'd used the name MargarineOrb. My wife told me a turducken was as close to a threesome as I\u2019m ever going to get. Stopped at a quaint Diner in a small town in rural Connecticut. This photo is in the Men's room. Why?? http://t.co/y5B5r5dRZU I\u2019ve been working out and now have the strength of ten men. And they\u2019re all Regis Philbin. Who has less-recognizable names? New Republican Congressmen or former Arena Football players? In preparation for Thanksgiving, I\u00b9m going to swallow an SUV\u2019s airbag and then run into a wall. Just read that Jaden and Willow Smith interview to my dog, and he looks less confused than I am. I took emotional Vulcan Jordan Schlansky coffee tasting. Watch the life drain from my eyes in the first minute: http://t.co/ADI00JKtKQ A 10-second kiss can transfer 80 million bacteria, my wife told me as we shook hands. I just joined the Mile High Club for people who tweet on the toilet. These days HD is so good, when you watch an NFL game you can see the murder evidence. I\u2019m grateful for those Kim Kardashian nude photos, because they reminded me to check my car\u2019s oil. Just saw my Thanksgiving turkey playing beach volleyball in Malibu.

So embarrassed - my wife walked in while I was watching that video on how McRibs are made. I guess we can finally put an end to the rumors that I killed Bin Laden. It\u2019s too bad. Conan Cumberbatch had a nice ring to it. Take a @Stand4Heroes &amp; help support our injured service members: http://t.co/PqhuKu1djN #Stand4Heroes Martin Short's terrific new book is out today.

To be clear, I\u2019m dressed as Hello Kitty for Hello Kitty Con, NOT Halloween. Just called my broker and told him to buy 300 shares of Neil Patrick Harris. Massachusetts was just named the most liberal state. Researchers almost picked California, but then they stopped for gas in Bakersfield. Tonight Ashton Kutcher talks about my two favorite topics: fatherhood and Charlie Sheen. http://t.co/SMAhxETYBP As if there weren\u2019t already enough reasons to hate Ebola, I hear it also smokes e-cigarettes. Kenny G has angered all of China, yet no one is telling him to \u201cstick to music.\u201d Personally, I think America is ready for a woman to scale the White House fence.

I\u2019m going as \u201cSlutty Madeleine Albright.\u201d Every once in a while, just for fun, I mail an Eviction Notice to @WarrenBuffett. My imaginary friend grew up to become my imaginary strength and conditioning coach I love autumn in L.A., when the colors change on the Fire Danger signs. The average Netflix user streams 46 hours a month. And the average senior citizen, 8 times a night. I asked nicely, but the DMV won\u2019t change the hair color on my driver\u2019s license to \u201cpumpkin spice.\u201d There\u2019s now a hybrid Lamborghini for environmentally-conscious men with small penises. I\u2019m pretty sure when the umpires say they\u2019re going to look at the replay, they\u2019re watching cat videos. Am I the only one who realized that \u201cFrozen\u201d was just an allegory for the U.S. leaving the gold standard in 1933? My lifelong dream of having interlocking feet and claw hands is finally coming true: http://t.co/hfI1X9JgA9 #LEGOBatman3 Tonight I\u2019m on #TheTalkingDead, which makes up for never getting to be on #TheWalkingDead (I was up for the part of Carl). When the freeway lanes leaving LA are blocked, and the lanes going into town are empty, then, yes, I do scan the horizon for monsters. Earthquakes seem to know when my dog is about to freak out. A 5-year old in California tested positive for cocaine. His parents became suspicious when he asked for \u201ca kilo of ice cream.\u201d My neighbors criticized me for putting a pumpkin out too soon. I had to tell them that was just me looking out the window. Just received my invitation to George Clooney\u2019s wedding\u2026. If the news gets any worse, the home page of Drudge Report is just going to be a giant skull on fire. Ben Affleck said that his penis looks better in 3D. Mine does too, but my wife refuses to wear the glasses. Still mountain biking during heat wave. Please tell me what I'm eating. Tastes like bitter almonds... http://t.co/ZLmC9PslOZ Mountain biking during heat wave. Just drank my urine. They sell it at Whole Foods. http://t.co/zFxAr8uqyc Well, the phrase \u201cgoing viral\u201d suddenly seems less cool. Giants! Pirates! Dolphins! Apples! Corduroy! You thought this was a baseball tweet at first, didn\u2019t you? Tweeting this from the White House. The Obamas look so peaceful sleeping. #shhhh If he or she owns finger cymbals, chances are the sex will be memorable. I like to go to Whole Foods, put organic stickers on conventional produce, then sit back and watch the fireworks. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer is banning his players from using Apple products. How do I get my kids on the Clippers? A flight from Boston to LA was diverted to Omaha after a passenger started masturbating.\u00a0Nothing kills an erection like landing in Omaha. I hope \u2018The Equalizer\u2019 is about Denzel being a badass by adding artificial sweetener to people\u2019s coffee without asking. An evangelical rewrote a Harry Potter book to rid it of all the witchcraft. Sounds bad, but I really liked her other book \u201c1 Shade of Grey.\u201d My iPhone 6 Plus is two days old and it\u2019s already bent. Has anyone else had this issue after leaving their phone on train tracks overnight? My wife is boycotting the NFL. Her boycott began in 1987. They\u2019re going to start locking the White House doors, but they\u2019re still going to let pies cool on the window sill. I\u2019m an X-Man, if crying yourself to sleep is considered a mutant power. I was going to buy the iPhone 6 Plus, but I already have a flat-screen TV. Scientists discovered fossil evidence of the first swimming dinosaur, and @kingsthings hasn\u2019t thanked me for not making a joke about it. iTunes is getting too invasive. Last night I woke up at 3am to find the new U2 album raiding my fridge. You might want to stay indoors today, Burbank. http://t.co/LrnVydt8a2 Today, Scotland and England laughed off reports they were breaking up and insist they\u2019ve never been happier. A baseball player got suspended for Adderall use. Football players think that\u2019s adorable. The iPhone 6 can take 20 selfies in rapid succession, in case you were worried about the selfie shortage. Backstage ready to perform at \"The Simpsons Take The Bowl\". I have extra hats. http://t.co/pGvb7XejdG When you think about it, every cake has the potential to be a crumb cake. I still think the third \u201cHobbit\u201d film could be stretched to 5 movies. The Dalai Lama says he should not have a successor and that the position has served its purpose. Sorry, Ray Liotta. I hear the iPhone 7 is going to be a landline! Some scientists want to replace the handshake with the fist bump. Others want to replace the fist bump with the \u201ctush push.\u201d I never forget a name, Bro. \u201cWhat drought?\u201d \u2013 Lizards \u201cGroot, I am.\u201d (Groot doing a Yoda impression) Quick question: Why is a flash mob of hipsters and yoga moms called a \u201cfarmer\u2019s market?\u201d I don\u2019t even trust real clouds anymore. On this Labor Day I'd like to salute the millions of Americans who day in and day out type 140 letters and hit Send. I'm opening a restaurant that only serves bread bowls filled with smaller bread bowls. Gummi worms are incredibly popular, so I\u2019m not sure why my line of gummi chiggers didn\u2019t take off. I hate being recognized in restaurants, except when the waiter says, \u201cShall I put it on your tab, Ms. Swinton?\u201d A woman is suing McDonalds because she bit into a Big Mac and found a Starbucks. I hope I never discover a genie when I\u2019m really hungry, tired, or unhappy with my cell phone reception. I just got waylaid in Malay by Pele. So liberating - just threw car keys into ocean. Glad they weren\u2019t my car keys. Sweating like crazy. May have to switch to men\u2019s deodorant. Just taught my kids about the current U.S. Congress by taking their ball, going home, and crying. Whole Foods has started selling rabbit meat? That\u2019s great, I was looking for a place to buy way-too-expensive rabbit meat. Tonight on #CONAN it's an hour of our most unprofessional and embarrassing rehearsal moments. If you like human error, this show's for you! No one will see \"The Expendables III\" for me. I think the ice bucket challenge caused some permanent shrinkage. When I retire I\u2019m going to pursue my first passion: inventing pancakes that can be sold by the loaf. \u201cAm I Groot?\u201d (Groot having an identity crisis) When does the Red Sox\u2019s season start? Have you seen those baby panda triplets? Two of them are really cute! I've accepted the #ALSIceBucketChallenge. Haven't checked the internet, but I think I'm the first celebrity. http://t.co/cxnx1iPi9G I can\u2019t believe some jerk already has the license plate I requested: MSCORSESE Today I looked at some great times I had with Robin over the years. God bless him, he still really makes me laugh. http://t.co/UPB3JmtaZZ Absolutely stunned to hear the news about Robin Williams. It's unimaginable to me that we've lost such a genuinely funny and sweet man. Still no listeners for my new podcast about all my favorite podcasts. I named my dog \u201cSpot.\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound hip but it\u2019s short for \u201cSpotify.\u201d Today, a historian told me the real Sam Adams never actually brewed a Blueberry Oatmeal Summer Stout. If you\u2019re wondering what I was like in college, one time I had a pregnancy scare with my pillow. 60% of Americans say they believe the nation is in a state of decline. The other 40% didn\u2019t know what \u201cdecline\u201d meant. To anyone in that Russian crime ring that stole all those passwords: can you help me get into my Pinterest account? .@AndyRichter &amp; I teamed up with a talking toilet for some water-saving tips from @NRDCWater &amp; @NRDC: http://t.co/uj5wq5MGlo #TeamCocoH20 I don\u2019t think it helps that Sudafed has started putting \u201cOur Favorite Meth Recipe\u201d on the back of the box. The full @OITNB cast is on #CONAN tonight on TBS. Coincidentally, \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d is the same pick-up line I used in college. Look out, Brits! #CONAN will appear in the UK on @truTVUK. Consider this revenge for dumping @SimonCowell on us. #truTVIsComing You've done the hard part: deciding which of the thousands of #Sharktopus viewing parties to go to. Now, watch in awe tonight on Syfy at 9. I believe it was the great Russian filmmaker Eisenstein who said, \u201cShit, it\u2019s cold here.\u201d Google has a new plan to eliminate porn-links from non-porn-Internet searches. Good news for all 4 of you. I'm in London, doing my best to keep a low profile: http://t.co/dYh0CT3Yil @TruTVUK #TruTVisComing Still can\u2019t believe that \u201cElon Musk\u201d isn\u2019t an Eastern European cologne tycoon. This is the funniest thing I've read in a long time: http://t.co/rorvWpUCb6 I\u2019m known throughout LA\u2019s Karaoke bar scene as \u201cthe Closer.\u201d Recently decided that eating cherries is no longer worth the effort. Perfection is something I regularly atain. You asked for it, here it is: my cameo in #SharktopusVsPteracuda. And when I say \"you,\" I mean \"no one.\" -&gt; http://t.co/Bv5qREgdte I\u2019ve been in my office with the door closed for an hour and a half, thinking about how weird a name \u201cJolly Rancher\u201d is. An apple a day keeps the doctor away, especially if you shoot the apple out of a T-shirt cannon at the doctor\u2019s face. People keep asking me for more footage from my Tinder sexcapade with Dave Franco. Here it is, perverts: http://t.co/OLsARAjLK5 Hostess is bringing back the chocolate covered Twinkie. Anyone looking to eat healthy should just stick to the regular Twinkie. The U.S. Census bureau found that only 7% of Americans identify themselves as bisexual. This is shocking new to anyone who watches porn. Not sure I\u2019m on board with the idea of \u201c6 Californias.\u201d But I am very interested in the idea of 35 Rhode Islands. Tonight Dave Franco helps me learn about Tinder. Also tonight, I learn how cruel the internet can be. http://t.co/c5hpTFiEcj So Stephen Colbert debuted the first masturbating bear?\u00a0Tonight, I make @StephenAtHome pay for his grotesque lie.\n\n\u00a0 In recent speeches, President Obama has been calling on Americans to stop being so cynical. He\u2019s probably getting paid to say that. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes has some pretty crass product placement, especially the scene where the apes start wearing Skechers. Gonna kick this BBQ off right with my favorite summer groove: Bjork\u2019s \u201cHuman Behaviour.\u201d Ladies, let\u2019s just say that the carpet matches whatever the metaphor for back hair would be. I\u2019m having martial problems. That\u2019s not a typo, I have trouble conducting myself properly during wartime. Money-saving tip: for one week, eat all your meals at a Shell gas station. I always thought that \u201cIrish step dancing\u201d should be called \u201cIrish, stop dancing.\u201d Sure, the Silver Surfer is a cool comic book character, but I prefer the Pewter Boogie Boarder. To save time I\u2019m combining two tweets. Sure, if you like tomatoes, that is! Why do we put all this pressure on clouds to look like other things? Let\u2019s let clouds be clouds! My Golden Retriever sure loves his new fedora and shades from Douchebag Dogs. DON\u00b9T watch \"The 4th of Julie\", it is NOT about our country's independence. Deleting browser history now. I buy all my flags on July 5th. My favorite song about a haunted concierge desk would probably have to be \u201cHotel California.\u201d Why do assumptions always require you to \u201cwork under\u201d them? I\u2019d rather \u201cplay over\u201d them! (Conan hits send, has phone taken away by nurse) I'm going to miss the World Cup when it's over. It\u00b9ll be hard to go into a bar &amp; not hear people yelling about something I don\u00b9t understand. My kids have really been inspired by this year's World Cup.\u00a0 My son just bit our dog. IKEA is giving its US workers a raise. The CEO said, \"We want IKEA workers to stick around longer than IKEA products.\" Just read an alarming statistic: by the age of four, the average child has already seen over 3,000 hours of GEICO commercials. Optimists own garbage cans. Pessimists own garbage can\u2019ts. I hope the new \"Scooby-Doo\" reboot is a dark, gritty exploration of Scooby's homicidal anger towards Scrappy-Doo. It\u2019s hard to believe that Los Angeles was settled in 1956 by the Dutch. Hanging out with Ice-T (@FinalLevel), eating froyo, like a pair of bad motherf**kers. http://t.co/25XK5agtRL I\u2019m halfway through Hillary Clinton\u2019s book. I don\u2019t want to ruin the ending but I bet she kills this guy \u201cBill.\u201d A tie score doesn't feel right. Who do I taunt? My Ghanaian friends are still not talking to me. .@GroverNorquist Right on all counts, Grover. And Warren Harding kicked the Spanish Flu's ass. Thanks to #CONANHAIR, now we finally know what my love child with @IceCube will look like: https://t.co/n2F9kdFy7P .@GroverNorquist Sorry, Soviet Union technically happened under G.H.W. Bush. But I'll  give you Gaddafi's tent. Grover Norquist wants to rename the Redskins, the \u201cWashington Reagans.\u201d So they\u2019ll at least be able to beat Grenada. .@KevinHart4Real and I are ready to star in a reboot of \"Lethal Weapon.\" (I'm Murtaugh) http://t.co/JPVgPi5SE2 Still no luck starting this new scooter powered exclusively by Kanye West\u2019s humility. I sure hope the paparazzi got a flattering shot of me eating dry Cheerios in that T.J. Maxx parking lot. Today we settle our age old feud with Ghana. Let's go #USMNT! http://t.co/yxQ6hEFPdT #WorldCup2014 For Father\u2019s Day, I\u2019m going to bring a smile to my Dad\u2019s face by calling him and pretending to be one of my other brothers. Guys named Guy must hate it when people pronounce their name guy. World Cup Soccer in Brazil: come for the action, stay because you\u2019ve been murdered. People are excited about my sneak peek of the new #SuperSmashBros and I honestly don't know why: http://t.co/R9hmRcJcqc #CluelessGamer Tonight on my show, I welcome a true friend and incredible musician. http://t.co/gt1rnQbBwD Reality Check: I was around in 1973 and saw absolutely no signs of X-Men from the future. .@ChanningTatum &amp; I make a perfect team. I think this is the 22 Jump Street people want to see. (Sorry @JonahHill)  http://t.co/72pHZouFFX Thinking about Tracy Morgan and his family today.\u00a0Hoping for a fast recovery for this sweet and uniquely funny man. I\u2019m a committed vegan, but only between meals. A Mylar balloon is just a regular balloon that had work done. According to a new study, narcissists use Twitter the most. Please RT. In @Rihanna\u2019s defense, all her other see-through dresses were at the cleaners. Game of Thrones Spoiler Alert:\u00a0Last night's episode contained violence and some nudity. I'm so excited--our male summer intern outfits have just arrived! http://t.co/NqXrl8q521 Trying to come up with a metaphor for the pointlessness of life, but this hamster in a wheel is distracting me. Though I support #freethenipple in theory, I haven\u2019t seen my own since a 1982 Yes concert. #idressinthedark I\u2019d love to make jokes about the Keystone oil pipeline, but the Koch Brothers still have my dog. The #WHsciencefair is a great way to make it to the White House without having to go through all of those messy elections. Took my son out to play catch and, my God, he fell into a time machine! http://t.co/fktw85iBPt On this day the Battle of Haarlemmermeer, a naval engagement during the Dutch War of Independence, was fought. #didntneedwikipedia Here is my one sentence, all-purpose commencement speech: Now get out there and do stuff until you die! The Spurs have the best team/lamest name ratio since the Davenport Shoelaces. Last night I reviewed the game #WatchDogs. Spoiler alert: You need to know how to use a controller: http://t.co/lT9tbm6PyJ #CluelessGamer I like a ladybug in the streets and a bedbug in the sheets. Dating sites are getting so specific - I just signed up for http://t.co/SBCv6rsE6T. See the \"#Kingsman: The Secret Service\" trailer on #CONAN tonight. I can't believe I lost the lead role to Colin Firth. Again. The next Jurassic Park movie should take place on an island where they\u2019ve revived a working Blockbuster Video. Overheard Tom Brady brag that he just had a Brazilian who'd just had a Brazilian. My Starbucks name is dirtier than my porn name. Just saw @JamesFrancoTV and Chris O'Dowd kill it in \"Of Mice and Men.\" I'm on the left: http://t.co/OZuT6Wsrvd I\u2019m being blackmailed by my mistress. She\u2019s threatening to tell everyone we only get together to play Jenga. I believe it was Horace Greeley who once said, \u201cNever quote an obscure historical figure in a tweet.\u201d My cousin asked me to Tweet about his Hootie and the Blowfish tribute band. Blowie and the Hootfish. I said no, of course. For Mother\u2019s Day I\u2019m giving my wife the one thing she wants from me: space. Several of the women on my staff call me \"Creeper.\" This is a Minecraft thing, right? Most people don\u2019t know that the \u201cS\u201d in Harry S. Truman stood for \u201cSharktopus.\u201d Happy Teacher Apprecciatiuon Week. Performed tonight for President @BarackObama on behalf of an amazing organization:\u00a0http://t.co/IkugWVHVxI I generally don\u2019t condone grave robbing, but sometimes a guy just needs a new pair of shoes. Happy Cinco de Mayo! If your Mariachi band didn\u2019t book a gig today, you may want to explore new management. Happy Cinco de Mayo everybody! I know it\u2019s a day early, but typing requires fine motor skills I won\u2019t have tomorrow. I was just informed that I no longer need to yell \"SPOILER ALERT\" when describing old \"Columbo\" episodes. April showers bring May flowers and Mayflowers bring small pox. Rob Ford has to stop hanging around crack-activated cameras. My daughter is afraid Mickey Rourke is hiding under her bed. I guess it\u2019s possible. Going to check. Yup, he\u2019s there. Just saw a guy driving a Tesla while wearing Google Glass and blaring Daft Punk. Now THAT\u2019S how you overcompensate. I know it's early in the season, but so far my Game of Thrones \"murder bracket\" is intact. I'm frequently told that I resemble someone's best friend who still likes ska. You have to get up pretty early in the morning to catch me using a cliche. I may be off the air on TV this week, but check out my work on the CB radio band as \"Gingey, the Truckstop Whore.\" Just benched 300 (sat on a bench, watched \"300\").\u00a0 Saturn just gave birth to a moon. I'm pretty sure she\u00b9s not a single parent, because she has a ring. Let\u00b9s face it, anyone named Captain America should be overweight and have a porn addiction. Camped out at CVS so I can beat the rush for half-priced Peeps. On the Seattle ferry and Mark proposed to Jo right in front of me. The three of us will be so happy together! http://t.co/7T9TjH12gR Who painted these Easter eggs? BANKSY!!! Babies are being named after \"Game of Thrones\" characters?\u00a0 What parents would name a baby after a sword wielding, mythological character? I sense there is a plan to commemorate my birthday with an equestrian statue on the Washington Mall and I approve. Just found out that you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him look at alarming statistics about beach erosion. Ah, springtime in LA, when the birds return for pilot season. Tonight I am X-CITED to have the X-CLUSIVE final trailer for \"#XMEN: Days of Future Past.\" 11/10c. It's X-MAZING! I thought that hosting the MTV Movie Awards would guarantee they spell my name right on my security pass: http://t.co/Lw8UW7z0Ug I had a blast hosting the @MTV #MovieAwards tonight. Thanks to the 49 friends who helped me out: http://t.co/lHrxDV9OnX I've spent a good chunk of the @MTV #MovieAwards inside this flaming popcorn. I'm now 7% butter. http://t.co/uQwsuB16zf Tonight the stage is actually on fire at the @MTV #MovieAwards. FYI I'm cooking a lamb shank over the \"I\" in \"MOVIE.\" http://t.co/MzGdxRW3pL So much amazing art backstage at the @MTV #MovieAwards. For instance, here's a replica of Rodin's \"Pull My Finger.\" http://t.co/J5UwkjKOpC As host of the @MTV #MovieAwards tonight, I pledge to stay completely impartial. http://t.co/jjBQWsW46l My name is Conan and... I'm into Thor cosplay. @MTV #MovieAwards http://t.co/jVMCAOmdOo Just finished watching the most emotionally powerful film of the year. #MovieAwards http://t.co/CESijgNFAs I've taken over @MTV for 1 hr. Ask me anything NOW! Unless it has to do with British naval history; that's my blind spot. #AskConan About to binge watch every @MTV #MovieAwards nominee in one sitting. Wish me luck! http://t.co/DyGkxUTKnN Tomorrow\u00a0I take over @MTV\u2019s Twitter from 3:30-4:30ET. It\u2019s the first step in my plan to get cast on @MTVTeenWolf. #MovieAwards. Hey @MTV - these #MovieAwards screeners you sent don't work! http://t.co/H7FNXvRUww Getting ready for the @MTV #MovieAwards with my all-time favorite movie snack. http://t.co/tpXEGzQ5hR Great acting in \"Noah.\"\u00a0 Giraffe #2 was incredible. \u201cMeredith Vieira covered in garlic aioli\u201d is my most vowel-heavy sexual fantasy. I just had an epic Italian meal in New York.  Go here ASAP.  http://t.co/cUOGM5WjnE Texas: Thanks for a great week of shows and food. I haven't had that much meat inside of me since that one experimental night in college. See Charles Barkley solve one of life's greatest mysteries: Which of us has the bigger head. http://t.co/Yv4VhlHffz #ConanDallas Tonight, on my final night in Texas, I'm bringing back one of my greatest inventions: http://t.co/hxNsOlQeZ6 #ConanDallas Confession: I don't understand how photobombs work, @SimonHelberg. http://t.co/50EottOhU4 #ConanDallas Tonight on #ConanDallas, @AndyRichter and I did this. If it's wrong, I don't want to be right: http://t.co/GvFeTxpRf5 Aw, @SethRogen brought me the traditional Texas gift, \"an aluminum tin of room-temperature beans.\" http://t.co/VNrkYAEJuY #ConanDallas .@AdamSandler agreed to be on #ConanDallas tonight only if I let him give me a \"Texas Titty Twister\": http://t.co/OZGGrbGFpc During #ConanDallas, we\u2019re gonna rope a steer, shoot some tequila, then pick up a damned mean clutch purse at @NeimanMarcus. Everything\u2019s bigger in Texas, so while I\u2019m here I\u2019m updating my dick pics. It just struck me \u2013 Wolf Blitzer is just a serious-looking dandelion. Spring is officially here, so I can finally binge watch TV outside. Quiznos filed for bankruptcy protection? So where are all the people who never ate there not going to eat? I invited @IFCPortlandia's Fred and Carrie into my blanket fort before tonight's show: http://t.co/CWoNPLVwe4 I\u2019m worried that \u201cCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\u201d is just going to be 2 hours of him posting Polar Vortex photos on his Facebook page. To be fair, I'm pretty sure Crimeans probably can\u2019t find Los Angeles on a map either. We need to deal with Putin once and for all... Send over our sharpest improv team. I think what pushed Fred Phelps over the edge was the opening of \"300: Rise of an Empire.\" Fun fact about me: when I panic, my voice pitches down to a smooth mellow baritone. I\u2019m lovin\u2019 my new Treadmill Bed! Just Googled 47 products I would never buy, just to see how fast ads for them pop up on my Facebook page. Terrible climate, centuries of oppression, and the gene for alcoholism. Or as I call it, \u201cThe luck of the Irish.\u201d Everybody is Irish on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, which must make it a living hell for Irish Immigration officials. So sad to hear David Brenner passed. He was a frequent &amp; always hilarious guest on my Late Night show. He will be missed. Do you think Putin just misunderstood the term \u201cMarch Madness\u201d? An artist puking on @LadyGaga is national news, but no one cares that I drooled on @SofiaVergara? Wife really wants to see \u201c300: Rise of an Empire.\u201d Doesn\u2019t she know those hunky actors are playing fast and loose with historical facts? Taken right before @AaronPaul_8 taught me how to tie a tie: http://t.co/WxxTAPOJ5O Forbes released the list of the richest billionaires. Kinda makes you feel bad for the poorest billionaires. Massachusetts just banned upskirting. So I guess I won\u2019t be coming home for Easter after all. I want to make sure I win if I'm ever on \"Celebrity Jeopardy.\" http://t.co/T7x6IrzB7K Sunday was Daylight Savings Time, so I gained an hour of sunscreen. Driving near Fort Worth, Texas. Best slogan ever for a restaurant: http://t.co/N71bM13BVY I would love to write \u201cAs Seen On PBS\u2019s Antiques Roadshow\u201d next to this convenience store hot dog. My son asked me what happens when you die, and I said, \u201cI\u2019m watching Chopped, just google it.\u201d I'm excited to host the MTV #MovieAwards on 4/13! I was going to say no, but @Harry_Styles begged me. Please don't ask him to confirm this. Pope Francis's humility reminds me so much of my own. I just found out my autocorrect has been programmed by John Travolta. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of spilling dip at Oscar parties. #Oscars2014 My guests next week are James Spader, Bill Hader, Ralph Nader, and Darth Vader. Please watch the first-ever @WhiteHouse Student Film Fest @ 3:30 ET: http://t.co/pzz6rtlbRW. I don't need another audit. #WHFilmFest Just took the kids to see Philomena in 3D. I can\u2019t drink Muscle Milk anymore because I discovered my body is muscle intolerant. We\u2019re going to Dallas in late March. I\u2019ll show those women what big hair is all about. I find all my best babysitters on Tinder. Just once in my life, I\u2019d like to know the sweet satisfaction of finishing a tube of ChapStick. Whenever my children call me \"Father,\" I feel like I'm about to be murdered, in black and white. Just took one of those \u201cWhich Movie Character Are You?\u201d quizzes and found out I\u2019m the plastic bag from American Beauty. How much does Ira Glass charge to narrate a sex tape? A new study shows on average, men\u2019s brains are larger than women\u2019s. But the extra space is filled entirely with barbecue sauce. Watching that new Irish hoarding show, where they clean out a man\u2019s lifetime accumulation of slights, rebuffs and resentments. Tonight I fanboy out with @MelBrooks about one of my comedy heroes, Sid Caesar. Also, I make an apology for using the phrase \"fanboy out.\" .@sethmeyers That's not a janitor's closet, that was my dressing room. As the only man alive who\u2019s hosted The Tonight Show &amp; Late Night, I want to congratulate @JimmyFallon &amp; @SethMeyers. They\u2019ll both do great! Wow. Strippers get angry if you make it rain Bitcoins. A prehistoric village has been unearthed in Miami. Experts say the indigenous people ate fish and small game at around 4 in the afternoon. A survey found that, on Valentine\u2019s Day, men spend $87.00 more than women. I.e., a survey found that, on Valentine\u2019s Day, men spend $87.00. Saw this Sid Caesar sketch when I was a kid. It made me want to make people laugh: http://t.co/Cm9UNBodP8 I\u2019d like to retire somewhere warm, like Sochi. I just found out the \u201cL\u201d in Samuel L. Jackson stands for Laurence Fishburne. Still no interest in a reunion of my old Irish-American boy band, Pale By Comparison. Americans now read Facebook more than the Bible. I guess nobody wants to read about a guy who could only come up with 12 friends. I love to go up to Spanish people and say, \u201cany FLANS for the weekend?\u201d They love that. \u00a0Still holding out hope that \"Blending In With a White Wall\" will become an Olympic event. Can't wait til Sunday to see the cast of @WalkingDead_AMC? Watch #CONAN tonight. Spoiler alert: I eat two of them. http://t.co/xvQ4GlMdEl Here I am getting my usual pre-show facial for the cast of @WalkingDead_AMC on #CONAN tonight: http://t.co/kxwinml1r1 Watching luge always makes me want to go outside and not luge. Just read a study claiming dogs can feel love, which is yet another way dogs are superior to cats. And comedians. After seeing that commercial with the horse &amp; puppy, my kids wouldn\u2019t stop bugging me. So I caved and bought them a case of Bud. Download the #NewU2Song 'Invisible' for FREE now and $1 goes to support @RED's fight against AIDS. http://t.co/B55BEqDKWM #U2Invisible My Super Bowl tradition? Watching the game at a Hampton Inn with a drifter. A bridal shop is now using female mannequins that have back fat. They\u2019re right next to the male mannequins that have second thoughts. It's the return of Puppy Conan. His wig looks better than mine. http://t.co/PsR3iROusK Queen Elizabeth is in financial trouble. How do you go broke when your face is on the money? At this time, Eva Mendes and I ask for privacy about our burgeoning relationship. Thank you. Anyone else still quietly mutter \u201cchoo-choo\u201d when they bring their fork to their mouth? Me neither. I wish a wall mount was as dirty as it sounds. I hate the Paparazzi, always photographing me when I\u2019m with my family or searching through Nick Jonas\u2019 trash. Just saw Her. (Not the movie, the capitalized object pronoun.) Just read part of an incredible synopsis of an article about Attention Deficit something or other. Someone captured the moment when I pitched Wayne Gretzky my new nickname: \"The Other Great One\": http://t.co/JgrX7qzdN5 The Toronto City Counselor says that Mayor Rob Ford is unable to change. I imagine he means out of that suit. Just snaked my bathroom drain and pulled out an Ewok. When someone calls me pretentious, the white gloves come off. That last episode of \u201cSex Sent Me to the E.R.\u201d got the color wrong on my Speedo. Did you know the Broncos have an entire coaching unit solely dedicated to containing Tom Brady\u2019s handsomeness? When the phone rings at Meryl Streep\u2019s house, do you think she says, \u201cDon\u2019t answer it, it\u2019s just another one of those Oscar nominations\u201d? You asked for it, here it is: Outtakes of @KevinHart4real, @IceCube, and me trying to score weed: http://t.co/wj6GQSTZlw Nigeria\u2019s leader has banned same sex marriage. I\u2019m not sending their prince any more money. Very excited @WBHomeEnt is releasing the Batman '66 Complete TV Series in 2014! The seat smells like Adam West: http://t.co/cqWjlpW1Gn A kid in New Jersey is falsely claiming to be my illegitimate son. For the record, I have three children: Neve,  Beckett, and @RonanFarrow. Last night, I was reading \u201cBridge to Terabithia\u201d to my kids when Chris Christie showed up and shut it down. Dreamt that I bought some new boots and a sturdy umbrella for the Morton Salt girl. Don\u2019t hate the playa, unless he\u2019s playing lacrosse. Fox News is starting a channel for children. It\u2019s going to call President Obama a \u201cSocialist Kenyan Muslim With Cooties.\u201d Kim Jong Un &amp; Nicolas Cage have birthdays this week. So happy birthday to a madman unleashing terrible things on the world, and Kim Jong Un. If Chris Christie had blocked people from entering New Jersey he\u2019d be a hero. When I\u2019m in Colorado, ladies, it\u2019s not just Mountain Time, it\u2019s mountin\u2019 time. My God, how do I delete this tweet? Nothing attracts paparazzi like filling your grocery cart with Oat Bran and Charmin. Writing a cookbook for sharks was a waste of my time. Anyone else lie awake at night wondering how to steal Jason Bateman's likability? FUN FACT: Each new member of One Direction is grown humanely at Direction Labs facilities, using only the finest polymer-based additives. I\u2019ve already broken my New Year\u2019s Resolution to not camp out on Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s driveway. One sign the economy\u2019s picking up: It\u2019s reportedly just recently gotten \u201cless hard out there for a pimp.\u201d January is named for actor Jan-Michael Vincent, who was famous for exactly 31 days one winter. New Year\u2019s Eve is just a made up holiday created by the taxi industry to get more vomit in cars. Friends are asking about my New Year\u2019s plans, but drinking off-brand gin &amp; browsing http://t.co/5PN4QhsFL2 isn\u2019t really something you plan. I consider 2013 a pretty good year for me because I didn\u2019t appear in any pistachio commercials. \u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d is actually Scottish for \u201cGod, this haggis sucks.\u201d The sights and sounds of Christmas in Boston! http://t.co/aI1KYr787K It\u2019s amazing how fast the gift of a Hickory Farms taffy log can be turned into a weapon by an unappreciative wife. I\u2019m pretty sure Santa used my bathroom when he was here last night. There\u2019s nothing like the look of wonder on a child\u2019s face on Christmas morning when he doesn\u2019t get anything. Every Christmas, I tell my family the same thing: \u201cI don\u2019t need presents. Just the love of millions of strangers.\u201d My son loves LEGOs, so for Christmas I got him the Goodfellas playset. Paul Sorvino is over 300 pieces. Yet another Christmas without a special Flavor Flav box set. What the song doesn\u2019t mention is that Santa checks EVERYTHING twice. He has OCD. I\u2019ve been banned from the American Girl Store. Here\u2019s why: http://t.co/XGVnNAe1OO Gift cards: the best way to say \u201cHere. You figure it out.\u201d I have the scoop of the century: @TomHanks reveals his acting technique from \u201cBosom Buddies.\u201d http://t.co/wxoUrY0DDF Presidential Pez dispensers! http://t.co/YdpaCfaCHZ I still remember the first Christmas present my parents ever gave me. It was an iPad. Last year. Photo Christmas cards: making husbands ask \u201cWho are these people again?\u201d since they were invented. This Christmas, I am giving everyone on my staff three seconds of eye contact. Who says LA doesn't understand the real meaning of Christmas? http://t.co/f4wHsYOUnr .@IceCube, @KevinHart4Real &amp; I made a random @Lyft driver take us on a Hollywood adventure. #RideAlong or die, bitch! http://t.co/xQNcwVgelr Tonight, I got to live out a dream: Showing Benedict Cumberbatch my cosplay for HolmesCon 2013! http://t.co/QUjranHc4t I\u2019m always happy whenever I hear an @ArcadeFire song, because I know some artisanal cheese can\u2019t be far away. I\u2019m almost done with my Christmas shopping. Thanks, Burger King! Phil Collins is making music again. It took him this long to decide which super close-up photo of his face to put on the album cover. Sunday, maybe the New York Jets don\u2019t actually try to beat their opponent through football, but instead through a strongly-worded letter. Jim Parsons &amp; I tore the clothes off @SimonHelberg on #CONAN last night. It was like Magic Mike, but with nerds. http://t.co/kcomftDd8m I am a better actor than Daniel Day-Lewis. Here's proof: http://t.co/4mznqH3p7h #SuckItDayLewis I don't want to say http://t.co/MkqSJ1u6kr is still flawed, but my health insurance is now being paid for by a prince in Nigeria. David Beckham said he was hazed his 1st year as a pro player. For 10 grueling minutes, he was forced to pose for photos with a shirt on. Amazon drone, wow.\u00a0Just when I was getting used to the Barnes &amp; Noble surface-to-air book launcher. #OldSchoolTweet http://t.co/n0cDKkXevw You COULD let your guests pile their coats on the bed, but you're just inviting DNA confusion if the night ends in murder. Not sure how to feel about this. My daughter's class just put on a pageant about The First Black Friday. Should I be worried that I look a lot like the woman in this dry cleaning ad? http://t.co/QuIl4w7PHO In honor of Hanukkah falling on Thanksgiving, I am going to spend dinner feeling guilty about everything I have to be thankful for. Fortunately, \"gobble gobble\" is turkey for \"I'm ready, Jesus.\" I consider myself a moral person. That's why I only eat turkeys that have exhausted the appeals process. Fun fact: the 1st Thanksgiving had lobster, venison and small pox. Today is a day for drinking beer, watching football, and pretending I don't want to kiss all the players. I wasn\u2019t going to try Prilosec, but then I saw an online ad of theirs featuring Larry the Cable Guy. R2D2 has been confirmed for the next #StarWars film. After all these years, R1D1 still can't catch a break. A new study has found that women would rather watch TV than have sex. Sort of good news/bad news thing for me. Tonight on #CONAN, Mr. @RonBurgundy sings a moving song to Toronto Mayor Rob Ford. http://t.co/fqdc7Ome6N Apparently this just happens to anyone who gets within ten feet of @RonBurgundy: http://t.co/dTkpSpMmno #CONAN This Rob Ford guy is proof that you can get pretty far just on looks and charm. This insane supercut is both a recap of #CONAN season 3 and a recurring nightmare I've been having lately: http://t.co/StisATwvgz I'm gonna go jump in that big pile of leaves. Wait, that's Larry King sitting on his lawn. Starting a Twitter feud with @Pontifex.\u00a0 Hey, Pope Francis!\u00a0 I admire and respect you!\u00a0 (Not good at Twitter feuds.) The \"50 Shades of Grey\" movie will be postponed until 2015. For \"50 Shades\" fans, that's agony - sweet, sweet agony. Bill Clinton said in terms of Americans keeping their health policy, President Obama should \"keep his vow.\" Then he laughed for 9 hours. To commemorate the 150th anniversary of The Gettysburg Address, I joined @KenBurns &amp; #TheAddressPBS in reciting it: http://t.co/XhJWMSu3Te Text REDCROSS to 90999 to make a $10 donation to help #Haiyan victims. Give more here: http://t.co/ylA5iQFCjO. Blockbuster announced they\u2019re closing all their stores. Now where am I supposed to go when I want to be alone? I was surprised to find out most of the new THOR movie takes place in a Vermont bed and breakfast. Enjoy the Twitter IPO, nerds. I'll be at the Myspace yardsale. Is it wrong to drive out to a farm 3 weeks early just to taunt your Thanksgiving turkey? .@ChrisRock &amp; I are on @BETRealHusbands tonight. I'm gonna hit that network like a ton of plain yogurt. http://t.co/VNbsJICGF8 Now that that the FAA is letting us be on our phones during take-off, I don\u2019t want to use my phone during take-off. A friend's 4 year old did this to me. I thought it was cute until I was shot at by the @Pokemon gang. http://t.co/qdPpJnnhac When my grandchildren ask me who I was and what I stood for, I\u2019ll say these 3 words:\"Money Shot Lincoln.\" http://t.co/xBciHCedgk #Conan20 Check out 20 years of classic bits on TeamCoco: http://t.co/woRCHLOtez. They are \u201cSafe For Work\u201d, depending on how hot I make you. #Conan20 \u00a0I don\u2019t like to be wasteful so I\u2019m turning all my leftover Halloween candy corn into a chowder. Celebrating 20 years on television. That\u2019s over two decades of old people not understanding my show: http://t.co/woRCHLOtez #Conan20 Watch #CONAN20 this week to see clips from my 20 years on TV, &amp; see if you can pinpoint when my \u201cprocedure\u201d was done. http://t.co/woRCHLOtez For a safe and legal hallucinatory flashback, check out these clips from 20 years of hosting: http://t.co/woRCHLOtez #Conan20 I Google-Imaged \u201cTalkshow host.\u201d http://t.co/HdogeN0IrW I wonder if a shipment of cumberbunds is called a Cumberbatch. Calling the horse races at Santa Anita today. It's going gangbusters! http://t.co/GqDBDK3Iu7 Who needs a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame when I have this outside @FordsTheatre? http://t.co/A21YAe9Jsg I thought I\u2019d seen it all, California. Wow. Gluten-free urinal cakes? Too late, @BillGates - I\u2019ve already paired up with the Winklevoss Twins &amp; Tom from MySpace. We can\u2019t lose! Recently finished my 3,000th hour on TV. Only 7,000 more \u2018til Malcolm @Gladwell thinks I\u2019m an expert. Brazil is exhuming the bodies of two former presidents. Man, how bad is Brazil\u2019s current president doing? PETA wants the Redskins to be named after a potato.\u00a0Which is my family\u2019s solution to everything. Just got nominated for my first Daytime Pulitzer. I hate to be a hypochondriac but do these pox look small to you? RT if you're going to watch #SuperFunNight tonight AND you enjoy retweeting random tweets. The folks at @Pillsbury are getting aggressive: http://t.co/HISdE7ZaYS Anyone else watch \u201cJeopardy\u201d shirtless with face paint? Congratulations L.M.F.A.O. for cleaning up at the Acronymies. Party going on too long? Go up to your guests and whisper, \u201cI hope you\u2019ll stay for my dream journal reading.\u201d I just got kicked out of the Museum of Tolerance. Wife not buying that government shutdown includes all gyms. Make room on your DVRs for tonight's new episode of #SuperFunNight. I know you can part with ONE of those serial killer documentaries. The Gerald Ford Presidential Museum is closed due to the shutdown. Where\u2019s my daughter supposed to celebrate her 10th birthday now? Just saw Gravity in 3D. Can\u2019t believe all that happened because someone downloaded iO7 on an iPhone 4. Crazy week - turns out my Dad might be Woody Allen. Over 9 million Twitter followers. 1 million more and the empty feeling goes away, right? My rear end, in Latin, is \u201cgluteus non-existentus.\u201d Not gonna worry about the neighbor who\u2019s marching around his back yard with a bridal veil on his rake. .@RebelWilson's new show #SuperFunNight starts tonight. It's like #BreakingBad, but without all the meth and killing and starring 3 girls. Halloween is just a month away, and I still haven\u2019t picked out my excuse for not dressing up. Obamacare begins tomorrow, and you know what that means! Wait, actually, no, you probably don't know what that means. Anyone else thought of chaining Vince Gilligan in a barn to make him come up with another show? A Vatican Cardinal is claiming Jesus was the first Tweeter. Also, the Shroud of Turin was the first \u201cselfie.\u201d Why can\u2019t they make meth with fluoride? I just used the phrase \u201cthrow shade,\u201d so that\u2019s over. Still early in the season, but I\u2019m pretty sure my fantasy football team is headed to the Lingerie Bowl. The guys from It's @AlwaysSunny are on #CONAN tonight, and I finally learn what it's like to change another man's tighty whities. Can't believe Bryan Cranston's fans send him erotic mail. My fans send me expired sunblock. http://t.co/5uQtn4O41v The cast of @BreakingBad_AMC is on tonight. I haven't been this excited since I reunited the original cast of \"Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody\". I have the entire cast of @BreakingBad_AMC on #CONAN tonight. Many secrets will be revealed. Miss it and you're a fool. A guy backstage at the #Emmys just told me where they get the gold statues. Fracking. The soil of Western PA is lousy with 'em. iOS7? More like iOSHeaven. #ApplePleaseSendMeAniPad Last night I played #GTAV and showed the world what a badass I really am. Now I can't get car insurance. http://t.co/RV8E00HErJ Did an entire show with @LouisCK tonight. It was really special. #GenuinelyNiceTweet The new Grand Theft Auto has already made 800 million dollars? Starting tomorrow, I start murdering my guests. Getting so tired of strangers on the street hugging me and calling me Arsenio. Here in L.A., it\u2019s hotter than something that\u2019s extremely warm. #TooHotForAnalogies I\u2019m torn because I love the new iPhone5S\u2019s fingerprint scanner, but I also want to get away with some murders. Today is Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, the day when Jews around the world ask for forgiveness for Anthony Weiner. 20 years ago today I made my TV debut. I offered the tapes to The Smithsonian, and they said to leave them out by the recycling bins. What do you tip a masseuse who constantly mutters, \u201cI always get the bony ones\u201d? Just found out Spain has its own version of SNL. It\u2019s just 90 minutes of ham tastings. I love when my kids bring me breakfast in bed while dressed as the little girls in \u201cThe Shining\u201d. Trust me, when I say, \u201cJump!\u201d, my employees say, \u201cThat\u2019s a good Van Halen song.\u201d Scientists have discovered a new shark species that can walk. It was immediately hired by CAA. The new \u201cMadden NFL 25\u201d lets you control a player's career over several seasons. I got it just so I could keep repeatedly firing Tim Tebow. .@OperaMemphis wants @CarlReiner to perform Die Fledermaus after performing on my show. Internet, Let's do this! http://t.co/l2NSyOeOrv Watched the Bronco game last night. Nice to finally see NFL guys wearing orange that aren\u2019t jumpsuits. .@Snooki is going to be on the new season of Dancing With The Stars. Question: Can Time Warner get into a fight with ABC this Fall? \"Orange is The New Black\" is proof that I wouldn't survive five minutes in a minimum security women's correctional facility. I dread the inevitable video where old people are twerking. You know it's coming. Talked to the guy in charge of milk expiration dates. He said he just uses relatives\u2019 birthdays. Happy birthday to Turkish footballer Hakan \u015e\u00fck\u00fcr! #didntevenneedwikipedia Hey, small child in China in charge of my Twitter account, don\u2019t tweet this yet. Finally reached \u201cPremier Elite Executive Diamond Platinum My Life Is Empty\u201d status on American Airlines. I don\u2019t want to tell anyone how to run their company, but how come I can\u2019t walk into a @Starbucks and order a venti Guinnessacino? I\u2019m at high risk of being victimized by revenge porn, just as soon as I can convince someone to shoot me doing porn. There\u2019s misplaced cockiness, and then there\u2019s this guy: http://t.co/PXqFsJP75T I understand Miley\u2019s VMA performance. I\u2019ve missed dozens of NFL games because my foam hand and I never made it out of the bedroom. On this day, The Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantine Army at Manzikert. #didntevenneedwikipedia .@HuffingtonPost is set to ban anonymous comments. I guess \"SexxxyGingerNotConanOBrien\" will have to move on to greener pastures. Ladies: Looking for a married man who\u2019s totally committed to his wife &amp; only allowed to talk to other women via tweets? I\u2019m your man. Remember: it\u2019s never too late to become a child prodigy. Want to meet the coolest waitress in the world?\u00a0 Her name is Serena and she's at The Elysian Brewing Co on East Pike Street in Seattle. A new study says it costs $241,000 to raise a child to age 18. However, that's mostly due to the candy cigarette tax. Elon Musk's hyperloop is happening, and Marge can do nothing to stop it. Christian Bale has been offered $50 million to play Batman. Save your money, Hollywood, I\u2019ll do it for $40 million! Shout out to Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus, who on this day in 43 B.C., compelled the Senate to elect him Consul. #didntevenneedwikipedia Apparently, Mayor Filner sexually harassed a great-grandmother. Today, Filner said, \"You can call me sexist, but you can't call me ageist.\" Ha ha, this doorstop is shaped like a Blackberry. Building a Hyper Loop to get me out of this family reunion. No matter how many Back to School sales I scope out, I can\u2019t seem to find one decent \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d lunch box. This week, John McCain was called in for jury duty. McCain hasn\u2019t served on a jury since the landmark case of \u201cMan v. Fire.\u201d Just bought Detroit on Etsy. Justin Bieber was involved in another all-out brawl. This one with Brownie Troop #152. Netflix pulled a Star Trek film after complaints about incorrect Vulcan subtitles. Also, allegations of completely fake words like \u201cvagina.\u201d Obama turned down a role in Oprah\u2019s movie \u201cThe Butler.\u201d  Instead, Oprah had to go with her second choice, German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Does anyone know if those metal exoskeletons from \u201cElysium\u201d are available at Sharper Image? Of all the thrills of my career, getting to style @Beyonce\u2019s hair is way up there: http://t.co/dgXft2j32l 32 other countries have a greater life expectancy than the U.S.  This is due to obesity, smoking and the NFL. Has anyone else noticed the Royal Baby still isn't speaking to the media? Confession time. Since 1997, I\u2019ve been writing a children\u2019s book series under the pseudonym \u201cJK Rowling.\u201d President Obama said he\u2019s urging his daughters not to get caught up trying to act like celebrities.

Just wait until the debut of Starbucks\u2019 new \u201cSylvia Plathaccino.\u201d This new Pope seems kind of cool, but I\u2019ll reserve judgment until I see his set at Lollapalooza. Last weekend, a German woman gave birth to a 13.47 lb baby. Doctors say the mom is resting comfortably and the baby is invading Poland. The Army says it plans to start using lead-free, eco-friendly bullets. Also, unmanned drones will notify their presence with smooth jazz. I was surfing the internet yesterday, when I was struck with a horrible vision of our future: http://t.co/mhdze8EtGp The United States\u2026\u2026.. is\u2026\u2026\u2026ranked\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.9th \u2026\u2026\u2026in the\u2026\u2026\u2026.world for\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Internet speed. So, the CEO of Google has a $15 million sex penthouse? That\u2019s nothing compared to my $20 a month sex P.O. Box. Just saw Val Kilmer as Mark Twain at the Kirk Douglas Theatre. He is so funny and fantastic I am bitterly jealous. Anthony Weiner said, \u201cMore will come out.\u201d Just how long is this guy\u2019s penis? Wow, Slayer\u2019s \u201cRaining Blood\u201d sure sounds less sinister on a banjo. Help kill the television industry - subscribe to my Youtube channel today!\u00a0http://t.co/DGdn2nOf5p Just got out of a traffic ticket with tickets to the show. Luckily, that cop loves \u201cEllen\u201d. Any Walmart can be a cool, smoky jazz bar if you bring your own jazz band and smoke machine. Someone please take an Instagram of this Tweet and then Vine about it. I can\u2019t decide: should I see Pacific Rim\u00a0tonight, or just put a garbage can on my head and smash it with a hammer for 90 minutes? Do I tweet my dream about Boy George, or save it for therapy? I can no longer stay silent - The screen-saver sketch of Emily Dickinson on my Kindle looks exactly like Sarah Silverman. Kinda surprised more guys don't ask me for workout tips. Just picked up a DIY MRI from CVS. Meditated for 15 minutes this morning - your sarcastic Reply and ironic Retweet can\u2019t hurt me. I seriously cannot believe that Bastille Day lands in the middle of Ramadan AGAIN. When @JustinBieber pees in a mop bucket, it\u2019s national news. When I do it, I just get kicked out of Home Depot. I didn't watch \"Sharknado\u201d. It conflicted with my DVR taping of \"ClamQuake.\" It\u2019s been a few years, so I\u2019m just wondering: is it still hard out there for a pimp? Just watched the trailer for #PacificRim, and I had a few thoughts: http://t.co/WAIVwbYEgy I suffer from the Irish curse - my penis stays out drinking all night. Baskin was Hall, Robbins was Oates. \u00a0Just threw my headshot into Steven Spielberg\u2019s convertible from a freeway overpass. \u201cOne if by land and two if by sea\u201d refers to my bathroom habits on trains and ships.

Don't mean to brag, but many women say I combine the power and presence of a Mr. Roper with the raw sexual energy of a Mr. Furley. I think the AAA Motor Club is really a cult that lures people in with friendly service, reasonable rates, and convenient locations. Watch @DeonCole's Black Box\u00a0tonight\u00a0on TBS just before my show. He's my brother from another mother. But the same father. I assume 'Escape Plan' is about Stallone and Schwarzenegger trying to escape their speech coaches. Queen Elizabeth is getting a raise, after she played hardball by threatening to take her waving and weak smiles elsewhere. Until Vladimir Putin agrees to return Snowden to the U.S., I\u2019m holding onto these sweet babies: http://t.co/Xq874Moi8W Your move, Vladimir. I hope the NFL takes steps to bring its Player Murder Rate back down to acceptable levels. Hey Supreme Court, where were you 17 years ago, when I wanted to elope with Bill Pullman? TMZ and babies both derive their life-sustenance from nip-slips. Whatever we think the future will be, let\u2019s all agree right now to never wear those tight silvery unitards. I\u2019ve found that \u201cSo, are any of you losers verified on Twitter?\u201d is not a great icebreaker at dinner parties. Over the loudspeaker, the pilot just introduced his co-pilot and his designated driver. Experiencing \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d withdrawal. Maybe if I\u2019m lucky there will be a bunch of murders on this \u201cSpongebob\u201d rerun I\u2019m watching. The CEO of Men\u2019s Warehouse was fired. He\u2019s filing a suit, an inexpensive, not very stylish suit. Just found out that \u201camazeballs\u201d is a new, hip word and not just my Confirmation name. Two things: Comedy is about being relatable and also, I\u2019m tired of the interns not saluting me. Just saw this ad in Paris. This explains what Haagen-Dazs meant when they told me they were \"going another way.\" http://t.co/SAnypC1X5U My kids bought me a \u201cWorld\u2019s Greatest Dad\u201d mug at the Sarcastic store. I\u2019m sorry to hear about Vladimir Putin\u2019s divorce, but I\u2019m happy to have my drinking buddy back. Call me, Mrs. Putin! I hope the government wasn\u2019t spying on iPhones, or they\u2019re going to have millions of records of people saying, \u201cSorry, you\u2019re cutting out.\u201d RT @TeamCoco: \"Hey, I'm really mastering this Vine thing.\" - @ConanOBrien #OneVineDay https://t.co/RdRaaexr2d Government collecting data from our cell phones?

Vince Vaughn &amp; Owen Wilson from #TheInternship have a cornhole battle with me on #Conan tonight. It's not what you're thinking, mom. And just what am I supposed to do with this warehouse full of \u201cDon\u2019t Taze Me Bro\u201d mouse pads? Played softball with my son last night. He says I \u201cthrow like a Conan.\u201d I\u2019m looking for a Franklin in the streets and a Bash in the sheets. Just woke up from a nap and discovered 18 more \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d characters have been killed. If you think that\u2019s bad, you should see how Michael Douglas got eczema. In 10 years, my wife and I have never gone to bed angry. Thanks, couch and spare pillow. Want to get slammed from every conceivable angle? Pick the bumper car that\u2019s painted like a police cruiser. I\u2019m going to be like my dad and show up to every one of my son\u2019s Little League games, but without all the betting. Pretty sure karate was invented by a guy and a bee. I\u2019m really scared of horror movies with clowns, and this theater is full of them. We\u2019re all looking for a Canada by day, and a Mexico at night. I'm tired of being discriminated against. http://t.co/W0sd0tDt0P Adultery hookup site \u201chttp://t.co/DYZJpa3LMK\u201d worries me, but not as much as \u201chttp://t.co/NGN8jmwZPC.\u201d Whenever I feel like L.A. is sketchy, I remind myself that most of its van-based tattoo removal clinics are \u201cFully Bonded.\u201d Please, for the love of God, nobody retweet this. Just had the best breakfast of my life. Sorry, Mom. http://t.co/M7vGEP8KvX I truly believe we\u2019re all in this together. Now I just have to figure out what \u201cthis\u201d is. Last night JJ Abrams showed a cut Star Trek scene of Cumberbatch showering. It was like looking at my reflection. http://t.co/IDze7b1Irv Anxiously awaiting the return of Nanny McPhee. Mark my words: on the last episode of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d we will finally get to see all the dragons naked. According to a new survey, almost 10% of women lie about the size of their breasts. Which is why I always carry around measuring tape. It took me a while, but I finally ran Barbara Walters out of show business. Out of the loop\u2026 what\u2019s all this about President Obama being worse than Cynthia Nixon? President Obama is embroiled in 3 scandals. After hearing this, Bill Clinton said, \u201cAmateur.\u201d Tonight I try out a new desk made of 100% @ImHeatherGraham. http://t.co/mHm0mUnM3g #HeatherDesk I just found out I\u2019m being audited. I don\u2019t remember joining the Tea Party. Just tried to make a Benedict Cumberbatch anagram and I now have a hernia. For fun, I sent a dick pic to Siri and she just replied, \u201cI think you meant to send a picture of a penis.\u201d You know what they say. So I guess I don\u2019t have to tell you. Happy Mother\u2019s Day, Mom! For your gift I sent you this message in a medium I know you neither receive nor understand. My version of a meltdown is spending 5 minutes angrily shouting the word, \"chambray\" to LL Bean's automated voice recognition system. According to a new poll, Kristen Stewart is now the least trusted movie star in America. Movie star? She told me she was a cattle rancher!!! Forbes Magazine named Tim Tebow America\u2019s most influential athlete. Just 1 more reason why I always get my sports news from Forbes Magazine. YouTube may start charging? I guess cats are sick of working for free. Just downloaded a cool new app that lets me use my phone as a drink coaster. No crazy North Korea news in a while. So I guess that's all solved then? I watched the Kentucky Derby and said to my wife, \u201cAll that build up for 2 minutes.\u201d Why did she give me that look? The more I learn about prunes, ichthyosaurs, and basket-weaving, the more I question my reading habits. Paparazzi are the worst. Sometimes I give them the exact time and address, and they\u2019re still late. Just saw that movie \"Oblivion\". Apparently everyone in the future is either really good looking or Morgan Freeman. Last night I wore undies with @KeshaSuxx's face -- just as the old gypsy predicted: http://t.co/LSvE9CYQGx http://t.co/TdseDO71z0 Congratulations to NBA player Jason Collins on being brave enough to admit that he\u2019s a Washington Wizard. President Obama and I had so much fun Saturday night, we\u2019re performing next week at the Toledo Funny Bone. This supermarket is replaying my White House Correspondents' performance. There is nowhere else to go in showbiz. http://t.co/7utOSefwnl Just rehearsed my routine to an empty ballroom at the Washington Hilton. The one guy unfolding chairs loved it. http://t.co/SEDqMZNUgG Just visited the @WhiteHouse press room. Lost my temper and ejected the reporter from the Christian Science Monitor. http://t.co/AADdrPzOPX In D.C. to perform at the White House Correspondents' Dinner. Practicing my opening \"Goofy Sunglasses\" bit: http://t.co/948FxoLz2N We bring #TheSimpsons writing room to my studio in the latest episode of #SeriousJibberJabber: http://t.co/sfct5mlnM6 Scientists claim that half of the world\u2019s languages will be dead by the end of the century. So I learned Klingon for nothing. All the living presidents were at the opening of the George W. Bush Presidential Library. Bush demanded to know, \"Where's Martin Sheen?\" I thought auto-erotic asphyxiation was when you strangle your car while you're having sex with it. Hey @BenFranklin... technically, the first person to be electrocuted discovered electricity. I\u2019m in the best shape of my life. Just benched twice my birth weight."}
