Turns out that video game I play where you stay quiet until the \"enemy\" gets bored and leaves is just the monitor for our doorbell camera. I don\u2019t care who wins the Super Bowl as long as Tom Brady does. Trump should represent himself at his trial like only sane and innocent people do.

My New Year\u2019s Resolution is to drink more, put on weight and use more reverse psychology. Don\u2019t want to be a downer but so far, this year feels exactly like last year. I haven\u2019t spent a New Year\u2019s Eve crying all alone since last year. 2021 is going to be like the math professor who took over for Ted Kaczynski. By popular demand, I will not be releasing the album I wrote in quarantine. Hey Pixar\u2014 Don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve paid attention for the past year, but I don\u2019t need another reason to cry.

Hear it exclusively on @Spotify @ https://t.co/Q0Tr4HD858 https://t.co/AWdEs8mWp8 I didn\u2019t have \u201crestoring democracy\u201d in my NBA playoff bracket. I spoke to @JameelaJamil in person, but remained socially and emotionally distant. Hear our conversation @ https://t.co/pfOk236hQr https://t.co/X6F6HCv45T Years from now, historians will look back on this period of American History and move to Canada. You can make any sentence creepier by adding \"consenting\" to it. \"Just two consenting adults, riding a tandem kayak.\" You know who has a good publicist? Steel Cut Oats. When this is all over, I'm going to miss wearing masks to Trader Joe's and speaking to everyone in a German accent. Can we agree? Anyone who's ironed his clothes in the last 4 months is a psychopath. I think I took the wrong pill from that Morpheus guy. It was a joy to talk to Michael Che about SNL, his approach to comedy, and that time I bought a t-shirt from him. https://t.co/pfOk236hQr https://t.co/toqEzpgkpm \u201cGrandpa Conan, tell us again what \u2018crowds\u2019 were.\u201d\n\u201cWhy the year was 2019. This was pre-Civil War 2. President TikTok hadn\u2019t even been born yet...\u201d How do I patent my weird fork that can slip under masks? IDEA: What if we just put Confederate General hats on all the mailboxes? Who\u2019s going to break it to the Red Sox that the season IS on? What\u2019s even crazier than these two speaking at the Republican convention is that their guns are introducing them. https://t.co/4KrPW3zso4 2019: Can't wait to watch Avengers: Endgame!\n2020: Can't wait to watch the House Oversight Committee grill the Postmaster General! What a joy swapping Prince stories, celebrity crushes, and SNL memories with the crazy-talented @MayaRudolph (aka @KamalaHarris). Hear our conversation @ https://t.co/pfOk236hQr https://t.co/EHqPZ2J2LP We\u2019ve been in lockdown so long I\u2019ve had time to re-learn Spanish and re-forget Spanish. Face masks should have a reflective surface, so people who aren\u2019t wearing them can see what assholes they are. Now that everyone has more free time on their hands, any chance we can finally get around to changing the name of sour cream? I just heard that most of the babies recently born in New Zealand take a moment to look around then loudly say, \"Ohhh, HELL YEAH!\" Today is the Wednesday you thought was Thursday. Money-saving idea: get rid of Mike Pence, replace with a large vanilla milkshake. I spoke with my friend @JimCarrey about comedy, truth, and his new genre-defying memoir @ https://t.co/pfOk236hQr https://t.co/0uqm3PXFc4 I\u2019m excited to announce the launch of Twatch, my new live streaming service where you can watch me assemble jigsaw puzzles. Question for the man with the medically grafted penis growing out of his arm: Are you getting more--or fewer--rides when you hitchhike? Today Dr. Fauci announced he\u2019s hopeful by year\u2019s end we\u2019ll have a release date for TENET. People are calling for the presidential debates to be canceled, but if that happens, how will I decide who to vote for? I let a jellyfish sting me today, just for the physical contact. I am still available if Joe Biden changes his mind and decides to go with a white woman. If Trump bans TikTok, what will I threaten to join when my kids don\u2019t do their homework? I\u2019ve got a new side hustle, and it\u2019s getting the hilarious @wkamaubell to be my friend. Check out my season opener and hear why he is definitely not interested. https://t.co/pfOk23nSHZ https://t.co/VF101nFdCc I can only imagine how slow Netflix streaming must have been while quarantining for the 1918 pandemic. When I cook, I only use the freshest herbs and vegetables to f*** up the recipe. Well, looks like the wife and I are gearing up for another Date Month. Have we settled on a term for all our new mask-related acne yet? Maskne? Macne? Covimples? Ladies, I\u2019m a 2-ply, washable cloth mask in the streets and a surgical n95 respirator in the sheets. I'm starting to resent the way my Postmate always says, \"Another 3-pizza Tuesday, Mr. O'Brien?\u201d Idea: we hire Jeff Goldblum to calmly talk this virus into chilling out. True Crime Podcast Idea: 'The Husband Didn't Do It'. It will be 2 episodes. Our father, who art in heaven-- what the hell, man? Wanted to watch the Chernobyl miniseries but thanks to Alexa I am deeply engrossed in \"Cher: No Bull.\" What a life she's had! Canadian border agents say \"No thanks, you diseased ingrate\" in the most polite way. Crammed a mattress into the Largo dressing room. I\u2019ve never felt like a bigger star. https://t.co/tlKLFyDujm Genuinely jealous of people who live in haunted mansions right now and get to have company over. Disney World is running a special where your ticket automatically gets you a Fast Pass to COVID. \"Let's meet for coffee\"- New Zealanders right now, rubbing our noses in it. We are living in a time when going to a museum belongs in a museum. Fun fact: Nudity is typically blurred out on TV because no one can get their genitals to sign a release form. If you\u2019re wondering how much weight I\u2019ve gained during quarantine, I just googled \u201cmale caftan.\u201d Bad news: I've been googling symptoms on the internet and it sounds like I have hypochondria. My hair has gotten so long but it still has its magical powers. https://t.co/zdGXIU7Qd4 Instead of \u201cBuyer beware,\u201d how about \u201cSeller don\u2019t be a dick\u201d? \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the statues?\u201d\n--Future scuba divers My POV from @LargoLosAngeles. Watch an all-new week of shows starting tonight @ 11/10c on @TBSNetwork. https://t.co/RZwTQGc3di Turns out the people who predicted the world ending in 2012 were optimists. And to think that this whole time, I respected Donald Trump because of his SAT scores. Strike one, Mr. President. How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck did CrossFit? My guess is more. I really enjoyed @JimCarrey's \"memoir.\" Like Jim, the book is wildly comic, inventive, subversive, and made primarily of compressed paper pulp. https://t.co/P7nnIixLzb https://t.co/tr1F0HKFoc RT @TeamCoco: \"I'm an impossible square.\" - @ConanOBrien shocks @RobLowe on a new episode of \"Literally!\" Watch part of their conversation\u2026 My first electric guitar! #TBT https://t.co/mG0j5HfKiL Just went to the doctor, my BMI is 40% ice cream. Hear @tomhanks and I discuss his new movie @GreyhoundMovie, SNL memories, and our squeaky voices @ https://t.co/pfOk236hQr https://t.co/terxMZBSDH I did it. I left my house. My first show from @LargoLosAngeles premieres tonight with guest Will Ferrell. https://t.co/CVJpPtmgnF #SaveOurStages Looks like I trained for the 2020 running of the bulls for nothing. With churches still closed I\u2019m forced to sneak glances at my watch at home. Just now remembering I left a tuna fish sandwich on my desk back in March. Not sure I like the revised MLB rules for this shortened season: first bunt wins? Odd. I'm going to be checking out @TheOutpostMovie today \u2014 very true and harrowing story of an intense battle in the Afghanistan War. I also plan to floss, but no one cares about that. I am thrilled I'm moving my show to @LargoLosAngeles next week. My family is more thrilled. https://t.co/4bAK5y3fwo This new book about Trump is sure to be his downfall. We gave Canadians a little something special for this year\u2019s Canada Day\u2014no Americans! https://t.co/LeQJAcpf7M This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Negro Leagues. In honor of this milestone, I'm tipping my cap to honor those who played and helped build the foundation for the civil rights movement. #TipYourCap2020 https://t.co/64JgI2zHmt When I was younger I used to learn a new word and then find ways to awkwardly shoehorn it into conversation. Talk about a classic bildungsroman. They say muscle weighs more than fat. During the pandemic I\u2019ve gained 9 biceps. Billboard just announced the song of the summer. It\u2019s the sound of your spouse chewing. Consider donating to @ChildrensLA's COVID-19 Emergency Response Fund to help meet the needs of patients, families, and caregivers during this unprecedented time. https://t.co/1CuMh6Pruu If you're missing the sensation of shaking a good friend's hand, I've found that a 4-day-old mango has a pretty similar feel. The upside of hiking in a face mask in 80 degree weather is I inadvertently created my own mushroom grow-house.

President Trump just demanded to see Twitter\u2019s birth certificate. My kids have started saying \"Leave Meeting\" when they want me to stop talking. Hear Russell Brand (@rustyrockets) and I argue about whether \"clear broth\" or \"synthetic saliva\" is the best metaphor for fame. https://t.co/pfOk236hQr https://t.co/fQhQyvtXb1 .@roryscovel is one of my favorite comics, and his hilarious new show \"Robbie\" is worth checking out between naps. https://t.co/AmxpaWq5dL So, that\u2019s what it\u2019s like to wax the mold off an old potato. What'd everyone else get up to today? Today, I overslept and completely missed my 2nd nap. If there is a scandal involving Christina Applegate, what would they call it? @hbomax @elmo This town only has room for one charming, red-headed talk show host. And it's you. I do believe that President Trump has been taking hydroxychloroquine. Since childhood. Troubling thought: What if these are the good old days? I booked @jjabrams on my podcast to ask him why he\u2019s never cast me in any of his movies.

Anyway I'm fine. \u201cNormal People\u201d is about 2 horny Irish teens who choose to have sex instead of unnaturally suppressing those urges so they can go into comedy. If Trump wins in November, will he blame everything on the first Trump administration? Just went down a 4-hour YouTube rabbit hole, so \"tip of the hat\" to the Father of American Beekeeping: Lorenzo Langstroth. Tonight I described a Freudian nightmare in which my dad knocks a hotdog out of my hand after a dropped fly-ball at Fenway Park.

I celebrated by taking my wife to her favorite room in the house and leaving her alone. I just think Adam Driver is getting all the roles I'd be getting if I had his talent. Cool quarantine fact: 99% of the time, the answer to \"More spaghetti?\" is yes. Someone should do a podcast about true crime. TIME Magazine just announced its Person of the Year: it's sourdough bread. L.A. wildlife really is getting brazen during the lockdown--just today I found three Hollywood Boulevard Spidermen wandering in my yard.

One thing you don't often hear: \"Hey, Dolph! No, not you, the other Dolph!\" I'm going on tour and bringing some friends with me. Pre-sale tickets for my @nycomedyfest show on 11/8 at the @BeaconTheatre are available now with code: TNYCF https://t.co/xEDTBsVAMr https://t.co/qnYQ00TbVn I\u2019m taking Intro to Fortnite at the local community college. (That\u2019s how Ninja did it, right?) I\u2019m starting a podcast about comity, it\u2019s called What The Heck. Okay, yep, that's on me, he got me good! (I just found out the recycling bin I've been using for 3 years was really @SachaBaronCohen all along.) There's going to be a movie about this whole MoviePass - nevermind it just lost funding. For the record, I don\u2019t want Rudy Giuliani doing my eulogy. I\u2019m taking comfort from the fact that those plans for making 3-D plastic guns were written by IKEA. I just got instructions for how to print a 3-D \"Pandora's Box.\" I don't know. Are we sure that was the LAST Airbender? Just got a pool floatie shaped like friends that want to come over and hang out with me. My son just came home from robotics camp. At least, I think that's him. Around the third sangria, the women catch on that nobody invited me, but by then I\u2019m off to the next book club. When I was a kid at sleep away camp, I still remember how exciting it was to get a letter from my Mom and Dad's attorney. When I grill burgers, I take a tip from the restaurant guys and, at the last minute, sprinkle in just a hint of e.coli. I thought the Shazam movie was about a superhero with the power to guess the name of any pop song. I truly hope there are people in France who believe that, in America, LeBron is known as TheBron. Just noticed the poster for Mamma Mia 2 features as many people of color as a poster of me. These are the best Spanx I've ever worn. #ConanCon https://t.co/Ar7QgoFkYR I love it here at Comic-Con. I\u2019ve got the entire Gotti panel to myself. #ConanCon I have X-ray vision, but it only works on objects wrapped in very thin tissue paper. #ConanCon At any given point during Comic-Con, San Diego is the #1 place on the planet for tights drying in hotel bathrooms. #ConanCon I got my hands on the Batgirl audition tapes. @Nick_Offerman has this one in the bag. #ConanCon https://t.co/b8ZSqBDS8q Comic-Con's the best - I've already seen a Batman, a Superman, AND a Spider-Man, all trip over a Bird scooter on the sidewalk. #ConanCon I'm a better Batman than Christian Bale and Michael Keaton combined. https://t.co/Ft8tX7YC62 I love Comic Con. Just saw Thanos arguing with hotel front desk about not getting an ocean-view room. #ConanCon I just saw two Rocket Raccoon cosplayers fighting over a Princess Leia wig! Oh wait those are real raccoons fighting over a Cinnabon. #ConanCon Is it me or is Putin riding Trump like an e-Scooter? Sure, everyone loves Chewbacca - unless you\u2019re the guy who has to keep coming over to snake out his shower drain. #ConanCon As a kid, I knew I was in trouble when my Mom would say \u201cConan Christopher O\u2019Brien\u201d through the megaphone she borrowed from the SWAT team. Song Titles (Are Cooler When Part of the Title Is In Parentheses) Every father wants to hear those precious words: \"Daddy, I won the lottery.\" Decades ago, James Brown tried to warn of our jobs being taken by sex machines, but would we listen? Elon Musk didn\u2019t save the Thai soccer team, but he will put them on a Tesla waitlist. It\u2019s so hot out I keep dunking my head into my relationship with my father. If someone ever body shames me I'm going to clap back. God, I'm lost. Musicologists now believe Beethoven wasn\u2019t really deaf, he just pretended to be to avoid hearing Schubert\u2019s boring stories about his fraternity pranks. One of these Sundays, I\u2019d like Pope Francis to say \u201cGod\u201d the way the FIFA announcer says, \u201cGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL!\u201d With the kids off at camp, my wife and I finally have some precious time to check Facebook in separate rooms. After four margaritas, I call it Cuatro De Julio. In the new James Bond movie, Bond apologizes to women for his behavior and is never seen again. About to peel an orange. AMA Does it help the environment if I drink vodka out of a reusable water bottle? I\u2019d like it to be on the record that I was making \u201cPaul Rudd\u2019s penis is ant-sized\u201d jokes LONG before he ever played Ant-Man. Step on this little raised platform and I will guess your weight with astonishing accuracy. Stove Top Stuffing is my favorite side-dish that sounds like a Midwestern porn video. Don\u2019t mean to brag, but my latest colonoscopy is getting 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. One sensuous glance and I knew: she was waiting for my coffee order. I will pay for a remake of the remake of The Last Jedi, starring only corgis. Meek Mill would also be a good name for a factory that grinds up gentle folks. Is it bad that Hereditary made me feel a lot better about my childhood? No matter how bad things might seem right now, at least we still have Nick Offerman\u2019s insane giggle: https://t.co/FPy37tBjAm A little fact about me: \u201cI can hold my pee all night\u201d was my least successful pickup line. Either I was a terrible NBA coach, or my players just weren't good enough to run my patented heptadecagon offense. I just saw 3 of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons on eBay. All I want for Father's Day is for my kids to stop calling me \"Not-Dwayne-Johnson.\" I\u2019m still confident Tiffany Haddish will not reveal what I did at a party to Steve Martin. One big perk of being part of the new AT&amp;T/Time Warner family is I now have access to the exclusive FIFTH bar. There's no one I'd rather go Super Saiyan with than @RonFunches. https://t.co/w9pzicAGwp #CluelessGamer #DBLegends My goal is to be featured in a piece about celebrities called \"You'll definitely believe what they look like today\" Thank you to @ProdevHaiti and my young friends at Ecole Nouvelle Zoranje for sending me this beautiful mural. https://t.co/4LmbnRYNqL After I retire, I want to move to Vermont and confuse visitors by opening a \u201cBed OR Breakfast.\u201d Hard to believe that it used to take days, even weeks, to call someone you disagreed with \u201cHitler.\u201d Hats off to the team of puppeteers who control Rudy Giuliani\u2019s facial expressions. President Trump and Kim Jong Un reportedly have different ideas of the word \u201cdenuclearize.\u201d It\u2019s just like \u201cLaurel vs. Yanni\u201d except with the whole planet at risk. Great news, my mom just called to say Scott Pruitt bought a broken ottoman from her garage sale for $275,000. RT @ConanOBrien: @nickkroll @NickKroll That's weird, look what I just found in my potato. https://t.co/4PATZi2xCl @nickkroll @NickKroll That's weird, look what I just found in my potato. https://t.co/4PATZi2xCl To make my grandfather proud, every June 6th I storm the beach at Malibu. In a show of solidarity today, I baked a cake for my friends who are a gay couple. It was terrible and they threw it in the garbage. Ever go to Starbucks in the late afternoon and see that one slice of lemon poppy seed loaf alone in the display case? That\u2019s what my twenties were like. One of Jesus's greatest miracles?  He was a carpenter, but He didn't bring it up every time you met Him. America Ferrara had a baby. I\u2019d like to see Trump \u200b\u200bclaim that kid wasn\u2019t born in \u201cAmerica.\u201d I can\u2019t tell you how much I\u2019ve enjoyed hikin\u200bg the Appalachian Trail these past 22 days with Melania Trump. I did not know that \"prison reform\" was something I could talk about with Kim Kardashian. Trump! Right? Wow. &lt;--- just RT this when applicable. There's nothing worse than people online who feel they can just command others to discuss a topic they bring up. Discuss. So there's going to be a Boba Fett movie, but still nothing for that show-stealing temptress, the Thala-Siren?!? https://t.co/ujBBPcwQ08 I can't find anyone to see Solo with me this weekend, so I guess I'll be flying\u2026alone. I can finally rest easy knowing that https://t.co/eTwLq6ckgg has updated their privacy policy. My wife\u2019s new nickname for me is \u201cPrince Harry if I squint.\u201d I never get more than halfway through my sci-fi movie pitch before my therapist says, \"our time is up.\" I played #TheShow18 with fellow great athlete Aaron Judge (@TheJudge44). #CluelessGamer https://t.co/1dq02U7Egi It is a time of turmoil. It is a time of confusion. It is a time of great tidings but also of grave misgivings. It is a time of upheaval but also a time of downheaval. It is a time of tweeting while drunk on Pinot. The only thing keeping me from starting my own doomsday sex cult is that I look terrible in sunglasses. Can we make ie and ei interchangeable so that no matter what, I never misspell recieve? Doesn\u2019t every single picture of Michael Cohen look like he\u2019s saying, \u201cOh, we\u2019re not allowed to do that?\u201d I'm confused - if Obama won a Nobel Peace Prize, shouldn't Trump be trying to dismantle the entire Peace Prize industry? Please no spoilers for 1)  #TheAmericansFX and 2) #TheAmericansUS, if you know what's going to happen to us. Did you know if you follow Rudy Giuliani on Twitter, it will suggest you also follow several twitter accounts promoting rabies awareness? If Trump wins a Nobel Peace Prize, I bet he\u2019ll try to trade it in for an Emmy. My Mom always says \u201chomemade gifts are the best.\u201d Hope she enjoys the meth. This Mother's Day, give the gift that says \"yesterday was Mother's Day\". \u201cWabbit AGAIN?! I\u2019m weaving you.\u201d -Elmer Fudd\u2019s wife My son asked me why I was wearing sunglasses in the house and I told him \"to block the son.\u201d Now I have to pay for therapy. When we give each other a thumbs up, it's our way of mocking every other animal on earth. Twitter has been abuzz over Selena Gomez\u2019s spray tan at the Met Gala. In other news, we may be having a nuclear war with Iran. I just heard that the emails telling Tesla customers their cars will be delayed by 2 years have been delayed by 5 years. This #July4th, show service members we have their backs. Get your #USO tee today: https://t.co/10PbjVzsEy. #BeTheForce https://t.co/KcuUi9RmcW The Boy Scouts are dropping the word 'Boy' from their name and within seconds my dad called me to say, \"Looks like they're finally ready for ya.\" I'm just sitting here by my computer, waiting for Kanye to weigh in on the Irish. I told my neighbor Greg to check out \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and now I see it's breaking box office records so YOU'RE WELCOME, MARVEL. Nothing to worry about, Trump\u2019s doctor just inspected Kanye and says he\u2019s \u201cperfectly normal.\u201d Watch Bill Hader and I fight Tron elks and bass players in #GodofWar. #CluelessGamer https://t.co/fxQryNm3T4 Farewell to Trump lawyer Ty Cobb.

I bet we can get Trump to resign with an offer of an Apprentice reboot. In preparation for Infinity War I'm watching every Chris Hemsworth movie, even the one where he plays a computer hacker, just to be buff torso. I mean safe. Ford has announced they will discontinue making the Taurus. @Smithsonian call me if you\u2019re interested in my now priceless 1992 Taurus SHO. https://t.co/w2mxTHFQE6 Steven Yeun and I in the same DMZ building where today\u2019s Korean summit took place.

As my father used to say, a frown is just a smile that's been rotated 180 degrees on its x axis, assuming the origin is located at the longitudinal midpoint of said frown. I save money on cheese by only trapping mice in a prison of their tortured memories. Alexa, stop watching me shower. I\u2019m looking for a pill that gives me 4 hours of drymouth, but with no risk of erections. I really, really, really want to see Donald Trump spell \u201cRudy Giuliani.\u201d Congratulations to @jaketapper on his new book @TheHellfireClub. It\u2019s a great read, and has way less sex than @wolfblitzer\u2019s novel. https://t.co/SVr24tRcq2 Do you think Spain knew what they were doing when they let us have Florida? No one on Earth has ever said, \"Hooray! Salmon burgers!\" An executive just emailed asking if I\u2019m available for a modern-day reboot of the \u201cConan\u201d show. New on 23 and Me: a feature that tells you if you were fathered by Donald Trump. I also paid my doorman to lie once - he told the delivery guy my order was for two people 25 years ago today, I put on a terrible jacket and auditioned for Late Night on NBC. I haven't aged a day. https://t.co/Cx2PybIS3k Hey, I found your missing straw! https://t.co/JOs6p7NOEU Catch up on today's live #ConanItaly Q&amp;A and get closer to @jordanschlansky than you ever wanted to. https://t.co/hNa9bsIyBU It\u2019s come out that EPA head Scott Pruitt has four separate e-mail addresses.

Bad news: Trump\u2019s border wall has already experienced a serious breach: https://t.co/oqcwEmjbre In Hell, the radio is only the Kars for Kids commercials. Want some juicy Hollywood gossip? After three drinks, I sometimes mispronounce \u201cCharlize Theron.\u201d I just saw a cloud that looked exactly like my father withholding his approval. Last night, the portraits of Washington and Jefferson quietly snuck out of the White House. When I was a kid I thought by now we\u2019d be living on the moon and zipping around in flying cars and sleeping in the same room as your wife. After seeing how Ivanka is treated in the press, I\u2019m so grateful I decided against hiring my daughter then asking her to constantly lie for me. Trump just made his own shadow sign an NDA. My son asked if I\u2019d take him to see Sherlock Gnomes and I told him, \u201cGnome thanks.\u201d I\u2019ve been waiting for a high-five for three days now. My son pranked me early this morning with the old \u201csledgehammer to the back of the head.\u201d At this year\u2019s White House Easter Egg Roll, the winning child gets to fire the Trump Cabinet member of their choice. The new TIME cover just reminded me that all his movies are now available ON BLU-RAY! https://t.co/ZFFMsJYY5M President Trump didn't just call Roseanne to congratulate her on her sitcom. He wanted to know if she'd be next up for Secretary of State. Coming soon to theaters nowhere: \"Due Buffoni\" starring @jordanschlansky and Conan O'Brien. #ConanItaly premieres April 11th @ 10/9c on @TBSNetwork. https://t.co/AFda32H92F The only thing I don\u2019t love about those \u201cMedieval Times\u201d restaurants is how you die at age 30. I miss the rites of spring from my childhood, the snow melting, the birds chirping, me being cut from the baseball team. I\u2019m pretty sure the audience appreciated my standing up repeatedly and saying, \u201cActually, it\u2019s PANTHER OF COLOR.\u201d I took fake Italian and real CONAN employee @jordanschlansky to Italy. Watch #ConanItaly April 11th @ 10/9c on @TBSNetwork. https://t.co/1BLYO0NZDt .@JuddApatow did a beautiful job making #TheZenDiariesOfGarryShandling. It\u2019s about so much more than a great comedy mind. Watch it starting tonight @ 8pm on @HBO. I hope President Trump knows what he\u2019s doing with these tariffs. Just had two eggrolls at Panda Express and it cost me $611.00. Saying John Bolton looks like a walrus isn't fair. He looks like a muppet walrus judge. 75-year-old Joe Biden wants to fight 71-year-old Donald Trump. The winner takes on Bob Newhart. Radiohead just beat out The Cure in my March Sadness bracket. Ben Affleck\u2019s back tattoo has given me the courage to share mine: https://t.co/hFL5G8HpQY Donald Trump, Jr. has brought shame to his family name by only having one divorce. Wow, the new President of Russia looks so much like the old President! Trump has become such a divisive figure, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s ruined that hairstyle for other men. Putin is going to win re-election in a landslide. Because his opponent is going to die mysteriously in a landslide. Read the tweet above this. Now read the tweet below this. COINCIDENCE??? Sometimes I feel bad for Melania, but then I remember she once killed another model with her teeth. The chances of picking a perfect March Madness bracket are 1 in 9.2 quintillion. Which sounds impossible, but 5 years ago those were the odds Donald Trump would be president. My new workout regimen: sumo wrestling with @KevinHart4Real.

I was born to be his stunt double. #RampageMovie https://t.co/5hMsVlyg0z Most people don't realize @AndyRichter has been a hologram for the last five years. President Trump has been consulting with Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment lawyer. The lawyer is a partner at the firm of \u201cNotta, Good, &amp; Sign.\u201d DID YOU KNOW: Hot Dog on a Stick was originally established as a warning to hot dogs who betray the King. My show is not on TV tonight, but you can still laugh and cry while watching the March Madness Selection Show @ 6pm ET on @TBSNetwork. How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if he had a CHUCK-CO Wood-a-Pult 4000? \u201cMcMaster\u201d sounds like what happens when a German guy makes up an Irish name. Years ago my siblings bought me a commemorative brick outside Ford\u2019s Theatre in DC.  Suck it, all other celebrities! https://t.co/2iOtSBIvJU Happy #InternationalWomensDay. Thank you to all the women who work on my show. https://t.co/sAFSv7YECA Netflix announced it will release over 700 original TV series and movies this year. That explains their new slogan, \u201cQuantity.\u201d There\u2019s too much news now. I just found out about the new aluminum tariff from my Snapple cap. March came in like a lion and was shot by some rich a-hole. My favorite wine is a 1965 Timothee Chalamet. I told my kids that at their age I had to watch VHS tapes on school safety, and they said \u201cwhat\u2019s school safety?\u201d If bumblebees truly do communicate through dance, what are the white ones supposed to do? President Trump will be attending Evangelist Billy Graham\u2019s funeral. So apparently, Graham\u2019s being buried at a golf course. When our kids were babies, my wife and I played them Salieri instead of Mozart, and now they\u2019ve grown into jealous, brooding schemers. It\u2019s your last chance to enter to be my co-host for a night. Enter now to help me host #CONAN and support @NEXTforAUTISM @ https://t.co/x7KrfnUufj https://t.co/ZtiKcSSJ6x I was in Black Panther. Not the movie, the live sex club in Atlanta. I was asked to leave. Watch the premiere of #FinalSpace tonight @ 10:30/9:30c on @TBSNetwork followed by my interview with creator @OlanRogers. I\u2019m available to represent Hungary in the 2022 Winter Games. Just tell me the sport and I\u2019ll start taking lessons. Trump\u2019s plan to save the environment is to arm the trees with pollution. If I could play any musical instrument in the world, it would be a violin that has twenty million dollars hidden inside it. I just went to this crazy 80s retro party where we ended up invading Grenada. They should make brownies that look like joints but contain no marijuana. I can't stand wheelchairs. Damn, I messed up the punctuation on that one. It should be: \"I can't stand! Wheelchairs?\" Mike Pence just won a gold medal in his winter Olympics event, \u201cthe frozen stare.\u201d I'd say the worst example of a retailer piggybacking on a cool movie's hype is the new Macy's campaign: \"BLACK PANT(s for) HER\" Our Italian adventure is over. Ciao for now and stay tuned. #ConanItaly https://t.co/e24oi8juyR I'm not saying everyone in LA is stoned, but a cop just pulled me over to give me a high 5.

I don\u2019t know how this happened but apparently I was just traded to the Cavaliers??? Still trying to figure out how Nancy Pelosi\u2019s 8-hour speech fits into the Cloverfield Universe. So you\u2019re telling me, I\u2019m the *only* person at this party who thought the \u201cB\u201d in \u201cBYOB\u201d stands for \u201cBotulism?\u201d Scientists have recreated the face of a teenage girl from 9,000 years ago. Careful analysis shows she died of embarrassment over something her mom did. I just found out my spirit animal is a therapy poodle. Boy, I sure hope Trump doesn't resign or anything. #ReversePsychology #WorthAShot What novelist do pirates love? Gearrrge Arrr Arrr Marrrtin. (For your personal apology, contact my office) I bet $1500 on the Eagles. The band. Do you think Janet Jackson\u2019s other breast feels like it didn\u2019t get its turn? In a fight between Devin Nunes and the FBI, who do I bet on? The group who took down John Gotti, or the guy who got his genitals caught in the zipper of his parachute pants? https://t.co/ohEPySRDry Amazon is starting its own healthcare company.

Just dealing with all of these Toys R Us closures in my own private way. FYI, it\u2019s *3* minutes to midnight on my Doomsday Apple Watch. Watch the first nine minutes of #ConanHaiti and tune in tonight @ 10/9c on @TBSNetwork. https://t.co/R56YYdnWY9 I just heard CBS is bringing back \"Murphy Brown\" which means I'll now have to sit my kids down and give them the \u201cMurphy Brown talk.\" Man, I\u2019d do anything to trade jobs with Riley: https://t.co/kUi2llFsXV I\u2019m excited to announce that I\u2019ve found my successor. https://t.co/k0u4BqFH4k It doesn't matter if I\u2019m \"solving a problem that doesn\u2019t exist\" - my point is that these tiny avocado pit cannons are just $49.99 apiece. We know Trump watches Fox News commercials because he just put a reverse mortgage on the White House. That\u2019s a wrap on #ConanHaiti! Thank you to the people of #Haiti for their warmth, hospitality and humor - and a special thank you to our excellent Haitian crew for making it all possible.

Follow me all this weekend in real time as I explore this beautiful country. #ConanHaiti https://t.co/GGmv8mtmO9 Before I travel to Haiti, I want to introduce myself to the Haitian people. https://t.co/hCaKaQDjUC #ConanHaiti Instead of checking IDs, bars now make sure that people can\u2019t name 3 YouTube Stars. If I die suddenly, in order to avoid embarrassment to my family, I\u2019ve designated a friend to destroy my enormous hidden stash of hand-painted pewter wizards. Here's why I'm heading to Haiti later this week. https://t.co/G3BqTCVy4a #ConanHaiti If you are in Washington, D.C., an exciting time to visit the White House is 1-3PM, when they feed live lizards to Stephen Miller. Still reeling from @realDonaldTrump\u2019s very negative Yelp review of Haiti, which means I\u2019ll love it. Headed to Haiti later this week to explore and make some new friends. Stay tuned for my report. #ConanWithoutBorders In his new movie, Liam Neeson is \u201ctaken\u201d in an elderly insurance scam. I know an awesome recipe for opening soup. A) I\u2019ve never been to Richmond, VA and B)  I showed you my tattoo in confidence. https://t.co/BYLgaJtSIQ President Oprah would sit down with Kim Jong-un for at least three segments. I finally finished a Chapstick without losing it or putting it through the wash. Time to die. Funyuns: not all that fun. Discuss. In LA, I have trouble guessing how old people my age are. If you haven\u2019t yet seen the movie, \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d SPOILER ALERT: Whatever shape container you put it in. The Mega Millions drawing is going to make someone an instant Republican. It's starting to look like the Russia investigation will finally bring Trump down. And by bring down, I mean get him reelected. One thing we can expect from this fight between Donald Trump and Steve Bannon: A lot of heavy, labored breathing. Personally I'm secure about the size of my nuclear button. Still waiting for Donald Trump to be downgraded to a tropical shit storm. How many people have been wrongly charged with murder because they\u2019d just finished eating a pomegranate? 2018: what could go right? Sad! This is the spread at the Mar-a-Lago New Year's party! https://t.co/fAbMMkjQtB I can\u2019t wait until 2017 is over.  And 2018, 19, and 20. After what happened to 2017, 2018 is refusing to come out of its room. A hilarious thing to do when you're waiting too long for something is roll your eyes and say \"What IS this, the Mueller probe?\" Let me put an end to the rumors: the creature in \"The Shape of Water\" is not me in hi-def. My egg nog koi pond looks beautiful, especially with all the fish resting on the surface oh my God what have I done? Happy Holidays to those of you who celebrate holidays. #Bases #Covered I love my family's Christmas Eve tradition of gathering around the piano and telling Uncle Sean to put his pants back on. I met Santa at the Macy\u2019s in Seattle. He\u2019s now suing me for breaking his femur. #MerryChristmasEve https://t.co/IEQDP6PELg The most commonly spoken phrase this week in all homes - \"Do you have the Scotch tape?\u201d Not a good sign: the first thing on Trump's Christmas list is one of those jackets like Mussolini wore. In Seattle for Christmas and there\u2019s only one way to travel: Monorail!!! #Simpsons #HoJu https://t.co/B8xBLehBuQ Stuck on a gift for Senator Mitch McConnell? You can't go wrong with body glitter. Rich people are really going to take a bath with this new tax plan. In money. They will bathe in money. Reading about the White House while watching #TheCrown. Could they, would they, consider taking us back? Want to co-host my show for a day and get your own podium next to @AndyRichter? Visit https://t.co/lRasL5jGl9 to enter and learn more about @NEXTforAUTISM. Pro-tip: do not go Christmas caroling in a Stand Your Ground state. Here comes Santa Claus, here come Santa Claus, right down the 405 until he hits the 101 which is backed up all the way to Glendale thanks to a jack-knifed trailer. All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth dipped in gold and turned into drone remotes. If the Christmas carolers at my door are really good, I turn my red swivel chair dramatically toward them. Just received Betsy DeVos\u2019s \u201cMarry Chrissmiss\u201d card. \"Stuck a feather in his cap and called it macaroni\" was for many years the textbook definition of insanity. I\u2019m not sure I agree with Roy Moore\u2019s position that \u201clife begins at masturbation.\u201d Just got picked up in a self-driving Lyft. And the driver still talked my ear off. Tonight I hung out with Chris Hemsworth, Ryan Reynolds and Channing Tatum at this cool bar called Never Gonna Happen\u2019s. Trump has been uncharacteristically quiet on Twitter. I bet his staff tricked him with one of these https://t.co/dCNTnOGtrd Just saw @mulaney at the Orpheum in Los Angeles and I have not laughed that hard in memory. I want to grow up to be that funny someday. https://t.co/NmemTUnqoN Trump just made even more people angry -- he plans to recognize Lannisport as the capital of Westeros. I prefer that other Chinese curse, \u201cMay you live in boring times, near a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts.\u201d Please don\u2019t @ me, I\u2019m on a news cleanse. I just spent 3 hours trying to solve this Rubik's Cube before my son told me it's an apple. I may need a nap. Flynn pleads guilty and flips.  Finally, the 282nd sure thing to bring down the Trump Administration. A great thing about the new tax plan - if you own a race horse, you can write off its genitals as a small business. The GOP tax plan can only be read while wearing a monocle and shouting \u201cJeeves! Wipe me!\u201d Five hundred years ago, it would take months for word of a sitcom\u2019s cancellation to reach Europe. May you live in interesting times, like when your vice-president starts picking his vice-president. I returned a book to the library today and learned they really prefer it to be a book that was previously checked out of a library. The trailer for Marvel\u2019s new Avengers movie came out today, and it\u2019s starring every woman in America. Lifehack: Get a tattoo of your face on the top of your head so there's never a need to look up from your phone. A Mormon came to my door, and after a long, emotional, and persuasive pitch, I got him to start wearing longer sleeves. Latest entry in my Gratitude Journal: \"The Altoids people didn't go into the suppository business.\" Sometimes when things go bad, I only have other people to blame. I love that. I just heard the Dead Sea Scrolls at the new Bible Museum might be fake &amp; I'm now questioning the authenticity of this \"photograph\" they sold me. https://t.co/DU2b7vKJDu Trump is already tweeting that Black Friday is the most ungrateful of all the Fridays. This year, I'm breaking with tradition a little and stuffing my turkey with delusions of grandeur. Great news: scientists have bred a turkey that tastes exactly like tofurkey. President Trump didn\u2019t pardon the whole turkey, just the white meat. This week, 90% of all calls and texts are men contacting women in their past to say, \"Are we cool?\" A few months ago while in Israel, I met a man named Ofer Aloni. He shared a moving story about the loss of his daughter and a song he co-wrote about her with @thekin. It's called \"The Power to Choose Life.\" Please take a listen. https://t.co/GWiiVDCFBF Starting to think I shouldn't have ordered a hot sauce called \"Satan's Butthole.\" I gave blood today. It's more fun when it's on purpose. I like to think of myself as \u201cThe Blind Woman\u2019s Ryan Gosling.\u201d Took what I thought was a private hike with my friend @kevin_nealon. Now I see this. Sad. https://t.co/paUFp3aarg #Lineage2Revolution cinema quality graphics will make your flat screen so irrelevant, you won\u2019t even mind when I destroy it. Download @ https://t.co/nKRv6gQSyG to play on your phone. https://t.co/LHEpNVYosw #ad Fall in LA, when the trees get work done to look like they\u2019ve changed color. I\u2019m starting to think this bobblehead on my desk is nothing but a \u201cyes-man.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure those two drunk guys with knives at the end of the bar will work this out peacefully.\u201d \u2013 (Kim Jong Un/Trump Metaphor Tweet) Me, after my Uber driver asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s Andy really like?\u201d https://t.co/KgokzRkagE I believe that when we die, we all become podcasts. I'm ready for the all-female reboot of America. Dumbest move of my life: taking a Lyft from NY back to LA. Toyota Yaris. Thanks to Will Ferrell and @mark_wahlberg for coming all the way to #ConanNYC to talk about Boston. https://t.co/dIAgFc9py7 I saw the most beautiful thing in Manhattan today: a Chase Bank giving birth to a litter of baby Chase Banks. #ConanNYC Honored to have President @BillClinton join me at The @ApolloTheater. #ConanNYC https://t.co/dQvrpFyQ6c Gorgeous New York City!

A real man should know how to order whiskey: on the rocks, in a stemmed glass, and replaced with white wine. RT @jaketapper: A cool way to help wounded veterans: watch this video about our celebrity auction! https://t.co/5ejEHEWxKM https://t.co/eNJ\u2026 \u201cThe Terminator,\u201d but he goes back in time to sleep with John Connor\u2019s mom, so he can later just keep reminding John about it. This Halloween, I served tricks over treats. I will remember the beatings for the rest of my days. The next kid who knocks on my door gets a VHS copy of \"RoboCop 3.\" Pretty excited about my Halloween costume: French Maid With Intimacy Issues Due To Her Recent Breakup With Steve. Just had a nightmare that I was Justin Turners' shower drain. https://t.co/gJ02mJrYaz This year for Halloween I\u2019m giving out Canadian passports. \"Clayton Kershaw\" is the sound you make when you cough and sneeze at the same time. Watch @AaronRodgers12 and I discuss his injury and fight off feral hippos. #CluelessGamer #AssassinsCreedOrigins https://t.co/8jn6jROBUM The only way Trump will pardon the White House Thanksgiving turkey is if it promises to do the same for him in a few months. Just saw the updated Charlie Brown special where they grind up the Great Pumpkin to flavor someone\u2019s latte. It\u2019s only the fifth inning but both the Astros and the Dodgers just left early to beat the traffic. I get off on pouring good milk down the sink. https://t.co/innOdmSjOj Just got 49 flu shots for $1.99 at Costco. It\u2019s exciting that the LA Dodgers will be playing in the World Series, unless of course their pilots get picked up. We all done with artichokes?  Yeah?  Everyone?  Full consensus?  Good. I love autumn in L.A., when the leaves change on my screensaver photos. Rest easy America, I just heroically solved the Dave the Horse crisis. https://t.co/ZiG1XMy5Br This is a terrible day to be on Twitter, please log off. #evergreen Look, Steve Bannon has a good twin https://t.co/Ee3RRlTMv5 The latest trailer for The Last Jedi blew me away, but why were the first 30 seconds about car insurance? I liked Blade Runner 2049 but its view of the future was too positive. Just read another Harvey Weinstein article and now my brain wants an Altoid. Tonight on @colbertlateshow, two sex symbols talk shop. https://t.co/h8y13GgVol Backstage for my appearance on @ColbertLateShow tonight. They told me to take a photo, so I did. https://t.co/7K4mUkaiEj The White Stripes sang \"We're Going To Be Friends\" on my last \"Late Night\" show. It's one of my favorite memories. https://t.co/EKCofdNe9h The name Red Lobster is helpful if you totally forgot what color lobsters are. Trying to binge-watch all of the Geico commercials. I\u2019m up to season 117. Got styled by #Harlem #fashion icon @DapperDanHarlem. This is the before picture. #ConanNYC https://t.co/Av6pt3ectO At @SylviasSoulFood in #Harlem today, I learned that no hairnet can tame me. #ConanNYC https://t.co/6G2dvzKncr Just found out all of my childhood bullies were Russian bots. Will box office numbers adjust for all the men who buy Blade Runner 2049 tickets then \u201caccidentally\u201d walk into My Little Pony: The Movie? It\u2019s time Dress Barn updated their name to something cool. Like, Gown Silo. I\u2019m so glad they\u2019re going to make a new Blade Runner movie every 35 years. Performed last night with the hilarious @WildHorsesShow. That face I'm making is the first sign of a massive stroke. https://t.co/5ewiX2C6BE I explored a land of moist wood, no railings, and British Orcs with @kumailn. #CluelessGamer #ShadowOfWar https://t.co/GdErFRHpO1 The most disturbing detail about Trump's new tax plan is the requirement that The Rich audibly click their heels with every million saved. I was forced to do this by those pricks in Finland. Finland if you're still reading this, I love you. https://t.co/GJtYzA0JJD Just got my flu shot. Took three nurses and a guy from the gym. I used to clear my head of the news by lying back &amp; staring at the clouds but now Trump officials keep flying through them in private jets. Now I finally get why our national anthem was written by a lawyer. Best wishes to my Jewish friends who are fasting for Yom Kippur or because they\u2019re trying to make it in Hollywood I am trying to fire my mime. It\u2019s not going well. The cops raided the nail salon in my neighborhood and discovered a better nail salon operating in the back. Hey @nickkroll and @StephenAtHome, this photo was taken the day I replaced\nDavid Letterman. #PuberMe #PuertoRicoRelief https://t.co/J1013j4rbr Reminder: If your knees are scraped and bleeding, you are playing the oboe incorrectly. I'm taking the stage at Stand Up for Heroes on Nov 7, but you can help #Give2Veterans now. @Stand4Heroes gets a dollar for every retweet. There is nothing more or less worse than when you're not unable to determinate a tweet's meaning or not. Watch me take @TomCruise for a drive and blow his mind. https://t.co/1nWMttDRaB Tonight on @TBSNetwork, I unveil a revolutionary idea with @TomCruise. Yes, revolutionary. Since the word \"brink\" gets a raw deal, I'm going to use it in a positive way: I am on the brink of eating a nice fruit salad. Help my friend @diegoluna_ get funds to those who need it most in Mexico. https://t.co/zw8PZd6JUf I\u2019m starting to regret naming my son \u201cDonald Trump, Jr.\u201d It seemed okay 11 years ago. Graham Cassidy: terrible healthcare bill, great name for a folk singer. Melania Trump may sue over this Croatian billboard. Yesterday she said, \u201clittle bit of English?

Thanks to the people of Israel for tolerating this creepy goy. It\u2019s sad to realize that those dancing gangs in \u201cWest Side Story\u201d could have just settled their differences through fighting. Thoughts and prayers go out to Lay\u2019s Potato Chips, who are clearly having a nervous breakdown: https://t.co/vt5WXXx9UW At home alone, no one here but me and Amazon Alexa. Says she doesn't want to talk. There is nothing wrong with exploring one's sexuality--and that is my message to the California Highway Patrol. You can tell the summer is officially over when my dermatologist gives the order to \u201cRetract Shields.\u201d I am now seriously regretting that time I told Equifax how old I actually was when I finally lost my virginity. Hey, wait, I thought I was America\u2019s favorite scary clown. Autumn in California, where the leaves change color if you use the right Instagram filter. https://t.co/x9vkI5DUhl Knowing me, when the nuclear bombs fall, I\u2019ll be at CVS, reading the back of a bottle of exfoliating soap. Ahora mismo estoy pensando en todos mis buenos amigos en Mexico. For a guy with a billion dollars and a cool car, Elon Musk is kind of a downer. I think I found a way to get President Trump to read Obama\u2019s powerful statement about #DACA: https://t.co/lEPIeV67O3 I won\u2019t kill you with kindness, but I will mace you with charm. \u201cFirst of all, Your Honor, I prefer the term \u2018penis portraits\u2019....\u201d Remember how enthralling and distracting it could be to play with a bubble machine on a lazy summer\u2019s day?  Can we get Trump one of those? Toda/Shukran/Thank You to my Israeli, Palestinian &amp; American crews.

Even if Big Ben does go silent, I bet it won\u2019t shut up about its new juice cleanse. Just think, 100 years from now, our grandchildren will be taking down Senator Kid Rock statues. When the eclipse comes I\u2019m going to borrow the special glasses my wife uses when I\u2019m shirtless. Once asked SNL legend Herb Sargent what's the funniest thing you ever saw? He instantly said, \"Martin and Lewis, 1940's, in a club.\" Can\u2019t we just go back to being on the brink of nuclear war? A big hello to new White House communications director Hope Hic--what, fired? I heard the iPhone 15 won't have any ports or jacks or a screen and it will just be a smooth steel ball and finally we'll all be happy. I'm leaving America during this divisive time for the relative peace and quiet of the Middle East. https://t.co/RnVTythuzI #ConanIsrael .@TheNotoriousMMA joined us to explain how he's going to \"dismantle\" @FloydMayweather. https://t.co/BHD0aP14Ld #MayweatherMcGregor On August 21st, there will be a total eclipse - which will look amazing after you miss it and see pics of it online the next day.

You call it day drinking, I call it something unintelligible because I\u2019m day drinking. There are three ways to cook a hot dog: Boil, grill, and, I just discovered by accident, dry clean. Does this man bun make my unicycle look big? I still remember summer as a child, when my parents shipped me off to camp for 12 years. It\u2019s not fair, people are getting fired so fast at the White House that I don\u2019t get a chance to make fun of them #theMooch Sooner or later, Trump is going to realize that\u2019s just a sack of potatoes in Melania\u2019s bed. People are complaining that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s wax likeness doesn\u2019t look like her, but it\u2019s a much closer match than mine: https://t.co/G13ARbcYOr Pok\u00e9mon announced that Legendary Pok\u00e9mon will appear in gyms in the form of Legendary Eggs.

Just heard Chris Christie got booed while performing CPR on a choking victim. \u201cOJ Simpson Paroled\u201d is by far the worst reboot of the summer. Trump hired Anthony Scaramucci because he thought his tan qualified him as a \"person of color.\" I miss Comic-Con so much today I went to the DMV just to wait in line. So long Comic-Con! After seeing Marvel and DC people coexist in peace, I have hope for the Democrats and Republicans. #SDCC #ConanCon #Hope No, that\u2019s not a White Walker interviewing the cast of @GameOfThrones tonight. #ConanCon In honor of tonight's #GameOfThrones cast show, @nottjmiller welded himself inside an Iron Throne. https://t.co/FPLui7M0pN #ConanCon I hereby pardon myself for tweeting this tweet about Trump wanting to pardon himself.

God Bless Adam West https://t.co/9OK7kHNZHS I\u2019m organizing a \u201ccreeps-only\u201d screening of Wonder Woman in my rented storage container. Trump wakes up every morning and says, \"Today I'll act like a president.\" But then his thumbs say, \"Oh, no, you won't.\" Tomorrow, me and 12 friends are going to an ESPN Zone to watch the former head of the FBI testify before Congress. Trump said he plans to privatize air traffic control so I look forward to overhearing my drive-thru cashier landing a plane between orders.

Dennis Rodman too. Serious question: Is there a Melania Jong Un? Let's settle this the old-fashioned way: Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at dawn in New Jersey. Trump\u2019s biggest accomplishment in his first 100 days has been making it seem like much longer. It\u2019s springtime in LA, which means I\u2019m still wearing my Ugg boots, but with short shorts. For the record, yes, I found this photo to be deeply insulting: https://t.co/xzbRAp3WbH What if the man in Edvard Munch\u2019s \u201cThe Scream\u201d is actually just singing \u201cDay-O\u201d from \u201cThe Banana Boat Song?\u201d I still don't know what nougat is.

Okay let me put an internet rumor to bed. NO, this isn't me. https://t.co/4LIbzDV4XY Whenever I think milk might have gone bad, I ask Sean Spicer to smell it. If he says it smells fine, I know to throw it out. We live in a representative democracy where elected officials are accountable to the people. APRIL FOOLS! I\u2019m not positive, but I\u2019m pretty sure one of this year\u2019s Final Four-- N. Carolina, S. Carolina, Oregon, or Gonzaga --isn\u2019t a state.

Long story short, goodbye sweet internet. I was also once thrown off a United Airlines flight for wearing these https://t.co/qgyCovqEHI One of Uber\u2019s self-driving cars crashed in Arizona. Evidently, the car couldn\u2019t stand to hear one more passenger say, \u201cBut it\u2019s a dry heat.\u201d Most of the water cooler talk at my office is millennials standing around the water cooler, saying what is this thing? If you say the word \u201clozenge\u201d 50 times out loud, it starts sounding really weird. Also, your family leaves the dining table. If I could only pick one desert island record, I\u2019d choose whichever album is most canoe-shaped. Giraffes are gentle creatures who do not kill, except when asked one too many times, \"How's the weather up there?\" The key to looking young is getting the \"right work\" done.

Weird moment during German Chancellor Merkel\u2019s WH visit when Steve Bannon sat at her feet and begged for stories about \u201cthe good old days.\u201d On this St. Patrick\u2019s Day, I can\u2019t help but reflect on all the leprechauns detained at the airport. Sean Spicer reminds me of the kid who would stuff a whole pack of Bubble Yum into his mouth just so he wouldn\u2019t have to share it. Beware the Ides of March.  Also the Promises of Maddow. Every Ides of March, I order a Caesar Salad and stab it repeatedly with a knife. The new head of the EPA just changed the name of \u201cpolar bears\u201d to \u201cbears.\u201d I should have predicted this would happen - my kids saw \"Kong: Skull Island\" and now they want their own pet Hiddleston. When is International Men-Frequently-Mistaken-For-Women Day? Movie idea: The Shining but the hotel is on a tropical island and there is free wifi and drink deals if you have a wrist band. If there was a gym in my house. I would definitely pay $80 a month to not go to it. I just got a ticket for driving while wearing VR goggles yet the cop couldn't suggest any other way for me to feel like I'm riding a dragon. Beautiful day\u2014just saw Trump\u2019s policy advisor Stephen Miller sunning himself on a rock, eating a cricket. The Syrian bread I ordered was detained at the airport.

I sent @TriumphICDHQ to President Trump's Inauguration to give the event the dignity it deserved. https://t.co/6RC9mffq3u A lot of job loss is attributed to automation. In fact, today I fired my writers because for the next 4 years, jokes will write themselves. You can really sense the unease in America. No wait I\u2019m just on a moving walkway in an airport. When you march the streets shouting with people it\u2019s civil disobedience, but do it drunk by yourself &amp; it\u2019s an involuntary 72-hour hold I dreamed I was driving 100 mph on the freeway and when I woke up I was driving 100 mph on the freeway. Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration is expected to be the most costly in US history.  And that\u2019s not even factoring in the money. The only thing we have to fear is Gerald Fear, of Sheboygan, Wisconsin. He is a serial killer. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in limits\u201d is a less inspiring creed when shouted shirtless to a highway patrolman who\u2019s just pulled you over. If we all pitch in, we can fund the removal of that little Eddie Munster-ish v-shaped hair thing on Paul Ryan\u2019s forehead.

What a holiday treat \u2014 they\u2019re offering free egg nog samples in this Chevron station men\u2019s room. How do I handle this? I got a coupon for a back rub from my gardener. Santa knows if I\u2019ve been bad or good, so he and my browser history have a lot in common. \u2018twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring.

Update on my neighbor: The pilgrim hat on the decaying Jack O\u2019Lantern has been replaced with a Santa hat Wow, the Cleveland Browns are 0-12.
