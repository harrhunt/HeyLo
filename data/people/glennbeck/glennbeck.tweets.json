At this hour it looks as though we cannot prove that the bearded man is the same man from keystone. (Neo nazis). I stand corrected until other evidence is found.

America chose a return to the failures of the past, which unfortunately may make the 1980\u2019s East Germany look like a free market success story very soon. Meanwhile, President Trump and the guys like Russ, don\u2019t care for excuses or who started it.  They are Americans who roll up their sleeves and get the job done. This is what Marxists do.  As their policies rape poorest of the poor &amp; steal from everyone else, they have to blame the effect of those disastrous policies on past admin.  Obama did it for 8 years &amp; Prez Kamala will do the same to Trump for next 4 years. Marxist see-Marxist do Now that the Democrats are in control, you will call anyone that calls for spending cuts, monsters that want to starve children. The only thing bigger than the duplicity of the left and media, is their stupidity and blind arrogance. backing huge multiple trillion dollar spending bills, most of which the American public who have been forced to be idle, won\u2019t ever see.  So, shut your pie hole on debt @washingtonpost! Meanwhile the press, who didn\u2019t see the plight of millions  forced to shut down their businesses (during the greatest economy in the history of America), in fact mocked them when they protested the lockdowns, now will claim to be their champion... Look, Republicans have zero interest in thinking about our children being enslaved to debt, but the Democrats are willing to buy $5000 toilets for their cells while printing \u2018I sold your children to the Chinese while mine made dirty bank deals with the commies\u2019 tee shirts. ...to spend multiple trillions on one proposal alone (green new deal) is upset at the irresponsibility of last administration because the debt - where the incoming was proposing even bigger bailout proposals during a pandemic - is up $2 trillion.\u2019 If it wasn\u2019t so tragic the beclowning of Dem party would be laughable. You couldn\u2019t pitch this in a script meeting &amp; be taken seriously ever again.

They call for \u201cthe Assassination\u201d of Blaze reporter @ElijahSchaffer.  No help from MSM or law enforcement.  Today, FaceBook strikes me and Blaze for sharing a zoom call with leftist org calling for ... con\u2019t 3. Then nothing.  Fox News in absolute chaos.  Called AZ for Biden, then said we may take it back, then not, while apparently what was left to count was Republican and said to be enough to at least make it close.  I have never seen anything like this. Con\u2019t 2. VA called early for Biden when state was too close to call.

It was known and enabled by the Obama White House and included &gt; 12. He has been blamed for the blood bath created by Gov Coumo\u2019s nursing home policies. They said 2 million would die.

Gee, seems that we are now in the time period they told us would be phase two, it seems as though ... con\u2019t &gt; 11. taking control of companies and telling them wha to produce, he simply asked the free market to step to the plate, because he trusts the people of this country to do the right thing. By not taking control, he is called a dictator and a nazi.   Meanwhile ... con\u2019t &gt; 10. Only to be called \u201cracist,\u2019 \u2018xenophobic \u2018 and stirring hatred.

Lowest unemployment for Hispanics &amp; blacks EVER and causing the first real growth in pay that I can remember.  @realDonaldTrump (are you still with me @BenSasse ?) then responded ...&gt; 7. @realDonaldTrump also took an economy that had been beaten down, a people who had been told \u2018you didn\u2019t build that\u2019 and in fact - Obama and Biden claimed that this economy was as good as it would ever get, we would never create jobs in sectors ever again only to ... &gt; 6. Made real in roads and open doors that the GOP was to wussy to even try to open with Hispanics and Blacks. He again didn\u2019t pander, he is stead cleared the dead wood and opened pathways up so they could get higher education, create jobs,  and not get lost in the prison system.&gt; 5. I\u2019m going to cut him some slack.  @BenSasse he also has defended religious liberty unlike any other president at least in the last 100 years,  is a true PROLIFE advocate that unlike most republicans backs it up with action instead of just talk. @realDonaldTrump has also ...&gt; 4. NATO, , brought the Arabs and the Jews together whIle smashing the choke hold of the PLO, and stood up to the Chinese instead of selling  them super computers (Clinton) accepting lead poison in dog food (bush) or loving the CCP and taking millions in dirty money (Obama/Biden)&gt; 3. Something NO president has done even though they all promised. Yes, he met with the North Korean Dictator.

He got us out of the disastrous Iran deal, killed their head of terror, boxed them in and is currently collapsing their economy while ALSO brokering a Mid East peace deal THAT EVERYONE SAID COULD NEVER HAPPEN, he moved our embassy to Jerusalem despite the state department &gt; 1. So disappointed in @BenSasse.  @realDonaldTrump  has given us great judges on the lower court, 3 judges far superior than Roberts and other bogus constitutionalists as SCOTUS and one just may turn out to be another Clarence Thomas.

Will be the first to admit it.\u2019I did. On air and personally to the president himself.But it was all about politics. I knew he loved his children and they him. What I failed to see, is the reason I think they love him. @realDonaldTrump is a loud New Yorker with a private heart 5. I didn\u2019t want to embarrass myself in the end and failed to do the right thing again.  I don\u2019t regret my doubts or expressing my concern in 16, but the fact that I missed his humanity and was blind to his family.  I said at the time, \u2018I hope I am wrong and will...\u2019 con\u2019t 4. Did I miss, the sharpness of my \u2018judgement\u2019 without consideration of family.  Me? A guy who has lived it from his side.  I wanted to end my interview with @realDonaldTrump son this week w/ a personal apology, who had spent 20 minutes with me as if we were old friends.  Con\u2019t 3. But let me cut to the chase.  I believed he actually didn\u2019t care about people.  When @realDonaldTrump called me after my fathers death, I assigned the motive to politics - AND SAID SO. What haunts me this week is how my words must have hit his children. How ... con\u2019t 2. I expected @realDonaldTrump to take control federally at the first opportunity.  Here we are in a massive crisis. Bush \u2018violated the free market to save the free market.\u2019 Trump could have violated federalism to \u2018save federalism\u2019 yet he has stood firm through COVID.  Con\u2019t 1). I am feeling so humbled this week.  I feel truly horrible for the things I said and believed in 2016 about @realDonaldTrump .   I believed the worst politically, which he proved me wrong at almost every turn. In the most dramatic cases (life/Israel/China/authoritarian) cont #RNCConvention2020  .. and then \u2018Yurtle the turtle\u2019 (McConnell) speaks.   Oof. 30 minutes into the #RNCConvention2020 #RNC2020Convention  My wife Tania said:  \u2018I am about to get a MAGA hat\u2019.   #Trump2020Landslide If Americans who are looking for jobs, Hope, and a \u2018home\u2019 where people believe in a better tomorrow, they should just see the first 25 minutes of the #rncconvention  POWERFUL.

And currently, their narrative is that America is by definition racist. https://t.co/df4LNBd5MT Some on the Left justify looting by saying, hey, insurance will cover the damages!

To New York jewelry store owner Oscar Izaguirre Jr, it was \"traumatic.\" https://t.co/SsdZaxByDD I spoke with Brexit founder @Nigel_Farage about the protests that have sprung up in the UK.

But I\u2019m a minority, too. My family and I have worked our whole lives for this.\" The question we should all be asking is where are groups like Antifa getting their money? And who else is coordinating with them? Because governments are giving them exactly what they want, including the defunding or disbanding of police. https://t.co/HnRg7SjIxL As the former mayor of New York City, @RudyGiuliani gave me his perspective on the recent riots: \"This is a DIFFERENT riot than we've ever had before in New York City!\" https://t.co/tY701iUl3w South Dakota @govkristinoem believes \"America has always been special.\" I spoke with her about how simply striving to uphold freedom and the Constitution made her response to the coronavirus so unique. https://t.co/HQtQNOQptR .@TuckerCarlson you have my support. \n\n#TuckerCarlsonisNOTARacist https://t.co/GQQ2b6SGli Today on The Glenn Beck Program I discuss the birth of a new religion.\n\nPlus @RudyGiuliani ranks DeBlasio's performance &amp; discusses the Rosenstein testimony nobody is talking about.\n\nAnd @govkristinoem on lessons she's learned governing during a pandemic.

And now, some of their demands surrounding the protests sound EXACTLY like Antifa's! https://t.co/YgVmvMFI2V There's a new insurrectionist group that's trying to bring all the others under one umbrella: the Revolutionary Abolitionist Movement. While the media still pretends like these groups are merely protesters, RAM has been hijacking protests - and POSTING about it! https://t.co/gPBppluCo4 The coordination of groups like Antifa at some of these protests is absolutely INSANE.

At least half of America agrees with the case @SenTomCotton was making in his op-ed, and the paper SILENCED it. Now the Times' editorial page editor has resigned to further appease the leftist mob. https://t.co/jVABNW9tj0 To the black Americans who feel like the country hasn't listened to you: Constitutionalists WANT to help, and believe we have a lot in common. But we must walk away from the past and strive toward the truths that we all hold self-evident. https://t.co/7RiudYUnao History has proven time and time again that it takes communities YEARS to recover from riots.
