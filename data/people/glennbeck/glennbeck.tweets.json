While the media still pretends like these groups are merely protesters, RAM has been hijacking protests - and POSTING about it! https://t.co/gPBppluCo4 The coordination of groups like Antifa at some of these protests is absolutely INSANE.

I'll bring you on the show and we can talk about, but you better bring facts because I'll be holding all of MINE. @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 41/ In her testimony, Fiona Hill said the words \"conspiracy theory\" at least twice, and at one point specifically mentions George Soros. @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 40/ He\u2019s already brought down several countries.\n\nBut the question has always been: How does he do it, and - possibly more important - are nation states colluding with him to pull it off? @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 39/  But why is it so taboo to call out Soros\u2019 involvement in the Ukraine scandal? Why is Soros \"the name that shall not be named\"? What are they so afraid of? I\u2019ve been highlighting FOR YEARS how he plays with entire countries. @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 38/ You\u2019re going to hear the name Soros mentioned a lot in the special, and because of that fact you\u2019re likely to see a barrage of people on Left instantly labeling this entire show tonight a conspiracy THEORY. We\u2019re already seeing that in the impeachment proceedings. @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 37/ There\u2019s a big difference between conspiracy THEORY and conspiracy FACT. A conspiracy THEORY is an attempt to explain or connect the dots on something, but without any hard evidence. @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 36/ It was an initiative called Public Diplomacy 2.0, and it\u2019s stated goal was to enable people in other countries to combat violent or extreme ideology. More specifically, Islamic radicalism from Al Qaeda.\n\nDOCS: https://t.co/8yKpUBW1EM @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff DOCS:  https://t.co/sstGxEPSh0 @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 35/ But this is EXACTLY what was going on under the Obama Administration, and it was all being done in YOUR name.\n\nHillary\u2019s State Department was bastardizing a plan that actually began a few weeks after Obama was elected in November 2008. @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 34/ Disruptive change. Some might describe this as CHAOS, but ultimately - for those willing to exploit it - the reward is\u2026 POWER.\nFor most of us, we all pretty much agree that regime change and stoking chaos is NOT what the American people want. @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 33/  This could provide those willing to take advantage\u2026 well, let\u2019s let Ross describe it. This is Alec Ross addressing the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine in October 2011. Watch:  https://t.co/L2DPOYbcgP @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 32/ It boils down to an observation that the Obama Administration had regarding the state of the world as it was beginning to undergo massive change.\n\nTechnological changes in infrastructure, mass media and communications were all occurring at the same exact time. @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 31/ This is Ross at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine on a fact finding mission where he was quote:\n\n\u201clearning about the local status of internet freedom and discussing Secretary Clinton\u2019s 21st Century Statecraft agenda.\u201d\n\nhttps://t.co/4lW4TnTjxf @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 30/ Ross was appointed to the State Department as the Senior Advisor on Innovation to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He first started popping up in Ukraine in late 2011.\n\nDOCS: https://t.co/HCKJZrKg1F @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 29/ Being that U.S. funding to Soros backed groups began in 2013, we started looking beyond our initial timeline. We noticed one name pop up again, and again, and again. That name is Alec Ross. @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 28/ Oh that\u2019s right. He was testifying against Donald Trump at the impeachment inquiry 2 weeks ago. They\u2019re ALL connected\u2026 and the coup is on.\n\nBut still, this begs the question: What was really going on in Ukraine and WHY? @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 27/ And the State Department official that replied with this information was Christopher Anderson. Now why does that name sound familiar?\n\nDOCS: https://t.co/JO6o885jHO @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 26/ The entire email has been redacted. Whatever Ciaramella specifically said, the State Department doesn\u2019t want us to know about, but the final email in the chain reveals the overall context: Obama Administration dollars, going through the U.S. Embassy via USAID. @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 25/ This email chain was released via a FOIA request. The first email is from the alleged whistleblower sent to all the heavy weights within the State Department who were working on Ukraine. @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 24/ That is an answer we can not find, but that is an answer that Donald Trump was asking for on the 25th phone call\u2026 and it MUT BE ANSWERED in a Senate trial.\n\nDOCS: https://t.co/J7gsJjzZ2v @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 23/ And would it also be important, or relevant, if the people currently involved in impeachment were dealing with these funds that were being given to groups like the Soros NGO? @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 22/ I pointed out in my mega chalkboard that Ukrainian prosecutors claimed to have evidence that over *SEVEN BILLION* had been misappropriated. Is this part of that, because that\u2019s kind of important here. @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden @RepAdamSchiff 21/ Why are all these State Department officials, and CIA/NSC staffers so scared of Donald Trump poking around in Ukraine? I wonder\u2026 does it have anything to do with the financing of some of these groups like the Soros funded NGO? @realDonaldTrump 20/ And if all of this isn\u2019t enough to discredit him as a witness, he ALSO worked alongside @JoeBiden when he was made the \u201cpoint man\u201d in Ukraine. It\u2019s becoming all too painfully obvious why @RepAdamSchiff doesn\u2019t want anyone talking to this guy. @realDonaldTrump 19/ He also worked directly with DNC operative Alexandra Chalupa who was tasked with working alongside the Ukrainian Embassy in the U.S. to dig up dirt on Donald Trump. @realDonaldTrump 18/ Ciaramella is a CIA analyst, and was on the NSC during the Trump Administration as a Ukraine expert. He was later kicked out of the White House for leaking information and pushing Russia collusion hoaxes. @realDonaldTrump 17/ DOCS: https://t.co/FZpu5lHjaR @realDonaldTrump 16/ They\u2019re all privy to what went down in the months leading up to the Ukrainian coup, and everything that went down from then up until Donald Trump. And this includes, if the rumors are correct, the whistleblower, whom everyone in Washington believes is Eric Ciaramella. 15/ Let me ask you this: Have you noticed where all the people who have been called to testify against @realDonaldTrump in the impeachment inquiry have come from? They\u2019re ALL career diplomats. 14/ Why is the U.S. Embassy, and by extension the State Department, working with George Soros? What do they have to gain from this relationship? 13/ Now, look at 2018. The Trump Administration halted the money from USAID. Look who stepped in to pull the extra weight - Soros doubled down. And then the U.S. Embassy resumed their funding role just as they did BEFORE the 2014 coup. 12/ From 2014 through 2017, basically up until Trump became president, the two main sources of funding came from George Soros and the Obama Administration through USAID. 11/ DOCS: Go to finances and mouse over 2013. \n\nIn 2013, just before the coup, Soros\u2019 International Renaissance Foundation was their primary financier, but the U.S. Embassy was also strangely giving them money.\n\nhttps://t.co/tvWGGmQ6oO 10/ This part of the story has sent our research into an entirely new direction, and the rabbit hole is deep.\nThe Obama Administration has been working IN TANDEM with George Soros, supporting his NGOs, going all the way back to the months leading up to the Ukrainian Coup in 2014. 9/ All they knew was that there was massive coordination on social media - he specifically cites Facebook - and that they were protesting in the streets. All of this despite the Ukrainians reaching out to the Soros NGO offering coordination and help, never a reason. 8/ Did you hear that last part? The Prosecutor General\u2019s office had NO CLUE what the agenda was from this Soros funded NGO. 7/ I recently did an interview with a former Ukrainian official who was working inside the Prosecutor General\u2019s office. He was actually there when this NGO was organizing street protests to get his boss fired. Watch:\n\nhttps://t.co/6spx5MjG5z 6/ But still\u2026 something seemed incomplete. Why was George Soros funding an NGO in Ukraine ALONGSIDE the Obama Administration. According to TWO former Prosecutor General\u2019s in Ukraine, that NGO - the Anti-Corruption Action Center - was being shielded by the U.S. Government. 5/ So, how do they do it? By using \"Civil &amp; Open Society\" groups to instigate violent regime change\u2026 oh I\u2019m sorry. They don\u2019t use the term regime change. Sounds too scary! They call it quote: \u201cspontaneous, indigenous popular uprisings.\" 4/ Now, when we were first looking into Ukraine, we were primarily focusing on the timeline AFTER February 2014. We knew the coup had brought forward some new possibilities for the Obama Administration, and that was what we were primarily focused on. 3/ These two phrases are used by a global Shadow Government to mold the rest of the world into a Socialist theme park. And it\u2019s all being done in YOUR NAME, but... WITHOUT your consent or vote. 2/ You see them in government documents, aid packages and even by activists rioting in the streets. They are: \u201cCivil Society\u201d and \u201cOpen Society\u201d. 1/ There are two terms that kept popping up in our research of what was happening between the Left and Ukraine, and they\u2019re used interchangeably.

A real scholar. https://t.co/Gu3pQMT8qx @realDonaldTrump All of this is covered in the special we did on the Democrats' and Ukraine's corruption: \nhttps://t.co/QQIJI15MTc @realDonaldTrump 37/ These are the facts. This is what Democrats have been doing over the past FIVE YEARS in Ukraine. What do you think? Is the real story here THIS, or is it that President Trump asked a few questions on a short phone call? @realDonaldTrump 36/ Both the U.S. Ambassador and the Ukraine Ambassador have been recalled to their countries. Both officials have been released presumably for everything I\u2019ve described in this thread. Seems relevant no? https://t.co/vaFhj56ygX @realDonaldTrump 35/ Where is this evidence now? Why haven\u2019t they been granted visas to come to the U.S.? Included in their evidence dump is proof that as much as 7 BILLION was misappropriated and taken out of Ukraine. Some of it to the U.S. Where is the media on this? @realDonaldTrump 34/ Later in 2016, Yovanovitch\u2019s name came up again when she failed to give Ukrainian prosecutors travel visas to the U.S. Why? They had info on Biden and his son and wanted to deliver evidence that Ukrainian officials tried to influence the U.S. election. https://t.co/keaw2v22lU @realDonaldTrump 33/ In 2016, Marie Yovanovitch was appointed U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine. Prosecutor General Lutsenko said that she gave him a \u201cdo not prosecute list\u201d, that included Ukraine MPs and the EXACT SAME Soros funded NGO. https://t.co/p9P0Pe15z9 @realDonaldTrump 32/ Here is the actual recording translated in English, in its entirety, for the first time. It was released by a Ukrainian MP while both Sytnik AND Leshchenko were convicted IN UKRAINIAN COURT of interfering in the U.S. election. https://t.co/tGYlY3nX69 @realDonaldTrump 31/ Lutsenko states that Sytnik is caught on audio admitting to helping Hillary during 2016: \u201cI don\u2019t know how, but the Americans got an audio recording of Mr. Sytnik\u2019s conversation: he is resting with his family and friends and discussing how he would like to help Hillary.\u201d @realDonaldTrump 30/ But what about the other guy that released the Ledger? Director Sytnik of the Anti-Corruption Bureau. In this article from a Ukrainian outlet, Prosecutor General Lutsenko is asked about Sytnik. See here: https://t.co/ajiACsWN4s @realDonaldTrump 29/ This was all about politics, and the Ukrainians were not even hiding that fact. Read here: https://t.co/siVY9yAWTG @realDonaldTrump 28/ To quote Leshchenko: \u201cA Trump presidency would change the pro-Ukrainian agenda in American foreign policy. For me it was important to show not only the corruption aspect, but that he is a pro-Russian candidate who can break the geopolitical balance in the world.\u201d @realDonaldTrump 27/ Surely this wasn\u2019t done to influence the 2016 election right? @realDonaldTrump 26/ The two Ukrainians that released the Ledger that implicated Paul Manafort were a member of the Ukrainian Parliament (Leshchenko) and Director Sytnik of the Anti-Corruption Bureau. This act went right along with the Obama Admin\u2019s orders back in Jan 2016. @realDonaldTrump 25/ Two big things happened in August 2016. Obama appointed a new ambassador in Ukraine, and the Manafort \u201cBlack Ledger\u201d was released by Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Bureau.  Both occurring directly in the heat of the U.S. election. https://t.co/pQ3m4AntB1 @realDonaldTrump 24/ This email was sent in May 2016, exactly one month AFTER the DNC hired Fusion GPS to work on the Dossier. This is the origin of the Russia hoax. A DNC effort collaborated with the Ukrainian Government. See the concerned letter from Senator Grassely: https://t.co/IHUh6DyeW2 @realDonaldTrump 23/ Read this line from the hacked email. \u201cthere is a big Trump component you and Lauren need to be aware of that will hit in next few weeks and something I'm working on you should be aware of.\u201d https://t.co/ReBPOUD8Of @realDonaldTrump 22/ We now know that Chris Steele gave information to Isikoff, and his article was used by the DoJ and FBI to get a FISA warrant for Carter Page. This was the article: https://t.co/rVfW7kAPEq @realDonaldTrump 21/ This is a hacked email between Chalupa and the DNC from May 2016. Chalupa checks in and describes a speaking event at the Library of Congress where she\u2019ll talk about Manafort. She also says that she\u2019s working with Michael Isikoff. Read here: https://t.co/ReBPOUD8Of @realDonaldTrump 20/ A Ukrainian embassy official said quote, \u201cThey were coordinating an investigation with the Hillary team on Paul Manafort with Alexandra Chalupa\u201d. https://t.co/tUAcvDpxXA @realDonaldTrump 19/ In March 2016, Manafort joined the Trump Campaign. Chalupa, on the DNC\u2019s encouragement, began working directly with the Ukrainian Embassy here in the U.S. @realDonaldTrump 18/ The deputy head of Ukraine\u2019s Prosecutor General's Office said there was a, \u201cclear message about helping the Americans\u201d regarding the Manafort case. Keep in mind this is BEFORE the Russia investigation, but DIRECTLY during the 2016 campaign. @realDonaldTrump 17/ The Obama Admin wanted to talk about the case involving Biden and his son, and a case tied to Paul Manafort. You can guess which case Obama wanted investigated and which one he didn\u2019t. This was revealed by a Ukrainian political official at the meeting: https://t.co/TB4mBl4YqL @realDonaldTrump 16/ The EXACT SAME MONTH Chalupa told the DNC that there was a Russia connection between Manafort and @realdonaldtrump, the Obama admin summoned Ukraine prosecutors to the White House. @realDonaldTrump 15/ Chalupa focused on Paul Manafort, who had worked with the former Ukrainian President. Interestingly enough, she decided NOT to focus on Tony Podesta and Tad Devine who were working with Manafort. Hmm\u2026 I wonder why? @realDonaldTrump 14/ In January 2016, Chalupa told the DNC that, \u201cI felt there was a Russia connection\u201d regarding the Trump campaign. This is BEFORE Manafort, BEFORE the Steele Dossier, BEFORE Papadapolous, BEFORE Carter Page. Why was she talking about Russia? @realDonaldTrump 13/ In late 2015, a lawyer working for the DNC began looking for dirt on @realdonaldtrump. Her name was Alexandra Chalupa and she is the daughter of Ukrainian immigrants. The DNC paid her over 71,000 for her work during the election. The financial records: https://t.co/NlgJCdVOvV @realDonaldTrump 12/ Shokin was also investigating an NGO called the Anticorruption Action Center. In 2016, the largest funders were the U.S. Government\u2026 and George Soros\u2019 International Renaissance Foundation. See financial disclosures here: https://t.co/tvWGGmQ6oO @realDonaldTrump 11/ The most damning statements are on page 4, but on page 5 Shokin also states that the Obama admin were, \u201ctelling the heads of the Ukraine law-enforcement system how to investigate and whom to investigate\u201d. @realDonaldTrump 10/ This court doc reveals that Biden never made a specific accusation or provided proof that Shokin was corrupt. He swears, ON RECORD, that he was forced out due to his investigation into Burisma. Read the court doc here: https://t.co/XqIvAJvsft @realDonaldTrump 9/ In March 2016, Biden forced the removal of Ukraine\u2019s General Prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating Burisma. Biden claimed it had nothing to do with his son, but Shokin\u2019s sworn testimony in a European Court completely contradicts this. @realDonaldTrump 8/ A man named Artem Sytnyk was tapped to be the first Director. A position he still holds. https://t.co/8fTKHNpSn8 @realDonaldTrump 7/ In April 2015, the Obama Admin and IMF mandated Ukraine set up the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and they signed an information sharing agreement with the FBI. The Obama admin would know all the dirty laundry that Ukraine might dig up. https://t.co/VbrnhFa3HB @realDonaldTrump 6/ Obama rode in on his white horse to save the day, guaranteeing a 1 billion sovereign loan, 320 million in general assistance, and a fleet of advisors and experts. The Obama admin became the Ukrainian piggy bank. https://t.co/dQYjw6uQYc @realDonaldTrump 5/ Biden\u2019s meeting in Ukraine was regarding a program to assist Ukraine\u2019s natural gas industry, and also discussed the first billion dollars in U.S. assistance. The day after this, Archer was named to the board of Burisma. Three weeks later\u2026 Hunter Biden joined the Board. @realDonaldTrump 4/ In March 2014, Obama made Biden the point man for Ukraine. And in April 2014, Devon Archer visited Biden at the White House. 5 days later Biden arrived in Kiev for his first meeting with the Ukraine Gov. @realDonaldTrump 3/ In February 2014, the Ukrainian Regime fell. Democrats were all over the place in Ukraine, although all the media was concerned about was Paul Manafort. But Democrats sent Obama\u2019s White House counsel, Chief Strategists for Hillary and Bernie, Tony Podesta and Obama\u2019s pollsters @realDonaldTrump 2/ Democrats want you to only focus on the July 25th call. If you\u2019re doing that, then you\u2019re not looking at what Democrats have been doing in Ukraine for the past 5+ years: corruption, greed, strong-arming a foreign government and the manipulation of the U.S. election. (THREAD) 1/ Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, after two years of investigation and millions of dollars, wouldn\u2019t impeach @realdonaldtrump. But a single whistleblower, based off of hearsay, was enough to change their minds? Why? Consider these facts: @HoustonRockets @dmorey you were right the first time.   I STAND WITH HONG KONG.

No, I wasn\u2019t for trump in 16.  But I said at the time I would give him credit if credit was due.

I love the new direction the church is going @Betsyriley3m #JokerMovie was not just a good film, it was a good movie as well.   Well worth your time. 6) #JoaquinPheonix is NO #HeathLedger .  His joker was iconic and the best version of this villain.  But Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s #joker is a totally different take and I believe JP takes this villain to places I have never seen. Heath deserved the Oscar, AND SO DOES JOAQUIN. Brilliant. 5) important film.  If not #JokerFilm will still remain a great movie.  I cannot give it enough stars and an Oscar is too small for #JoaquinPhoenix.   His ability to capture the madness and frankly the profound sadness will go down as one of the best performances ever on film... 4) mental illness.  Profound loneliness.  Anger.

Tarp was $787b and the country was shocked and horrified. Today the fed does it overnight, with next to zero credible reporting to the tune of twice the size and no one even knows. Tarp started the tea party. If a 2008 style event happens again, I fear for the Republic. 1. @Newsweek would rather tell people that I am crazy than report the once in a lifetime fact that the fed just announced that in the next 14 days, They will have pumped $1.4 Trillion of cash into the banking system...basically 2x the size of TARP. Cont. 3.  In 2007, the initial bid from Lehman Brothers for overnight capital lending help from The Fed was $620 Million.  Six Days later a 120 year old company, 11,200 employees, 8.9 Million investors,  worth $14 Billion in market capt...was gone. 1st sign?overnight REPOs from The Fed 22% of JP Morgan's total market cap... in 3 days.

Don\u2019t look here that\u2019s totally normal.  cont JP Morgan has taken on $52 Billion in cash/new capital from the Fed in 3 days.  That is 22% of JP Morgan's total market cap... in 3 days.  The world's largest investment bank, needing $12.5 Billion every day, printed by The Fed, to provide cash on books.... This is not normal or not a big deal.  Anyone who tells you it is doesn\u2019t know their ass from their elbow. Or they are liars.   You need to know the facts. Because they all understand what this. So should you. Get out of hi-interest CC, use LOCAL banks. 3. Through October 10th, assuming $75 Billion per day, plus the $30 Billion 14-day term operations plus what happened this week, the Fed will have pumped $1.4 Trillion of cash into the banking system...basically 2x the size of TARP. 2. In addition to doing overnight Repo Agreements(with a 1 day payback term), they will also start offering a 14-day payback term next week [The Fed has ONLY ever done that twice: 2001 after 9/11 attacks and 2008/Financial crisis before it was replaced with QE], for $30b each day Incase the \u2018journalists\u2019 at @Newsweek ever care to look at facts, here\u2019s a few:\n1.   After Friday's Repo Operation was oversubscribed [again], the Fed announced it would continue Repo Ops through October 10th, for \"at least\" $75 Billion per day. The media, the govt, the banks, giant corps, the fed, edu have all gone insane.  Marianne Williamson makes more sense on nuclear energy than any of you. You will all be fine, but those who can\u2019t afford their house and lose their job won\u2019t be.  This is the biggest con in history. 3 the banks have run the same game they did in 05-08 and now the added problem is the \u2018shortage of money\u2019, due to the fed govt running the same con with unlimited spending. We need someone to buy our debt, the banks buy it, but can\u2019t pay for it, so the Fed prints money. Cont 2.

Again, if you judge them, then you must judge your \u2018progressive\u2019 history.  If you think capitalism is evil, global warming must end today and are not forming an army and killing those who disagree, you are exactly like the founders. My fear is, many don\u2019t value peace 2day. 3. The 3/5th\u2019s clause was to WEAKEN the hold of the slave owners who wanted to count slaves as 1 whole person.  The Founders said \u2018if you don\u2019t count slaves as a human you cannot count them for \u2018representation\u2019. Thus REDUCING influence. The \u2018progressive\u2019 compromise was 3/5th. 2. Answer: because it would require you to kill half the population.  What makes you a \u2018progressive\u2019? You believe in moving the \u2018ball\u2019 down the field bit by bit instead of revolution.  The same in 1789. The constitution banned the sale of humans as step one. Cont. 1.  When you need to lie &amp; distort history to win, it explains why you also need to encourage violence.  This flips the truth of the 3/5th clause on its head.
