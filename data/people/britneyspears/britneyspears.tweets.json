My goodness time flies! http://t.co/IC97MPWcCM Nelson Mandela was a true inspiration to all humanity. He will truly be missed. \"Perfume\" video, next week on @VEVO http://t.co/lE4eymp3Zd It warms my heart that y'all are loving #BritneyJean. Get your copy @amazonmp3 &lt;3 http://t.co/LtJvU2BiVv Lots of love to everyone who has already gotten their copy of #BritneyJean :) MUAH! Xo http://t.co/dps446FIFx That's it!! Thx so much for listening through the album w/ me :) I love reading what u guys think of the songs! #BritneyJeanListeningParty RT @iamwill: @britneyspears both :) @ItsROfficial Your background is hilarious Which version of #Perfume do you guys like the best? I'm not sure I could choose!! I really love both :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty @califever That sounds like fun! #BritneyJeanListeningParty @SamerMajali It does have that feel a little doesn't it? #BritneyJeanListeningParty Next Up: #NowThatIFoundYou! This song just sounds like love doesn't it? :) LOVE the music on this track! #BritneyJeanListeningParty I think it helped set the direction for the album overall. RT @loosho @britneyspears what makes it different? #BritneyJeanListeningParty @InsaneMia All of the Britney Army are my Brightest Morning Stars #BritneyJeanListeningParty @KurtiusMaximus OMG too funny #BritneyJeanListeningParty @CoolBeans_XD Love that :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty It\u2019s the 1st song I recorded for #BritneyJean. My dear friend @KooolKojak came over to my house w/ his guitar &amp; we wrote this song together. @TiffanyZeyer Cute! #BritneyJeanListeningParty #HoldOnTight is a little different from the rest of the record, but I loved writing and recording this one!! #BritneyJeanListeningParty RT @teambritneyuk_: @britneyspears my nephew who's 4 years old and has Autism.. My 'Brightest Morning Star' :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty Brightest Morning Star is a song @Sia helped me write about God :) Who is ur Brightest Morning Star? #BritneyJeanListeningParty @dangerbritney That's what I hoped for! #BritneyJeanListeningParty @BuzzFeed Chillin' with you ;) @WesleyWalrus Well thank you. Don't cry though! #BritneyJeanListeningParty He suggested getting Foster The People 2 help on production. I really think they nailed it. They added a few bells &amp; the whistle on the song When @iamwill &amp; I were finishing the song we felt it was missing something. It felt like it needed something to make the song more unique... Funny story about that! RT @EmreAkn I love the whistle in the beginning. It gives me chills. And the lyrics are soo emotional :( @neevebayb Means the world sweetie, thank you! #BritneyJeanListeningParty This one was very therapeutic for me. Sometimes a girl needs to remind herself not to cry and that life will go on. Really proud of the final version of #DontCry :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty @GrantPYoung @jamielynnspears I have too! It finally felt right for this album. #BritneyJeanListeningParty @jamielynnspears Your voice really shines on #ChillinWithYou sis!! Proud of u &lt;3 @Robin_H00d Good luck!! Thanks for tweeting along :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty She's more of a country artist and I'm obviously pop so we figured we would meet in the middle :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty @hausofbliss Wait until you hear more of her music! @brunolovesbrit @jamielynnspears That would be fun wouldn't it?? #BritneyJeanListeningParty She's been working on her first album in Nashville for a while and I thought it would be really cool to have her on my album. @AllexxSpears Enjoy the ride :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty .@jamielynnspears and I had SO much fun recording #ChillinWithYou!! #BritneyJeanListeningParty I just loved this song and it spoke to me right away. RT @hausofbader The beat and lyrics are everything! #BritneyJeanListeningParty @zacharyfunk Aw thankya Zachary. Loved loved loved recording this one. #BritneyJeanListeningParty @leogmz @katyperry Yes she is! #BritneyJeanListeningParty My girl @KatyPerry wrote this one with @Sia and the @Diplo track is incredible :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty I fell in love with #Passenger as soon as I heard it! #BritneyJeanListeningParty @breatheheavycom Hehe! Life is funny like that. Think I've kicked myself a few times after breaking up w someone. Dont kno why it\u2019s always so clear AFTER u breakup This makes me smile! RT @alekjandro it's makes me stronger, It's helping me@cope with a broken heart &lt;/3 #BritneyJeanListeningParty @Manon_ASP Yes ma'am #BritneyJeanListeningParty @ElenitaSPEARS Too sweet, thank you sweetie xo #BritneyJeanListeningParty #TilItsGone is a post-break up song, and it's true... You never really know what you have until it's gone. #BritneyJeanListeningParty @picsoftumblr I see you now! O_O #BritneyJeanListeningParty @leoinsiders2 A God job, wow! Ha #BritneyJeanListeningParty @MRKiNGALEXXX You'll have to wait &amp; see ;) #BritneyJeanListeningParty The show I'm putting together has more dance than any show I've ever done. I guess I was dancing until my body ached every single day. LOL!! When I cut this song I was right in the middle of dance rehearsals for my Vegas show... @freeasmydick So cool! #BritneyJeanListeningParty I think at my core, I am a dancer through and through. ;) #BritneyJeanListeningParty And the next song is #BodyAche! I think this song speaks to my biggest passion which has always been dancing. @teambritneyuk_ Omgoodness, me too.

Xo #BritneyJeanListeningParty Sooner than you think! RT @britneyspeans My favorite! when are we getting the video? #BritneyJeanListeningParty @TiffanyCarterxo Lips are sealed :) #BritneyJeanListeningParty Can you guess who this song is about? #Perfume is really just about relationship insecurities &amp; feeling insecure about the person you care for the most #BritneyJeanListeningParty You better believe it! RT @dangerbritney Are u going to perform Work Bitch in Vegas? #BritneyJeanListeningParty @TWY69 Hehe, nope don't have 1 of those either #BritneyJeanListeningParty @CassPiamyheroes Get it girl! #BritneyJeanListeningParty Here comes the smasher!!
