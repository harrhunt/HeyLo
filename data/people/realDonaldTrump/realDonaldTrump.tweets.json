This testing, and what we have so quickly done, is used as a Fake News weapon. Sad! Somebody please tell Congressman Clyburn, who doesn\u2019t have a clue, that the chart he put up indicating more CASES for the U.S. than Europe, is because we do MUCH MORE testing than any other country in the World.

Also, highly inaccurate numbers being reported by many other countries!!! @WSJ Mail-In Voting is already proving to be a catastrophic disaster. Even testing areas are way off. The Dems talk of foreign influence in voting, but they know that Mail-In Voting is an easy way for foreign countries to enter the race. Even beyond that, there\u2019s no accurate count! Germany pays Russia billions of dollars a year for Energy, and we are supposed to protect Germany from Russia. What\u2019s that all about? Also, Germany is very delinquent in their 2% fee to NATO.

As President of the United States, I am asking for a legal solution on DACA, not a political one, consistent with the rule of law. The Supreme Court is not willing to give us one, so now we have to start this process all over again.

Nevertheless, I will only act in the best interests of the United States of America! ...Religious Liberty, among many other things, are OVER and GONE!
