This was not meant to attack anyone, just bring awareness so youtube can continue to be an amazing place Someone very close to me was kidnapped and went missing for 4 days. This title/thumbnail trending #1 was a huge slap in the face to this person. I can only imagine how damaging this would be for those who never got to see their loved ones again after they went missing. https://t.co/EuZ786dZrt Not only did this creator not take this video down but @YouTube trended it 3 consecutive days, the first 2 days trending it NUMBER 1. It is still trending. Creators content gets blocked because of a couple harmless curse words but they promote content mocking TRAUMA for views. I do recognize people make mistakes but accountability and ownership needs to be taken. With such large platforms creators need to realize how their content can affect people. Using \u201cgoing missing\u201d with a missing poster and friends crying in a thumbnail as clickbait is disgusting Damn ok I saw something the other day that really did not sit right with me. I\u2019ve been hesitant to speak up because I don\u2019t like to be \u201cproblematic\u201d but at this point it could be damaging to a lot of people and trigger PTSD and trauma. @velvetbesson @hookedethan @GraysonDolan Sup dyl @GraysonDolan @niqhtchqnges @GraysonDolan Hahahahahah New video \ud83d\udc41\ud83e\uddfc\ud83e\uddfc\ud83d\udc41\n\nhttps://t.co/ef5Ccg4FSE I need to sanitize my eyes after filming tomorrow\u2019s video Using this last week of 2020 to pause, breathe and rejuvenate.

I love the sun I love sweating when I\u2019m allowed to be sweaty. Sweating when I\u2019m doing stuff that shouldn\u2019t make me sweat but does, sucks. Like walking around the street going shopping and sweating like a big ole fuckin pig is the worst. But when I got my shorts on runnin around, hellll yeaaa\ud83d\ude0d Just found out we\u2019ve been in quarantine for 50 days... what?!?\n\nI feel like it\u2019s been 20 days MAX.

When I dropped it off I actually said \u201cI\u2019ll miss you\u201d by accident?!? the guy there looked at me weird. He prob thinks I have a car fetish or some shit now:/ @Wakeheart \ud83d\ude1d @HOMEBAKEDGRAY It\u2019s perfect I feel like I don\u2019t say this enough but I appreciate you so much. You reading this tweet, taking the time out of your day to care about me. It means the world. When I think about how supportive you all are it makes me emotional, so thank you Gray and I just got into a heated argument and it ended with me crying laughing. Seriously have not laughed that hard in YEARS. I couldn\u2019t breathe. He started trying to be funny and I was mad at him so I tried to hold my laugh in with all my strength but I couldn\u2019t \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 This is devastating.. I\u2019m in shock. Wow. He inspired so many people.. my heart is broken for his family. His daughters.. this is so sad. \nRest In Peace Kobe \ud83d\udc9c Grayson just asked me to burp him because he\u2019s been wondering if \u201cbeing burped as an adult still works the same as being burped when you\u2019re a baby\u201d \n\nIdk what\u2019s wrong with him buuuut yea i\u2019m curious now too so gonna try it out Driving in NYC and Grayson has made 6 wrong turns so far.. I tell him to go right, he goes left, then BLAMES ME. Please get me out of this car \ud83d\ude2d Sharing some exciting news with you guys tomorrow \nsomething we\u2019ve put a lot of ourselves into \ud83e\udd0d RT @GraysonDolan: Changing gears from the doc for a sec.. E and I are announcing something that is really special to us tomorrow. \ud83d\ude33 lil bit\u2026 @mahonedolann @GraysonDolan Love you guys \u2764\ufe0f Creating this documentary has allowed me to grow in ways in which I previously thought were impossible. I love and miss my dad more than words can describe, but I\u2019ll come closer than ever to expressing those feelings through this documentary. This was something we had a hard time with this past year. At times I felt so wrong for feeling or lacking certain emotions. We want to help anyone in our positions. I felt very alone at times and I don\u2019t want anyone to feel that way Filming a docu about losing our best friend, our dad. Not going to lie, it\u2019s been very difficult. We\u2019re not going to fabricate or polish anything. We want to show those who have ever experienced loss at any capacity, that they have every right to feel any feeling they may feel. Gray and I are on opposite sides of the country rn and have just been texting each other dumb ass jokes all day \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Bro this was the weirdest shit ever. I was honestly just so confused the whole time. It really didn\u2019t make any sense at all. I have no clue what could\u2019ve been going thru that guys mind. It was really hard for me to understand why he said that because my Tesla radiates BDE https://t.co/AmrvtpaD4f Going into this new year gray and I decided that we want to be closer to you guys. We\u2019re working on a BUNCH of projects that will bring us all together.

Only one in the fam to graduate college. We would talk about how tough it was at times for her and I\u2019m so proud of her for pushing thru. Fuck ya Cam! @RickyPDillon @GraysonDolan Love you Rick\u2764\ufe0f We\u2019re thinking about uploading the first episode of a new series to our channel on dec. 19\ud83d\ude2c @RyanAbe @GraysonDolan Thank you my man \u2764\ufe0f @grethanboobs @GraysonDolan This is insane! Thank you \ud83d\ude0a \u2764\ufe0f Just turned 20... this is weird. Grayson just said in this decade he will make a small spawn of himself.. I think that\u2019s what it\u2019s called when fish lay eggs. He\u2019s trying to say he wants to have a kid in his 20s.. mans needs to relax Last day as a teen... what lmao idk how to feel about this \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude1b\ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude30\ud83e\udd73 @BRlGHTNlGHTSKY I thought of something \ud83e\udd13 I have really good Christmas gift ideas this year fuck yea I love giving gifts What do I get gray for his bday help @dolanmydude @GraysonDolan Sending lots of love @KyleHouck_ Fucking disgusting rock @larrayxo Love you @RyanAbe Love you man Happy 51st to the fuckin coolest.. my true best friend. One of the only people I trust with everything in me It\u2019s my dad\u2019s birthday today. Miss him more than anything. Hurts to not be able to get him an epic gift and go all out and plan really cool stuff to do with him. I\u2019m going to dedicate this day to him and do stuff he always loved doing @RickyPDillon U kno the fuckin vibez Van series FINALE is up! \n\nNot everything went as planned but we filmed it all so....\n\nhttps://t.co/pcgYaa2XjW I remember seeing a video of juice wrld freestyle for over an hour, it really blew my mind. SO much talent. He had so much left to do/accomplish. 21 years old... this is so tragic. My thoughts are with him and those close to him. This is so upsetting... so young \ud83d\ude14 Gray and I really wanted to get the video up today because we can\u2019t wait to show you guys but we want to make sure it\u2019s the best it can be. We love the video and want to take today with it just to make sure it\u2019s the best we can make it. It\u2019ll be up tomorrow 100%. Can\u2019t wait \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude27 VAN SERIES PT.3 COMING TOMORROW I\u2019m gonna be 20? In 10 days? \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude1f Can\u2019t fault them for this completely because I\u2019ve kinda been there before. Just think they should\u2019ve thought this one thru more. Def a missed opportunity Lastly, YT stated that this video was strictly created for the viewers basically to avoid the hate they recieved last year. Not a good message to promote. You should always create for YOURSELF, not for the approval of others The part where YT jumped on the band wagon &amp; hated on themselves for last years rewind after actually putting a lot of effort into that project rubbed me the wrong way. Had a great opportunity to show effects of something you\u2019re proud of being shit on &amp; being able to bounce back Pretty disappointed in YouTube rewind tbh.. very out of touch. There\u2019s more to creating than numbers! We need to give people credit for their effort/talent, not how much attention they get. very cool people were given recognition in the vid but for the wrong reasons I feel... :/ Grayson just told me \u201che could definitely wear a Speedo now that he has a mustache.\u201d I think I might agree a little actually just threw up... def because of what I put my body thru the past 2 days... need to recover. Sorry if ur picturing me throwing up now and u think that stuffs gross That was the most fucked thing I\u2019ve ever done @tangledoIan I totally did LMAO I was gonna tell u I was gonna then I forgot but yea I thought this was hilarious You better build me a castle hut like you promised https://t.co/KIsAYl2dRK Holy fuck I\u2019m gonna cry https://t.co/JL9r6G19A6 I look 7 years younger without my beard this is fucked @RickyPDillon A big time slay Saying goodbye to my beard.

We\u2019re going to feel a bunch of feelings we might not want to feel. Face the feelings head on and most importantly, tell yourself nothing but the TRUTH. Progression starts with the truth Finally getting out of a mental rut... sometimes it takes a while to recognize what your problem is and admit that you\u2019re lying to yourself about something. I\u2019m totally fine, just happy that I\u2019m learning everyday, even if it\u2019s from my mistakes \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\u2764\ufe0f @innocentgrayson Love ya @twaimz @GraysonDolan Yay:) glad u like I laugh at the most stupid shit Needa do somethin spontaneous today I\u2019m tired of being bored I went to a store today right after Grayson did and the guy at the register said \u201cyou look like a guy who was just here, just not as buff\u201d \n\n................ \ud83d\ude16 @RickyPDillon @GraysonDolan HAHAHAHAHAHA Yea fuck ever being separated ever again https://t.co/VehjDfE8N1 Got him \ud83d\ude0a\n\nhttps://t.co/BH317WfmEz Happy birthday sis \u2764\ufe0f Some fuck shit happened to me today....

Just sad about those little kids having to grow up in that negative enviroment with such irrational and immature role models. A car just pulled up beside me and yelled discriminatory slurs at me for actually no reason. They had children in the backseat, and I was really disappointed to see the bad example they were setting for them. Always make sure to set a good example. Kids are the future Really feeling like myself lately:) Grayson just tried to start a fire with a taser and burnt some of his hair off... Sometimes I wanna be an astronaut. Is it possible to do that part time? I still wanna make videos but also be an astronaut Gray and I just officially started a project we\u2019re extremely excited about and never thought we\u2019d actually be able to do.

I get out there and HE DIDNT HAVE THE KEY IN WTF. Idk if I get mad about this or feel bad for him idk Just ate way too much ice cream I was driving behind a car and because of how slow the car was moving I immediately thought it was a grandma. So I pulled up next to the car at the red light ready to finesse an old lady\u2019s number, but it was just Grayson... :/ Grayson drives soo SLOW Ready for it to be warm out... or maybe I\u2019ll just go somewhere where it is \ud83e\udd28 Somewhere FAR very soon\ud83e\udd14 I just took a nap and Grayson rearranged our whole room?!

I respect you all so much- wish I could hang with u all at some point in my life u guys are cool Just did the craziest shit I\u2019ve ever done in my life Guys it\u2019s up!!\n\nhttps://t.co/mnMZQCRkJg\n\nWe\u2019ve been waiting to make a vid like this for the longest time. We had a lot of fun with it hope you like it!:) today\u2019s vid is a special one If you believe people are less than you do to their skin color, ethnic background, OR HOW THEY WERE BORN, please unfollow me, you are not welcomed here. For the rest of you, love you and continue to lift each other up. We\u2019re are all human \ud83d\udc99 I\u2019ve seen posts stating I have been avoiding commenting on this issue.. which is false. If I see something like this I will address it immediately. Just because I\u2019m not on my phone all day, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m running away from an issue that needs to be resolved Hey guys. I\u2019m seeing a lot of discussion about racism in my notifications. Also seeing some false accusations about myself for some reason.. please know that racism is something that I will never tolerate. It\u2019s disgusting and I can\u2019t believe it still exists. My dad came out to cali today glad he was able to make it out here:) Gray and I are planning on going somewhere very far soon \u2708\ufe0f\ud83e\udd14 We\u2019re all the same I have to pee so bad and Grayson\u2019s driving so slow AHHHH get me tfo Grayson is such a little bitch with scary movies no way we\u2019re identical I need some new pants Excited for tomorrow\ud83d\ude0a It\u2019s up! Bloopers 2017. \n\nhttps://t.co/yOdmzcPxui Uploading now! The video should be up very soon I\u2019m going to speak up and use my voice from now on. I\u2019m tired of people steering this generation in the wrong direction. Not at all saying that I control an entire genertation, but with the gift of this platform I\u2019ve been given, it\u2019s the least I can do. The horrible measures people will go to in order to have content to stay relevant is absolutely disgusting. Being blinded by your ego so much so that thinking it is okay to make insensitive remarks about suicide, and broadcasting it for millions of CHILDREN to see is sickening. I\u2019m in disbelief right now 2017 actually kinda sucked in the beginning but your constant support def helped turn it around for me so thank u for that :) let\u2019s all have a great 2018 Happy NEW yeaR my resolution is to idk Can\u2019t go into 2018 without a 2017 DT blooper reel?
