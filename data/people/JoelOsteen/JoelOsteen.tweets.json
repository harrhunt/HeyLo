Be inspired by this message from Joel, \"Settled Accounts\". \n\nCheck it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/c7WZCiuSpn People notice when you go the extra mile. That doesn\u2019t mean you have the most talent; it means you know how to serve well. You're not at the mercy of how other people have treated you. They don\u2019t control your destiny. Stay encouraged; your time is coming. God is not going to leave your account in a deficit. You don\u2019t have to vindicate yourself. God will not only vindicate you, but He\u2019ll make it up to you. So, stay on the high road; keep being your best. \n\nClick here to watch, \"Settled Accounts\": https://t.co/kMfAhXoPj9 https://t.co/u7FzLhsCoy No person can stop your destiny unless you allow them to. God is watching over you. He\u2019s seen the lonely nights, and He has beauty for the ashes, He has blessings for the burdens, He has joy for the mourning. If the injustice, the person that walked away, the boss that did you wrong were going to stop God\u2019s plan, they would be more powerful than God. No bad break, no disappointment, no betrayal has stopped what God has in store for you. Payback is coming, vindication is coming, restoration is coming. \n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Settled Accounts\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/wLrWZBNF01 You may be at a deficit now. Life hasn\u2019t been fair, people have left you out, a family member has turned on you, the storm set you back. But stay in peace; your time is coming. God is going to make it up to you. They may have walked away, said things that damaged your reputation, but God is not going to let you stay down, mistreated, shortchanged. No, get ready. Payback is coming. He is a just God. What belongs to you is on the way. Broken promises, betrayals, rejection are a part of life. God is saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m going to pay you back. I\u2019m going to make it up to you.\u201d You don\u2019t have to get even; you don\u2019t have to vindicate yourself. The Most High God is going to settle your account. God controls the universe. He knows what you\u2019re owed. He knows how to make it up to you. He will bless you despite people trying to keep you down. They can\u2019t stand against our God. \n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today! \"Settled Accounts\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/0iQtTqq6EI When you come to the end of your ability, when you run out of options and it looks like a setback, it\u2019s really a setup. God\u2019s about to do something unusual, something you couldn\u2019t make happen. As long as you\u2019re worried, trying to make things happen in your own strength, that will limit what God will do. The Psalmist said, \u201cBe still and know that He is God.\u201d Clear out the worry, clear out the offense, clear out the negativity. The reason you can\u2019t see a way is because it\u2019s not going to happen naturally. God is going to do it supernaturally, in ways that you couldn\u2019t make happen. Don\u2019t try to figure it out; just keep believing, keep expecting, keep doing the right thing. In Peaceful on Purpose, you will discover that you weren't designed to carry the heavy load yourself: step back to let God step in.\n\nPre-order your copy today - https://t.co/GH7rN7CkwA\n\n#PeacefulOnPurposeBook https://t.co/vw2imJHnsE When you\u2019re in peace, you\u2019re showing God that you trust Him. \n\nCheck out \"Unclutter Your Mind\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/7iCdzlZfKC When you realize you are enough by yourself, then you won\u2019t rely on people to approve you. You\u2019ll get your approval from your Heavenly Father. You\u2019ll know you\u2019re made in His image. You\u2019ll know He\u2019s crowned you with favor. Quit comparing your gifts, your looks, your success to someone else. Be you. You are powerful, you are anointed, you are gifted, you are beautiful. Nobody can do you like you can do you. God is not going to vindicate you in private; He\u2019s going to do it in public. Your enemies will see you blessed, favored, successful. \n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Unclutter Your Mind\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/56XjnI7cNa God wouldn\u2019t have given you the opportunity, He wouldn\u2019t have told you to rise and walk if you couldn\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t let comfort hold you back. Being comfortable will keep you from your potential. You were created to stretch. You were created to go further. Every time you declare victory, the miracle is getting closer. Every time you say, \u201cI am healed,\u201d you\u2019re moving toward healing. Every time you say, \u201cI am blessed,\u201d you\u2019re moving toward increase and promotion. God will vindicate you better than you can vindicate yourself. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \"Unclutter Your Mind\". \n\nCheck it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/7Ty3TVYgFL You came into a cutback season, but that\u2019s not a surprise to God. Now, whether you stay there or not depends on what you do. If you get bitter, go around defeated, then you\u2019ll get stuck. Realize that cutback is a sign that new growth is coming. There\u2019s a lot of noise these days, a lot of drama, things we can get pulled into: worry, offense, doubt, jealousy. That may be around us, but it doesn\u2019t have to get in us. Pay attention to what you\u2019re allowing in your spirit. God said He would give you beauty for the ashes. But here\u2019s the key, you have to let go of the ashes before you can receive the beauty. \n\nClick here to watch, \"Unclutter Your Mind\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/5qzuhznFYB Clear out the worry, clear out the offense, clear out the negativity. Live from a place of peace, a place of rest, a place of faith. God has you in the palm of His hand. Nothing you\u2019re facing is a surprise to Him. You only have so much emotional energy each day. Do you know how much energy it takes to hold a grudge, to be bitter, to think about how you can pay somebody back? That\u2019s wasting valuable energy you need for dreams, for your family, for your destiny. Your time is too valuable to live it offended, upset. Life is flying by. We can never get this day back. Live it in peace; live it in faith. \n\nListen now to this message from Joel, \"Unclutter Your Mind\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/4GqZIYzYyI When you go through a disappointment or something doesn\u2019t work out, you can hold on to it and live discouraged, or you can let it go and say, \u201cGod, I know You have something better. I know Your plans for me are for good. I know You\u2019re directing my steps.\u201d Fear can\u2019t stay where faith is. Discouragement can\u2019t stay where hope is. Stress can\u2019t stay where peace is. Guilt can\u2019t stay where forgiveness is. Mediocrity can\u2019t stay where greatness is. Program your mind with what God says about you. You weren\u2019t created to live worried, guilty, upset, bitter. If you\u2019re going to reach your destiny, you have to clear out the clutter. You can\u2019t stop negative things from coming, but you can keep them from staying. You don\u2019t have to hold on to it. Don\u2019t criticize what God has created. Don\u2019t say another negative word about yourself. You\u2019ve been wonderfully made. \n\nTune into Joel\u2019s message today! \"Unclutter Your Mind\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/SJ2hASUpPo Anyone can trust God when things are going their way, life is good, you\u2019re seeing favor. The real test is, will you trust Him when things are shaking? Will you stay in faith when there\u2019s uncertainty, things you don\u2019t understand? The guilt is not from God; that\u2019s the accuser. The language of faith says, \u201cI may feel guilty, but I know I am forgiven.\u201d You can\u2019t go by what you feel; you have to go by what you know. Feelings don\u2019t always tell us the truth. The One that matters has His eyes on you. The One that controls the universe, the One that turns people\u2019s hearts, He\u2019s watching over you, He\u2019s working out His plan for your life. God is going to put promises in your heart that are out of the ordinary, things that seem unlikely, too big, too costly, too much opposition, too late. Now it\u2019s up to you what you do with that promise.\n\nCheck out \"When God Seems too Late\" on Podcast: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/Z4QJWBt4kN You have to be willing to do something small before God will trust you with something big. What you need may be big, but we serve a big God. He wouldn\u2019t have put the dream in your heart if He couldn\u2019t bring it to pass. Maybe He\u2019s just waiting for you to call it in, to use your words to release your faith. The scripture says, \u201cGod sees every sparrow, every bird that falls to the ground.\u201d How much more does He see you? You\u2019re His child. \n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"When God Seems too Late\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/Szfp0FoX7r Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not getting credit. Don\u2019t get discouraged if people don\u2019t thank you. God sees your sacrifice. When you give, He gives you more back. When you show someone favor, He shows you more favor. When you focus on not just accomplishing your dreams but on being a blessing, serving others, then you\u2019re going to have more joy and you\u2019re going to be more fulfilled. Is there anything too hard for the Lord? Just because it seems like God is too late that doesn\u2019t mean He\u2019s not going to come through. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \"When God Seems too Late\". \n\nCheck it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/ZZg6JVuorq The scripture says, \u201cCome boldly to the throne of grace to obtain mercy.\u201d When you need mercy, don\u2019t go to God weakly, intimidated, telling Him how you don\u2019t measure up. Go boldly. Go with confidence, knowing that you\u2019re forgiven, knowing that He\u2019s for you. If you don\u2019t feel good about something, if you have to talk yourself into it, make excuses about why it\u2019s okay, then it\u2019s not worth it. You\u2019ll never go wrong taking the high road. Show God He can trust you, that you\u2019ll go the extra mile to do the right thing. Despite your lack of faith, God can show out in your life. That\u2019s how good God is. If He only blessed us when we believed, we wouldn\u2019t reach our destiny. \n\nClick here to watch, \"When God Seems too Late\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/mM09EYTDgz You may not see any sign of it, every circumstance says there\u2019s no way. But here\u2019s the key, if you could see how it was going to happen, that wouldn\u2019t take any faith. God didn\u2019t miscalculate. He didn\u2019t accidentally choose the wrong person. He let the odds be against you on purpose. He has some unscheduled blessings for you, things that are out of season, things that shouldn\u2019t happen now. When thoughts tell you, \u201cIt\u2019s too late; it\u2019s never going to happen now.\u201d Let that go in one ear and out the other. God is faithful. What He promised you is still en route. \n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"When God Seems too Late\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/nfSTEIfRdD Trust Him when you don\u2019t see anything happening. Believe when heaven is silent. He\u2019s working behind the scenes. The delay is a sign that God is up to something big. It\u2019s a sign that He\u2019s about to show out in your life. God is saying, \u201cLet me show you who I am. I\u2019m not limited by time; I\u2019m not affected by the economy. I\u2019m not restricted by your age, your background, the opposition, by how long it\u2019s been. I control the universe.\" Many times God waits on purpose, till the odds are against us, He waits till the obstacle is too big, so when He turns it around, there won\u2019t be any doubt that it was His favor, His healing, His power making a way where there was no way. People judge by the outside. They\u2019ll try to write you off, but they don\u2019t know what God put in you. They can\u2019t see your seeds of greatness.  God loves to take people that others discount, others discredit, and show out in their life. Get your hopes up. Start expecting abundant rain. Get ready for overflow. God is about to exceed your expectations. You\u2019re coming out of the dry place into more than enough. The circumstances may not change, but you can change. Have a new perspective. God\u2019s plans for you are for good. He\u2019s already lined up what you need to fulfill your destiny. There are opportunities in your future bigger than you can imagine. The scripture says, \u201cGod is a very present help in trouble.\u201d When you\u2019re in trouble, God is right there with you. He comes into the prison, into the hospital, into the difficulty.  \n\nCheck out \"Closed Doors Can't Stop You\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/icUjcT4x3o It may not make sense to you; it may be uncomfortable. You may feel like you\u2019re going the wrong direction, but you don\u2019t know what God is up to. You may have been cutback, but God is saying, \u201cWatch where you\u2019ll be next year.\u201d You may gain with people, gain some material things, but what if you lose with God? He controls the universe. He\u2019s the one that can open the windows of heaven and pour out blessings you can\u2019t contain. I\u2019d rather have favor with Him than with people. No person can stop your destiny, no bad break, no sickness, no opposition. You\u2019re going to look back and say, \u201cWhat I thought was setting me back was setting me up to go further than I ever dreamed.\u201d \n\nClick here to watch \"Closed Doors Can't Stop You\":\nhttps://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/mofSH0oQvo When you come into your set time, God will make things happen that you couldn\u2019t make happen. He can do what medicine cannot do. He\u2019s not limited by what limits us. We\u2019re natural; He\u2019s supernatural. It may look impossible, you may not be able to do it on your own, but you\u2019re not on your own. Don\u2019t make the mistake of talking about how it\u2019s not going to happen. You have to call in what God promised. You may think you\u2019re too old to accomplish your dream, but it\u2019s on the way. You may think it\u2019s too late to start your business, but it\u2019s on the way. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \"Closed Doors Can't Stop You\". \n\nCheck it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/CufJUkrtCN You have to take control of your thought life. That\u2019s where the battle is taking place. If you let negative thoughts continue to play, they\u2019ll keep you from your destiny. When you don\u2019t see a way, instead of getting discouraged, you have to remind yourself, \u201cThe God we serve is not looking for a door; He\u2019s not hoping to find the door. He is the door.\u201d Even if we let fear, insecurity, intimidation cause us to shrink back, God says, \"That\u2019s no problem for Me. Fear can\u2019t keep Me out; depression can\u2019t stop what I have for you; limited thinking can\u2019t hold Me back.\"  \n\nWatch, \"Closed Doors Can't Stop You\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/OEnNwf1tXG Here\u2019s the key, you and God are a majority. What He has destined for your life will override anyone or anything trying to stop you. Even if someone is against you, they can\u2019t keep you from getting to where you\u2019re supposed to be. The scripture says, \u201cGod opens doors that no man can shut, and He shuts doors that no man can open.\u201d God is your doorkeeper. Other people can\u2019t keep you out of your purpose; obstacles can\u2019t keep you from what God has ordained for you. It may seem like the door of opportunity has closed on your dreams. Every circumstance says it\u2019s too late. Thank God that He\u2019s making a way when you don\u2019t see a way. \n\nListen now to this message from Joel, \"Closed Doors Can't Stop You\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/ChnN9IpOAh God knows what\u2019s in you; He knows what you\u2019re capable of. He\u2019s not going to let fear hold you back. He\u2019s not going to let the negative things people have spoken over you keep you from moving forward. God can go around what\u2019s blocking you. He can go over who\u2019s trying to stop you. He can go through the opposition. He can move someone that\u2019s holding you back out of the way. People can\u2019t keep you out of your purpose; obstacles can\u2019t keep you from what God has ordained for you. \n\nTune into Joel\u2019s message today! \"Closed Doors Can't Stop You\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/n9RzsYpgeQ God is not just a way maker. He is the way. He can create what you need. That\u2019s why He\u2019s called the great \"I AM.\" \n\u2014I AM whatever you need.\n\u2014I AM favor.\n\u2014I AM breakthroughs.\n\u2014I AM healing.\n\u2014I AM victory. Don\u2019t put off opportunities to be a blessing to people, to serve those around you. You don\u2019t know where that small step is taking you. Your purpose could be waiting for you at that next act of obedience. The way to honor God is not by being down on yourself, living guilty, unworthy; it\u2019s by receiving His mercy. The price has already been paid. All your sins past, present, and future have been taken care of. When you make a mistake, go to God and ask for forgiveness, then move on. The first time you asked, God not only forgave you, but He doesn\u2019t remember it anymore. Don\u2019t be discouraged by the trouble. It\u2019s not stopping anything God has for you. God is storing up all the joy, all the good breaks, all the favor. \n\nCheck out \"Trouble is Temporary\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/vznjFVJTg7 Quit worrying about who\u2019s ahead of you and how it\u2019s not going to work out. God can quickly change things, quickly promote you, quickly heal you, quickly free you. God sees everything. He\u2019s keeping the records. The scripture says, \u201cWhat you do in secret, God will reward in the open.\u201d Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not getting credit. Don\u2019t get discouraged if people don\u2019t thank you. God sees your sacrifice. The trouble is temporary; the trouble is not going to last forever. You may be in difficult time, but that\u2019s not how your story ends. \n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Trouble is Temporary\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/qqvhGTkx4f God said He would give you beauty for the ashes. But here\u2019s the key, you have to let go of the ashes before you can receive the beauty. You have to release the miracle. When you say, \u201cI am free.\u201d In the unseen realm, chains are broken, strongholds are loosed. You are prophesying your future. Listen to the words coming out of your mouth. That trouble looks permanent, but God is saying it\u2019s not going to last very long. It\u2019s not by your might, not by your power, but by the Spirit of the living God. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \"Trouble is Temporary\". \n\nCheck it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/b5NRlsEpHJ We all want to rise higher, accomplish dreams, overcome obstacles, but as long as we\u2019re only focused on ourselves, we\u2019ll get stuck. God brings people and opportunities across our path so we can be a blessing. It\u2019s okay to have times where you feel discouraged and you don\u2019t see how it can work out. It\u2019s okay to start there, but don\u2019t finish there. Don\u2019t stay in the ashes; don\u2019t stay defeated. God didn\u2019t bring you this far to leave you. God won\u2019t let you get in a situation that He can\u2019t bring you out of. If the trouble was too much, the sickness too great, the opposition too strong, He wouldn\u2019t have allowed it. \n\nClick here to watch, \"Trouble is Temporary\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/I9d5g65kbd Your latter days will be better than your former days. Your story doesn\u2019t end in defeat. It doesn\u2019t end in failure, injustice, sorrow. Those are temporary seasons. Your story ends in victory. If you\u2019ll stay in faith, keep being your best, you\u2019re going to come into your \u201cafter this.\u201d You\u2019ll say, \u201cAfter the layoff, I got a better position. After they walked away, I met someone better. After the storm, I came out stronger.\u201d Don\u2019t get discouraged by difficulties. The promise we have is not that trouble won\u2019t come, but that the trouble is not going to last.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Trouble is Temporary\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/zecyZF31pN That cancer is not bigger than our God, that breakup didn\u2019t stop your purpose, that trouble at work is not going to last. God is behind the scenes right now, working in your life. Your time is coming. It\u2019s going to happen sooner than you think. No person can stand against our God: no bad break, no sickness, no trouble. God controls the universe. He said, \u201cWeeping may endure for a night, but joy is coming in the morning.\u201d Just because we\u2019re people of faith doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t have difficulties. You can be doing the right thing and come into trouble. The scripture says rain falls on the just and the unjust. The promise we have is not that trouble won\u2019t come, but that the trouble won't last. There is a blessing on your life that protects you and guards you because you honor God. When you walk in integrity, you won\u2019t just see God\u2019s favor, you\u2019ll see His protection. God doesn\u2019t expect you to be strong all the time. He understands there will be times that we get weary. The good news is He doesn\u2019t fault us for feeling weak. The scripture says, \u201cWhen you are weak, He is strong.\u201d That pressure that feels unbearable, it\u2019s not there to defeat you, but to help you discover strength that you didn\u2019t know you had. You weren\u2019t created to survive, but to thrive. You are stronger than you think.\n\nGet the full message here:  https://t.co/He3jTR1APc https://t.co/yq6FXHZjzk We are blessed to be a blessing!\u00a0Thank you to our amazing volunteers and staff who have served over 600 people since Sunday.

Stay safe, continue to pray for Texas. https://t.co/hM9rk6CULQ The only thing that\u2019s holding some people back is who they\u2019re spending time with. You need some eagles in your life: people that soar, people that are doing great things, people that have a great attitude. You have to be careful what you allow in. You can\u2019t stop everything from coming, but you can stop it from getting down in your spirit. You need to keep your atmosphere full of faith, full of praise, full of hope, full of victory. You have a space that belongs only to you. It\u2019s your thoughts, your attitude, your emotions. It\u2019s who you spend time with, what you watch, what you listen to. That\u2019s your atmosphere. That\u2019s what you have control over. The scripture says, \u201cWhen you seek God first, all these things will be added unto you.\u201d He wants to not only meet your needs, He wants to give you the desires of your heart. It may be impossible to you, but it\u2019s not to our God. Start expecting His favor. Start believing that new levels are coming. Start talking like it\u2019s going to happen. When God closes a door, the longer you try to hold on, the more miserable you\u2019re going to be. You have to say goodbye to some things to keep moving forward. Just because you don\u2019t see anything happening on the outside doesn\u2019t mean something is not happening on the inside. You have to walk by faith and not by sight.  \n\nCheck out \"Believing When You're Not Seeing\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/2JThOTn8De You may have seen His blessings in the past, but you haven\u2019t touched the surface of what He has in store. The scripture says, \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen, heard, or imagined the amazing things God has for those that love Him.\u201d God is going before you right now: making crooked places straight, moving the wrong people out of the way, lining up the right people, arranging things in your favor. It would be much easier if we could see the promise on the way. If God would just let us see what He\u2019s up to, then we wouldn\u2019t doubt, but that wouldn\u2019t take faith. \n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Believing When You're Not Seeing\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/U2A4bnKYj4 What God has in store for you is going to amaze you. The people He\u2019s going to bring across your path, the influence He\u2019s going to give you, the places He\u2019s going to take you are far better than you can imagine. Every blessing, every healing, every breakthrough was not just designed for you; it was designed to strengthen others. If you\u2019ll tell what God has done, speak life and healing, share your skills, talents, resources, then there\u2019s no limit to how high God will take you. Don\u2019t be moved by what you don\u2019t see, by what you don\u2019t have, by who\u2019s against you. God being for you is more than the world being against you. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \"Believing When You're Not Seeing\". \n\nCheck it out here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/XLrjgQWLVU That problem you think will never turn around? He\u2019s already set up the answer; it\u2019s not a surprise to God. He had the solution before you had the problem. You can\u2019t make people do what\u2019s right. If you\u2019re trying to control everything, you\u2019re going to be frustrated. Turn it over to God. Do what you can, then let God take care of the rest. Will you get discouraged and quit believing or will you say, \u201cGod, I may not see anything happening, but I\u2019m not moved by what I see; I\u2019m moved by what I know. I know what you promised is on the way.\u201d  \n\nWatch, \"Believing When You're Not Seeing\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/l1BzjwdiXC Instead of considering how big your obstacle is, why don\u2019t you start considering how big your God is. He spoke worlds into existence; He flung stars into space. He can make things happen that you could never make happen. The scripture says, \u201cDon\u2019t get weary in well doing for, in due season, you will reap if you faint not.\u201d God says, if you won\u2019t get tired of doing the right thing, if you won\u2019t let what you don\u2019t see talk you out of what you know, then your due season is coming. You have to trust the process. You may not see what God is up to, but while you\u2019re waiting, things are growing, things are developing. \n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Believing When You're Not Seeing\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/wvz9V8cETC You may have situations that look like they\u2019ll never work out. If you only consider the circumstances, you\u2019ll get discouraged and give up. Don\u2019t consider your circumstances; consider your God. When you can see it, it doesn\u2019t take much faith. The test comes when you don\u2019t see any sign of what you\u2019re believing for. \n\nWatch Joel\u2019s new message this morning! \"Believing When You're Not Seeing\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/VYjPXNCWKA Our attitude should be, \u201cI know what God promised me is still alive. I\u2019m not moved by what I feel. I\u2019m not moved by what\u2019s not working out, by how long it\u2019s been, by what hasn\u2019t improved. I know what God started in my life He will finish.\u201d Many times, before a promise comes to pass, you have to go through a season of silence where you don\u2019t see anything changing. This is when many people give up on what they\u2019re believing for. But just because you don\u2019t see anything happening doesn\u2019t mean God is not working. You haven\u2019t seen your best days. You may not see how it can work out, but God has ways you\u2019ve never thought of. He\u2019s already lined up things in your future that will amaze you. If He told you right now, you couldn\u2019t fathom it. Stay in the waiting room. Keep a good attitude, keep growing, keep passing the test. What God has for you is on the way. When you see what God does, you\u2019re going to say it was worth the wait. You don\u2019t have to beg people to stay. You are a gift. You are a prize. You are exceptional. Let the wrong people go, and God will send people that value who you are and people that can\u2019t wait to be with you. You\u2019ve been designed for this time. You are equipped for what you\u2019re facing, empowered to fulfill your destiny. \n\nCheck out \"Stronger Than You Think\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/oGO271tbkZ God sees what you\u2019re going through. He knows how you feel. He knows what wasn\u2019t fair. He\u2019s about to send an abundant rain. Put your shoulders back, hold your head up high, and remember who you are and whose you are: a child of the Most High. Get in tune with Him. When you start seeing yourself as strong, empowered, well able, then you won\u2019t live overwhelmed. You\u2019ll discover strength that you didn\u2019t know you had. \n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Stronger Than You Think\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/J7eAzlrEMs Quit reliving mistakes you\u2019ve made, things you wish you had done differently, living in regrets, wondering why it didn\u2019t work out. You may have done your best, given it your all, but it didn\u2019t succeed. Accept it as God\u2019s plan and move on. Too often, we\u2019re letting small compromises, little things where we don\u2019t have integrity, keep us from the big things God has in store. The reason the pressure feels overwhelming is because you are stronger than you think. That difficulty is an opportunity to discover what\u2019s in you. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \"Stronger Than You Think\". \n\nCheck it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/uCM07Kduo9 A person of integrity does the right thing when no one is watching. You give it your best whether anyone is there or not. If you\u2019ll do the right thing, God will make it up to you. He\u2019s keeping the records. If you want to make God proud, stand strong, be courageous, think like a champion, talk like an overcomer, praise when you could be complaining, declare victory when all you see is defeat, expect favor when it seems impossible. God won\u2019t let you get in a situation if He hasn\u2019t already equipped you for it. If it were going to be too much to bear, too big to defeat, God wouldn\u2019t have allowed it. \n\nClick here to watch, \"Stronger Than You Think\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/Gxqvc039wy Don\u2019t be intimidated by how big the opposition is, by how bad the medical report looks, by how powerful the people are against you. You have the favor of God. You have can-do power; you are stronger than you think. See yourself as someone that\u2019s well able. The reason you face big challenges is because you have a big destiny. The reason you have great obstacles is because you have greatness in you. Don\u2019t let your feelings run your life. You have to go by what you know, not by what you feel. \n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Stronger Than You Think\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/8yrbXWyo3c Are you seeing yourself the right way? Have you discovered what\u2019s in you? That situation that seems overwhelming, that pressure that feels unbearable, it\u2019s not there to defeat you but to help you discover strength that you didn\u2019t know you had. God never gives up on us. You may think of all the reasons why you can\u2019t overcome, why that problem is too big, and how it\u2019s unbearable, but God is going to keep calling you a mighty hero. You\u2019ll never know how strong you really are until you face pressure that you\u2019ve never faced. It may seem unbearable, but the fact that God allowed it means that you can handle it. \n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today! \"Stronger Than You Think\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/AatXCDKR9j When God designed you, He took into account everything you would face\u2014every struggle, every unfair situation, every setback\u2014and He put in you the strength, the courage, the determination to withstand it. You have to stretch; get out of your comfort zone. If you\u2019ll say goodbye to the familiar, then you\u2019ll see the new things God has in store. You don\u2019t have to have favor with everyone, just favor with the right one. A dozen people may not like you, but they can\u2019t stop you. God has the right people that will open doors to blessings, favor, promotion. If you don\u2019t feel good about something, if you have to talk yourself into it, make excuses about why it\u2019s okay, then it\u2019s not worth it. You\u2019ll never go wrong taking the high road. Show God He can trust you, that you\u2019ll go the extra mile to do the right thing. You can set your family on a new course. The decisions you make will affect generations to come. It just needs someone to start a blessing, to start forgiveness. Why don\u2019t you let that be you? \n\nCheck out \"Start a Blessing\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/8MNEr2fvTU That problem is not going to defeat you, that trouble is not how your story ends, that loss is not going to define you. You\u2019re going to discover things in you that you didn\u2019t know you had. I believe strength is rising up, courage is rising up, dreams are coming back to life. Hebrews says, \u201cHold fast the confession of your faith.\u201d You have to hold fast to what God put in your heart. There are forces constantly trying to convince us that what God said is never going to happen. You\u2019re the one to start the blessing. You\u2019re the one to start the favor, to start freedom. God is counting on you to raise the bar, to take your family to a new level. \n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Start a Blessing\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/ACztvhFeUS When things cease, that\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re about to take new ground, walls are about to come down, giants are about to be defeated, you\u2019re going to step into favor, increase, healing, breakthroughs like you\u2019ve never seen. Quit worrying about who doesn\u2019t like you, how big your obstacles are. Quit thinking you can\u2019t accomplish your dreams. It\u2019s already set up; you\u2019re right on schedule. Start a blessing. Make your life count. You\u2019re affecting generations to come. \n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"Start a Blessing\". Check it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/xcxxRVC88O What you can\u2019t see is that the moment you prayed, in the unseen realm, the source of what was coming against you was cut off: the source of that fear, the source of the addiction, the source of the sickness. Let\u2019s start passing down good things. Let\u2019s live generously. Let\u2019s make it easier for those that come after us. Let\u2019s break any generational curse and start a generational blessing. When you\u2019re faithful, when you\u2019re generous, when you keep God first place, you start a blessing that you can\u2019t contain. \n\nClick here to watch, \"Start a Blessing\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/ZQzaMU9Qox What God has in mind is much bigger than what you have in mind. It\u2019s not going to be limited to your generation; it\u2019s going to get passed down to future generations. When you make decisions that honor God, when you\u2019re generous, when you\u2019re faithful, your life is not only going to be more rewarding, more fulfilling, but that faithfulness and obedience is being credited to your children, to future generations. Your obedience, your faithfulness, your generosity is not just going to cause you to see God\u2019s goodness, but you\u2019re impacting future generations. \n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Start a Blessing\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/8KvU0K6DD4 Don\u2019t get talked out of doing the right thing. Keep honoring God, keep giving, keep taking the high road, keep being good to people. You\u2019re storing up blessings, storing up mercy, storing up favor. It can start with you. You can be the one to set your family on a new course. You can start a blessing. You can start freedom; you can start abundance; you can start victory.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today! \"Start a Blessing\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/4Fhsqvjiu5 There\u2019s something called a generational blessing. God is keeping an account of every good thing you do. That\u2019s not being overlooked. It\u2019s accruing blessing, favor, mercy. The decisions we make don\u2019t just affect our lives; they affect generations to come. The way you live can make it easier for your children and grandchildren. You can be a stepping stone for them to do greater things. Where you\u2019re going, there will be opposition: critics and people that try to pull you down. The good news is no weapon formed against you will prosper. They can\u2019t stop you. What you\u2019re going through may not be fair. People may not be treating you right. It would be easy to get discouraged and live sour. But it\u2019s a test. God is seeing what you are going to do in the difficult times. I wonder where you could be at this time next year if you would start kissing things goodbye. Kiss the offense goodbye. Quit letting people hurt your feelings. Quit letting what they say ruin your day. Tune it out. When it comes to what God says, you have to have the boldness to believe it.\n\nCheck out \"I Declare\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/m4l9jSJe2O The people that stay happy, that don\u2019t fall into discouragement, that don\u2019t go downhill, are the people that rule over their thoughts, the people that keep their hopes up, the people that know God is still on the throne. Sometimes we\u2019re waiting for God to change the circumstances, but the truth is, God is waiting on you. Arise from that depression. Shake off the blahs. Shake off what hasn\u2019t worked out. This day is a gift. Who you are is a child of the Most High God. You were created to be free. Let that come alive on the inside. Let those words of faith ignite the freedom in your spirit.  \n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"I Declare\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/Lsf3L7vwei When you run out of strength, don\u2019t worry, angels are coming. Help is on the way. You\u2019re going to feel strength that you didn\u2019t have, joy when you could be discouraged, hope when you should be depressed. There are new levels in your future, but much of it is depends on how bad you want it. God is not going to do everything for us. We have to do our part. When you face obstacles, don\u2019t get discouraged. Know that God is fighting your battles. When people come against you, they may be more powerful, but know God is all-powerful.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"I Declare\".

You can\u2019t be moved by what you don\u2019t see; you have to be moved by what you know. God has good breaks in your future that are going to catapult you to a new level. Blessings that are going to thrust you into influence, resources, ability that you never imagined. I\u2019m declaring over you the year of God\u2019s favor. Receive the blessing. \u201cLord, I believe that You declared this is a year of Your favor.

If it was supposed to be yours, they couldn\u2019t have gotten it. Be happy for them, knowing that God has something better for you. Sometimes we feel like we have no more: no more strength, no more vision, no more health. That\u2019s okay. When you come to the end, that\u2019s when God steps in.

One touch of God\u2019s favor will put you fifty years down the road, not in age, but in influence, in position, in opportunity. God has ways we\u2019ve never thought of.

You realize God\u2019s getting you prepared to handle greater weight, greater favor, greater influence. What you\u2019re constantly talking about, you\u2019re drawing in. When you talk about the greatness of our God,  what He can do, declaring what He promised, then you\u2019re going to draw in favor, blessings, increase.

But that\u2019s when you have to dig down deep and say, \u201cNo, I\u2019m going to keep speaking victory.

That\u2019s important, but something happens when you speak: angels go to work, forces of darkness are broken, good breaks come looking for you. Are you taking time to declare God\u2019s goodness over your life? Are you speaking victory over your future? It\u2019s not enough to do it every once in a while. It needs to become a habit where, all through the day, we\u2019re declaring that we\u2019re blessed, we\u2019re strong, we\u2019re healthy.

You\u2019re going to become what you\u2019re continually saying. Life is fragile. Time is too short to live bitter, offended. God knows what you didn\u2019t get. He knows what wasn\u2019t fair. Quit trying to make people pay you back. Go to God and He\u2019ll make it up to you. Will you keep believing even when your situation looks impossible? Life will try to push you down, steal your dreams and talk you into settling for mediocrity, but if you will stay in faith and stir up what God\u2019s put on the inside, He will bring every promise to pass. Happy New Year! You may have been through some disappointments, but this is a new day. Your greatest victories are still out in front of you. This is your year for a fresh start. Dare to dream again; dare to have a big vision for your life. Trust God to bring it to pass. https://t.co/y92MuKG8Qg Don\u2019t get discouraged because you don\u2019t see anything changing.

It\u2019s already in your future. God said He always causes you to triumph. It may not turn out the way you thought or on your timetable, but God\u2019s ways are better than our ways.

God is not limited by what you don\u2019t have. He\u2019s not intimidated by how big the opposition is, by how bad the medical report looks, by what the financial statement says. Every thought may tell you, \u201cIt\u2019s permanent; it\u2019s never going to change.\u201d But God is saying to you today, \u201cI\u2019m going to do it quickly. It\u2019s going to happen suddenly.\u201d\n\nClick here to watch, \"It's Going to Happen Quickly\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/MnyYiv6sFU Does your vision increase around your friends or does it decrease?  Do you leave motivated, challenged, or are you discouraged, drained? Not every friend will inspire you, but you should have one or two that light a fire on the inside, that push you forward. Your times are in His hands. It may look like you\u2019re falling behind; the opposition is holding you back. No, stay encouraged. At the right time, that adversity is going to hurry out of your way. Red Seas can\u2019t keep you from your destiny. Don\u2019t be discouraged by how permanent that obstacle looks and how much more powerful it seems. You have an advantage.

If you\u2019ll be grateful where you are, then God can get you to where you want to be. Go through the day with expectancy; that\u2019s how you have continual joy.

Be on the lookout for who you can encourage. Victoria and I wish you and your family a Merry Christmas.

You can\u2019t change it on your own. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not just up to you. God is fighting for you. Don't miss this powerful message, \"The Fight For Your Future\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/3DTzc1zAVJ There are people God has in your life right now that need your healing. They need your love; they need your kindness. Be on the lookout. Live with the attitude, \u201cWho can I bless today? Who can I help heal? Who can I push into their destiny?\u201d What do you do in your times of pain? You can come out defeated, giving up on your dreams, or you can come out with a new fire, looking for the new opportunities in front of you. When you have a big future, the enemy is not going to roll out the red carpet and let you fulfill it.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"The Fight For Your Future\". Check it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/uk6yakKWzM It\u2019s time to step into who God created you to be. There is greatness in you. There are talents that you haven\u2019t discovered. Don\u2019t bury your talent; bury your fears and release your talent. Live faith-based, not fear-based. The enemy doesn\u2019t fight you for where you are; he fights you for where you\u2019re going. \n\nClick here to watch, \"The Fight For Your Future\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/nBiLvJUhJ6 The scripture says, \u201cStand still, and you will see the deliverance of the Lord.\u201d Keep doing the right thing, honoring God, and He\u2019ll take care of what\u2019s stopping you. He\u2019ll move people out of the way; He\u2019ll silence the opposition. The enemy wouldn\u2019t have wasted so much time and energy on you if there wasn\u2019t something amazing in front of you. Don\u2019t complain about what didn\u2019t work out. God is still working. He\u2019ll make up for what was unfair. He\u2019ll pay you back for the wrongs. When the enemy sees you start to make progress, he\u2019ll send the storm, the waves, the winds. That\u2019s when God will step up and say, \u201cPeace be still.\u201d\n\nListen now to this message from Joel, \"The Fight For Your Future\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/6rlueUv7Nr It doesn\u2019t have to be fair for God to do something remarkable. In fact, when it\u2019s not fair, when you\u2019re the underdog, when life has tried to stop you, that\u2019s when God will show out the most. Many of the challenges you\u2019ve faced\u2014the things that don\u2019t seem fair, the obstacles that came out of nowhere, the people that turned on you\u2014are because there\u2019s a history maker in you. You may not see it yet, but even the enemy can see that there\u2019s greatness in you. David said in Psalm 30, \u201cI praise You oh Lord, for You refused to let my enemies triumph over me.\u201d God\u2019s purpose is more powerful than the enemy\u2019s plan. Tune into Joel\u2019s message today! \"The Fight For Your Future\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 There is a fight for your future, but what I want you to see is that it\u2019s not your battle. God is fighting for you. The enemy may send the storm, opposition that looks too big, but don\u2019t worry; God controls the winds. He overrides every negative force. Don\u2019t go through life beating yourself up, thinking about everything you\u2019ve done wrong, dwelling on your mistakes and failures. The moment you asked God to forgive you, He forgave you. You may have seen His blessings in the past, but you haven\u2019t touched the surface of what He has in store. The scripture says, \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen, heard, or imagined the amazing things God has for those that love Him.\u201d God said in Psalms, \u201cTouch not My anointed.\u201d You are His anointed. When people come against you, they\u2019re not just messing with you; they\u2019re messing with the God who put the blessing on you. What God has blessed, no person can curse. If God is going to trust you with favor, influence, authority, you have to be a good steward of it.\n\nCheck out \"The Weight of Glory\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/MWErMZ4gub When you\u2019re on top of a mountain, the only way to go higher is to come down that mountain, go through the valley, and go up a bigger mountain. God allows valleys, not to hold us back, but because He\u2019s taking us higher. These challenges are all opportunities to come up higher. You\u2019re developing greater trust, greater confidence, greater endurance.\n\nClick here to watch, \"The Weight of Glory\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/dFMG7DSwVK None of us like difficulties, but when you understand that without the winter seasons you can\u2019t see greater growth, greater fruit then you won\u2019t complain. You realize God\u2019s getting you prepared to handle greater weight, greater favor, greater influence. You don\u2019t get stronger by taking the easy way out. You grow when you do things you don\u2019t like, when you do the right thing when the wrong thing is happening.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"The Weight of Glory\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/pnxkJnh67t Everything that happens in life\u2014the difficulties, the delays, the things that are not fair\u2014they\u2019re not random. God is giving you the opportunity to grow, to come up higher. He\u2019s getting you prepared to handle the weight of favor, the weight of influence. God uses difficulties and things we don\u2019t like to get us prepared. It\u2019s serving a purpose.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"The Weight of Glory\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/YyZvdFuHqj We grow during difficult times. We grow when we have to stretch our faith, believe when we don\u2019t see things changing. Those are very important times. If what you\u2019re praying about isn\u2019t changing, then God is using that situation to change you. Every day you stay in faith, every day you do your best, you can\u2019t see it, but your spiritual muscles are getting stronger. Your character is being developed. You\u2019re showing God that He can trust you. We have to pass some tests before God will trust us with the weight of glory\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today! \"The Weight of Glory\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/kgqUutbZ4f Glory means honor, favor, influence. We like those things, but we don\u2019t always realize there\u2019s a weight that comes with favor, a weight that comes with influence. If you\u2019re not prepared for it, the favor won\u2019t be a blessing; it will be a burden. When you don\u2019t see a way, instead of getting discouraged, you have to remind yourself, \u201cThe God we serve is not looking for a door; He\u2019s not hoping to find the door. He is the door.\u201d Healing comes when you get outside of yourself and help others. Comfort those that are going through what you\u2019ve been through. God knows what\u2019s in you; He knows what you\u2019re capable of. He\u2019s not going to let fear hold you back. He\u2019s not going to let how you were raised, what you didn\u2019t get, keep you from becoming who He created you to be. God knows how to make you invisible to your enemies. He didn\u2019t say we would never have problems, but He did promise that when trouble comes, He will hide you. \n\nCheck out \"Invisible to the Enemy\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/43nl0Jymyn Don\u2019t dwell on what you didn\u2019t get, what didn\u2019t work out. God is still working. He\u2019s a God of justice. He\u2019ll make up for what was unfair. He\u2019ll pay you back for the wrongs that were done. The enemy doesn\u2019t fight you for where you are; he fights you for where you\u2019re going. Trouble may have been sent your way, but it can\u2019t find you. Sickness may have shown up, but it\u2019s not permanent. God has you in a safe place.

New doors are about to open, giants are about to be defeated, talent is about to come out of you that you didn\u2019t know you had. You may have difficulties now, in your health, your finances, your marriage. You could live worried and panicked.

Stay in peace; you\u2019re invisible to the enemy. It may show up, but it\u2019s not going to find you. Faith and fear have something in common. They both ask us to believe something that we can\u2019t see. Whichever one you get in agreement with is the one that\u2019s going to come to pass. That difficulty is not how your story ends; God has the final say. He\u2019s not only going to take care of what\u2019s trying to stop you, but He\u2019s going to bring you out better. Trouble is not going to come near you. Why? You\u2019re in the shelter of the Most High. He has you covered. He\u2019s covered your health, covered your marriage, covered your children, covered your finances, covered your dreams. God can make you invisible to the enemy. Plans that were sent to stop you, strategies designed to keep you from your destiny, cannot stand against our God. God is your vindicator. He sees what\u2019s happening. If you\u2019ll stay on the high road, He\u2019ll make it up to you. If you\u2019ll get rid of the bitterness, the offense, the critical spirit, the negativity, you\u2019ll get your passion back; you\u2019ll get that spring in your step. You\u2019ll not only enjoy life more, but you\u2019ll see God\u2019s favor and blessings in new ways. You have to trust the process. While you\u2019re waiting, things are growing; things are developing. God is bringing it all together. God called you an eagle; He created you to soar.

The more they pull you back, the further God is going to take you. He has the final say. Bitterness will keep you from your destiny. It\u2019s going to pull you down into depression, steal your dreams, and rob you of your joy. You may have a good reason to be bitter, somebody hurt you, but holding on to the hurt is only going to make it worse. The one thing you can always control is your attitude.

The scripture says, \u201cRain falls on the just and the unjust.\u201d No one is exempt from difficulties. But if you\u2019ll stay in faith, that setback is setting you up for God to show out in your life.

You\u2019re doing yourself a disservice to go through a painful time and not come out with what you were supposed to gain. There\u2019s a lesson in the pain. Don\u2019t keep repeating the same mistakes. God parted Red Seas, He opened blind eyes, He brought water out of a rock, He caused Isaac to prosper in a famine, Sarah to have a baby at eighty years old, four lepers to defeat a huge army. He knows how to get you to your destiny. Yes, we\u2019ve all made mistakes, but you don\u2019t have to pay God back. The price has already been paid. Receive His forgiveness; receive His mercy. You have enough people in life against you; don\u2019t be against yourself. You\u2019re not just anyone; you belong to the Most High God.

You are still a son, a daughter of the Most High. You are forgiven, redeemed, restored, called, equipped, chosen, and anointed. Here\u2019s the key: the how is not as important as the who. When you know who you are, a child of the Most High God, crowned with favor, with royal blood flowing through your veins, then the who will override the how. God is working. The promise is growing. What God spoke to you is developing. You may not see anything improving, but if you\u2019ll stay in faith, what God said is on the way. What are you absolutely convinced of? It\u2019s not enough to just be convinced; you have to have a made-up mind. \u201cI will get well. I will beat this depression. I will get out of debt. I will accomplish my dreams.\u201d When the obstacle wasn\u2019t changing, what you didn\u2019t realize was that God was using the obstacle to change you. You were growing, getting stronger, learning patience. Instead of overflowing with doubt, worry, stress. Why don\u2019t you overflow with hope?

You\u2019ll see the new things He has in store. When it doesn\u2019t look hopeful, you don\u2019t see any sign of it happening, every thought says you\u2019re wasting your time, you have to dig down deep and against all hope, hope on in faith.

Him being for you is more than the world being against you. There\u2019s not an obstacle He can\u2019t move. There\u2019s not a sickness He can\u2019t heal, an addiction He can\u2019t free you from. Don\u2019t let the circumstances fool you. Surely, God is about to bless you and show you favor that you\u2019ve never seen.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"Overflow With Hope\".

When you keep hoping on in faith, you are paving the way for God to do extraordinary things. God doesn\u2019t ask us to figure it out. He doesn\u2019t ask us to come up with a plan, research it, see if it\u2019s possible. He simply asks us to believe. Get in agreement with what God has already promised.

Weeping may endure for a night, but you know joy is coming. God wouldn\u2019t have given you the promise, He wouldn\u2019t have put that dream in your heart, if He didn\u2019t have a way to make it happen. You have to dig down deep and against all hope, hope on in faith. Against the odds, dare to believe.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Overflow With Hope\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/tCHw5lmbiq Are you looking at how big your obstacles are, or are you looking at how big your God is? Your situation may seem impossible, like it could never work out, but one touch of God\u2019s favor, one good break, one healing, meeting one right person, and everything will change. God wouldn\u2019t have given you that dream, He wouldn\u2019t have put that promise in your heart, if He didn\u2019t have a way to make it happen.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today! \"Overflow With Hope\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/1DKglFPsSM It\u2019s easy to doubt; it\u2019s easy to give up on dreams. Doubters are a dime a dozen. God is looking for people that have a made-up mind, people that are convinced, people that overflow with hope, people that believe when the odds are against them, when they don\u2019t see a way. When you overflow with hope, you\u2019re not moved by what the circumstances look like. You\u2019re not discouraged because it hasn\u2019t happened yet. You\u2019re not worried because you don\u2019t see a way. You know God is on the throne. You have to be mature enough to know when to resist and when to rest. You\u2019re not supposed to fight every battle. God uses betrayals, closed doors, disappointments to move you into your purpose. You can\u2019t think defeat and have victory. You can\u2019t think weakness and have strength. Your life is going to follow your thoughts.\n\nGet a copy of Joel\u2019s NEW book \u201cEmpty Out The Negative\u201d for you and a friend: https://t.co/LJKn1wR4Eh\n\n#EmptyOutTheNegativeBook\n#JoelOsteen https://t.co/6QA1mIMxdi God knows what He\u2019s doing. He has you in the palm of His hand. He may not do it the way you had planned, but where He\u2019s taking you is better than you\u2019ve imagined. God is not finished. He wouldn\u2019t have let you get in that difficulty if He wasn\u2019t going to bring you out. Suddenly the waters will part, suddenly the winds will shift in your favor, suddenly the opposition will go away, suddenly the right people will show up. Unclutter your mind. Living guilty is not your destiny. Going around down on yourself, thinking your problems are too big, that is not who you were created to be. Quit remembering what God has forgotten. Quit telling Him how bad you are, how you messed up, and how you lost your temper. He forgave you way back when you asked. Start receiving God\u2019s mercy. Mercy covers your mistakes. Take inventory of what you\u2019re giving space to.

God works in mysterious ways. If you\u2019re trying to figure everything out, you\u2019re going to get frustrated.

Live it in peace; live it in faith. Anything you must have to be happy, the enemy can use it against you. When you can say, \u201cGod, this is what I want, but even if it doesn\u2019t work out my way, I\u2019m still going to be happy.\u201d That takes away the power of the enemy. You weren\u2019t created to carry around guilt, regret, bitterness, anger. You have to release it. When you do, you\u2019ll not only feel a new freedom, but God will be your vindicator.\n\nJoel\u2019s NEW book #EmptyOutTheNegativeBook is out today! https://t.co/LJKn1wR4Eh https://t.co/qa7jihpGSo If you\u2019re trying to control the outcome and control the timeframe, then you\u2019re going to live worried.

If that adversity were going to stop your destiny, God wouldn\u2019t have allowed it. If that disappointment were going to keep you from your purpose, it wouldn\u2019t have happened. God doesn\u2019t always take us down a straight path.

Sometimes it\u2019s taking longer because He has something better in store. One of the best things I\u2019ve learned is to trust God\u2019s timing and trust His ways.

That\u2019s why He\u2019s called the Great I Am. \u201cI Am whatever you need. I Am a door. I Am a key. I Am a way out.\u201d What do you need to accomplish the dream God put in your heart? It should be bigger than you can do on your own. If you can do it without calling anything in, then it\u2019s not big enough. We all have unfair things happen.

Other people can\u2019t keep you out of your purpose; obstacles can\u2019t keep you from what God has ordained for you. You may be doing a hard thing; you have to know God sees you.

That desert is not your destiny. That barren place, the disappointment, the loss is not how your story ends. The desert is temporary; the trouble is temporary; the depression is only temporary. In the drought, in the pandemic, you\u2019re going to see God show out in your life. That\u2019s what it means to have grass in the desert. You can\u2019t explain it; it doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s just the goodness of God. Pay attention to what you\u2019re allowing in your spirit. Just because there\u2019s strife and division, that doesn\u2019t mean it has to get in you. Stay on the high road. Don\u2019t take that bait. People can\u2019t stop what God has ordained. It\u2019s a test. Are you going to stand despite the opposition, are you going to stay in faith despite things not working out the way you thought, are you going to keep believing even though you\u2019ve had setbacks?

Dare to call in what He says about you. There may be something you know God has put in your heart, but if it happens too soon and you\u2019re not prepared, that blessing will turn into a burden.

Then we can live in faith, knowing that at the right time, God will get us to where we\u2019re supposed to be. We\u2019re interested in the destination, but God is interested in the journey. He\u2019s working on us along the way.\n\nClick here to watch, \"It's Worth the Wait\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/sVECUM0Ymg Here\u2019s a key. If what you\u2019re praying about isn\u2019t changing, then God is using the situation to change you. If it\u2019s not working out, then it\u2019s working out something in you. All things are working for your good. Keep a good attitude, keep growing, keep passing the test. What God has for you is on the way. When you see what God does, you\u2019re going to say it was worth the wait. He\u2019s a God who exceeds expectations. Live in faith, knowing that at the right time, God will get us to where we\u2019re supposed to be.\n\nListen now to this message from Joel, \"It's Worth the Wait\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/fj4hxbvARL It\u2019s very powerful when you can say, \u201cGod, I trust not only Your ways, but I trust Your timing. I know at the right time, when I\u2019m ready, when I can handle it, you\u2019ll take me to a new level of my destiny.\u201d Don\u2019t get discouraged when it\u2019s not happening as fast as you'd like. The longer it takes, that means the more God has in store. When it\u2019s your time, when God knows you\u2019re ready, what you give birth to is going to be much bigger than you think. If you\u2019ll wait with the right attitude, then after patience has done its work, you\u2019re going to see the promise come to pass.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s message today! \"It's Worth the Wait\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/Q4AomrKEYI You may not see anything changing, but something is happening; patience is working. You\u2019re getting stronger; you\u2019re growing, developing. Patience is building you, getting you prepared so you can sustain what God has coming. There\u2019s a lot of noise these days, a lot of drama, things we can get pulled into: worry, offense, doubt, jealousy. That may be around us, but it doesn\u2019t have to get in us. God is about to do a new thing. You\u2019re asking for the possible; God is going to do the impossible. You\u2019re believing for the ordinary; God is going to do the extraordinary. He\u2019s going to take you where you\u2019ve never been. You may have had unfair things happen: people left you out, tried to discredit you. God saw what happened. He\u2019s keeping the records. He hasn\u2019t forgotten about you. When you need it, God's grace is going to kick in and help you do what you didn't think you could do.\n\nPreorder your copy today!\n\n#EmptyOutTheNegative https://t.co/9wm3NtUe3T God calls us what we are before it happens.

All through the day, \u201cFather, thank You that You\u2019re going to exceed my expectations.\u201d Trust Him when you don\u2019t understand; be comfortable not knowing. The scripture says, \u201cLean not to your own understanding.\u201d God is not asking you to figure it out; He\u2019s just asking you to believe. Not only believe in Him, but believe in who He created you to be.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Who Do You Say You Are?\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/j0fi9CvNrK What God has spoken over you will come to pass. There are some things, even if you don\u2019t believe, God is still going to do. He is so merciful, so loving, that He\u2019s going to override your unbelief and do things that you never dreamed. What God has in store for you is going to amaze you. The doors He\u2019s going to open, the people He\u2019s going to bring across your path, the influence He\u2019s going to give you, the places He\u2019s going to take you are far better than you can imagine. What\u2019s trying to stop you doesn\u2019t have a chance. God being for you is more than the world being against you.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"Who Do You Say You Are?\". Check it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/DLWmh3YqFv Clear out the negative. You have enough people in life against you; don\u2019t be against yourself. Who do you say you are: average, limited, disadvantaged, not able to? That will keep you from your destiny. Instead of letting people define you, instead of letting your past label you, why don\u2019t you go back to what God says about you. He\u2019s the one that made you. You can\u2019t say I\u2019m weak and tap into the power. You can\u2019t say I\u2019ll never get ahead and tap into the abundance. You can\u2019t say I\u2019m not talented and tap into your greatness. \n\nClick here to watch, \"Who Do You Say You Are?\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/9rSJWsTnXS The enemy is called the accuser. He\u2019ll remind you of every mistake you\u2019ve made, every time you\u2019ve failed. He\u2019d love for you to wear negative labels: unworthy, washed up, no future. Don\u2019t wear those labels. Say what God says about you, \u201cI\u2019m forgiven, I\u2019m redeemed, I\u2019m restored.\u201d God didn\u2019t make anyone average. Nobody has your fingerprints; nobody can do what you can do. But as long as you believe you\u2019re ordinary, you won\u2019t shine like you\u2019re supposed to shine. Hold your head up high and step up to who you were created to be.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Who Do You Say You Are?\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/d8bjOJ4eUn You are not who people say you are; you are who God says you are. People can\u2019t always see what God put in you; they can\u2019t see the potential, the gifts, the greatness. Don\u2019t let people put their limitations on you and convince you that you can\u2019t accomplish your dream. You don\u2019t know where God is taking you. You don\u2019t know the doors He\u2019s going to open, the giants you\u2019re going to defeat, the influence you\u2019re going to have. There\u2019s an awesome future in front of you, but it\u2019s dependent on how you see yourself. The only voice that matters is your voice. Who do you say you are?  What you say is what you will become.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today! \"Who Do You Say You Are?\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/F3FPwpXJKA Instead of letting people define you, instead of letting circumstances label you, you need to go back to what God said about you. God says, \u201cYou can do all things through Christ. You\u2019re equipped and empowered.\u201d You\u2019re not on your own. The Creator of the universe is working out His plan for your life. His job is to open doors we can\u2019t open, His job is to part Red Seas, His job is to make things happen that we can\u2019t make happen. God rewards faithful people: people that don\u2019t give up, people that don\u2019t let a disappointment cause them to be sour, people that don\u2019t let a setback, a loss, a delay stop their destiny.\n\nCheck out \"Travel Steadily\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/uhDs7zRBZa Don\u2019t get discouraged by what\u2019s not changing. Instead, let that challenge you to call it in even stronger. God is faithful to what He promised. When you\u2019re calling in what He has spoken over you, then you can rest assured it\u2019s on the way. If you don\u2019t do it for yourself, do it for those that went before you. They handed you the baton. All of their sacrifices have put us much further down the road. The way to honor their legacy is to go further, to dream big. God doesn\u2019t ask us to figure everything out. You have to know what\u2019s your job and what\u2019s God\u2019s job. Our job is to believe, our job is to thank God, our job is to walk in obedience.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Travel Steadily\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/Z8D93rjqXU You are not a sick person trying to get well; you\u2019re a well person fighting off sickness. You\u2019re not an addicted person trying to get free; you\u2019re a free person fighting off addictions. It may be there now, but it\u2019s in the process of leaving. That obstacle may look big, that giant may look impossible, but God can do the impossible. Now, stay encouraged. You can defeat your giants. If you\u2019re going to go from anointed to appointed, you have to keep thanking God when you don\u2019t see anything happening, praising when you could be complaining. \n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"Travel Steadily\". Check it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/ikfjkBua22 It\u2019s not enough to just hope something will happen, just believe a dream will come to pass, just think positive and that situation will turn around. You have to take the next step and call it in. Words give life to our faith. The key is to not be impatient. It may not happen as fast as you would like. While you\u2019re waiting, that\u2019s a test. Show God that you\u2019re not going to give up on your dream, you\u2019re not going to let what didn\u2019t work out cause you to lose your passion. When God gives you a promise, there will always be a waiting period. What we do while we\u2019re waiting will determine whether the promise will come to pass.\n\nClick here to watch, \"Travel Steadily\": https://t.co/kMfAhXoPj9 https://t.co/oTLU4wxCTg Nothing that has happened to you is a surprise to God. He\u2019s ordering your steps. If the door closed, it was supposed to close. If the person walked away, they were supposed to walk away. Don\u2019t get bitter; keep traveling steadily. Sometimes the reason it\u2019s taking so long is because what God has for you is bigger than you\u2019ve imagined. He\u2019s getting you prepared to carry the weight of the blessing, the weight of the influence. Your increase, your favor, your abundance is not in where you\u2019ve been; it\u2019s where God is taking you.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Travel Steadily\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/kxTB7xeq7L To see promises come to pass, you have to keep traveling steadily. You have to do the right thing when nobody is watching; you have to be your best when you\u2019re not getting the credit; you have to thank God even though doors aren\u2019t opening. God never promised things would turn around instantly and come to pass in two weeks. Sometimes, there will be a waiting period. Don\u2019t be impatient; God rewards faithful people that keep doing the right thing. Everything may not be perfect, you\u2019re dealing with challenges, but you\u2019re consistently thanking God, consistently declaring His promises, consistently expecting His favor. That\u2019s what it means to travel steadily. As long as you\u2019re worried, trying to make things happen in your own strength, that will limit what God will do. The Psalmist said, \u201cBe still and know that He is God.\u201d Clear out the worry, clear out the offense, clear out the negativity. God has already given you an assignment, He\u2019s already called you, and He\u2019s not going to change His mind. You may make mistakes, get off course, do things that you know you shouldn\u2019t, but that doesn\u2019t change your calling. God wants to make you an example of His goodness. When He exceeds your expectations, people are going to take notice. They\u2019re going to see the favor on your life. You\u2019re going to have a new respect, a new level of influence. Life is short; time is flying by. You have to make a decision. Are you going to stay comfortable or are you going to step into your calling?\n\nCheck out \"Calling Over Comfort\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/4VeQdVvOuR You can\u2019t hold on to the hurts, live offended, bitter, and see the new things God has in store. You have to clear out the clutter; that\u2019s what makes room for God to give you the beauty. You don\u2019t have to know how it's going to happen as long as you know Who is in control of your life. That\u2019s when the Creator of the universe will open doors you couldn\u2019t open, break chains that have held you back, bring dreams to pass that seemed impossible. Here\u2019s the key, if you never try, you\u2019re never going to know. There are no risks in playing it safe.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Calling Over Comfort\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/kwbvEVjmfX God knew there would be times we wouldn\u2019t have the faith we need to reach our destiny. But God said, \u201cIf you\u2019ll just have a little bit of faith, that\u2019s all you need. Then, I\u2019ll do my part. I\u2019ll exceed your expectations.\u201d When you go through a disappointment, something doesn\u2019t work out, you can hold on to it and live discouraged, or you can let it go and say, \u201cGod, I know You have something better. I know Your plans for me are for good.\u201d The fear may still be there, but you have to act on your purpose and not your fear. Fear will keep you from your destiny. You may feel fear, but you have to do it afraid. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \"Calling Over Comfort\".\n\nCheck it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/PmhUWDYU4c Sometimes we think it\u2019s a lack of faith to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d We think we have to have all the answers, have it all figured out. Take the pressure off. You don\u2019t have to know; God knows. He has you in the palm of His hand. He\u2019s directing your steps. We all have destiny moments. That opportunity is not going to pass by again. If you let fear keep you in your comfort zone, people didn\u2019t stop your destiny; you stopped your destiny. I\u2019m asking you to choose your calling over your comfort. Don\u2019t let the comfort keep you from the calling. Where God is taking you is going to require risks. You\u2019re going to have to leave what\u2019s familiar and step into the unknown.\n\nClick here to watch, \"Calling Over Comfort\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/5nMVtnc5I6 The reason you feel that stirring in your spirit, the reason something is coming alive on the inside, is because God is calling you. He\u2019s been waiting for you. This is a destiny moment. The question is, will you leave your comfort and step into your calling? God wouldn\u2019t have given you the opportunity, He wouldn\u2019t have told you to rise and walk, if you couldn\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t let comfort hold you back. Being comfortable will keep you from your potential. You were created to stretch. You were created to go further. You can be at the right place, in the wrong frame of mind, and miss your miracle. \n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Calling Over Comfort\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/UNHQo6g4cN Don\u2019t let fear hold you back: fear of what people are going to think. If they\u2019re not for you, then you don\u2019t need them. Your destiny is not dependent on everyone being for you. Anytime God is going to do something new in your life, give you more influence, more favor, more anointing, more resources, there\u2019s going to be a test of being uncomfortable. Are you willing to stretch, to do something you\u2019ve never done? If you\u2019re never uncomfortable, you\u2019re not growing. If you never have to stretch your faith, then you\u2019re going to be limited.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today! \"Calling Over Comfort\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/d7yQt99rSd Are you going to choose to stay comfortable, or are you going to step out in faith and take a risk? If you\u2019ll leave the comfort and come into your calling, God will make things happen that you couldn\u2019t make happen. Doors will open that you couldn\u2019t open. Quit telling yourself, \u201cI can\u2019t do this. It\u2019s too early; it\u2019s too hard. I\u2019ve had too many setbacks.\u201d You can do what you want to do. Don\u2019t miss your destiny because you didn\u2019t want it bad enough. God has not failed in the past; He\u2019s not going to start with you. Keep on walking, believing, praying, doing the right thing. Waters are about to part, doors are about to open, problems are about to turn around. The scripture says, \u201cFaith without works is dead.\u201d You have to go after what God has for you. God being for you doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t have opposition. The enemy wouldn\u2019t be trying to stop you if you weren\u2019t a threat to him.\n\nCheck out \"Keep on Walking\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/mno9XLwUPV You are made in the image of Almighty God. He calls you a masterpiece. You have something to offer that nobody else has. When the odds are against you and you don\u2019t see how it could work out, don\u2019t get discouraged. Remind yourself: tomorrow will be better than today. That\u2019s not just being positive. The scripture says, \u201cThe path of the righteous gets brighter and brighter.\u201d Things you\u2019ve been standing in faith for are about to come to pass. It\u2019s not going to be ordinary; it\u2019s going to be the hand of God.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Keep on Walking\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/VI1k5UKcQ4 Put your faith out there.

When it comes to guidance and direction, it\u2019s important to ask God to show us His will. That\u2019s honoring God, showing our dependence on Him. You have a unique anointing; there\u2019s a distinct calling on your life. You don\u2019t have to copy someone else.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"Keep on Walking\". Check it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/o7PxD5CXJp Your destiny is too important to spend it with people that are not making you better. Who are you allowing to influence you? Are they inspiring you, challenging you, pushing you forward? God will often wait until the experts say there\u2019s no way, the odds are against you. So, when He turns it around, everyone will know it was His favor, His power, His goodness in your life. What God asks us to do, doesn\u2019t always make sense. His ways are not our ways. Many times, it\u2019s simply a test. If you\u2019ll obey, the miracle will follow.\n\nClick here to watch, \"Keep on Walking\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/ArqoTyQWKp God hears your prayers. He sees your faithfulness. He sees you believing when you don\u2019t see things changing, thanking Him when you could be complaining. Your time is coming. You wouldn\u2019t be reading this if God didn\u2019t have breakthroughs coming your way. Faith makes room for provision. You can\u2019t wait till it happens; you have to make room for it when you don\u2019t see any sign of it. You have to talk like it\u2019s on the way, plan like it\u2019s on the way, think like it\u2019s on the way. You have to believe it before you see it. You have to act like it\u2019s on the way when you don\u2019t see any sign of it.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Keep on Walking\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/53ADY9835x You weren\u2019t created to retreat; you weren\u2019t created to run from the opposition. You have armor for one direction\u2014to keep moving forward. When you stand strong and fight the good fight of faith, the opposition will run from you. Don\u2019t let the enemy talk you out of your Promised Land. God has bigger things in your future. He has new mountains for you to climb. We serve a big God. He flung stars into space; He spoke worlds into existence. He can get you to where you\u2019re supposed to be.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today! \"Keep on Walking\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/oDr9ZVbWcx Just because you don\u2019t see anything doesn\u2019t mean God is not working. As you keep believing, keep praising, keep doing the right thing, you\u2019re going to see things begin to change. Many times the miracle is in the process. What you\u2019re believing for is still on the way. That\u2019s a key to faith, trusting when you don\u2019t understand, trusting when you don\u2019t have the answers, trusting when it seems like it\u2019s just the opposite of what you were hoping. Declare your healing. Declare your freedom. Declare your dreams are coming to pass. Jesus said, \u201cIf you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain move and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.\u201d You could live worried, upset, but no. Be still and know that He is God. You don\u2019t have to be God. You don\u2019t have to figure it out. You don\u2019t have to come up with the solution. God is on the throne. God says because you keep him first place, you will lend and not borrow. You will be above and not beneath. Whatever you touch will prosper and succeed.\n\nCheck out Joel's new message on Podcast here! https://t.co/7QEhqMzuNY https://t.co/qZNa7SSJ6c We remember and honor all those who lost their lives, their loved ones, and those who fought to save lives with courage on September 11, 2001. https://t.co/LVPgJbpllH Are you living worried, discouraged, fearful? That\u2019s taking up space for the good things that belong to you. In this new book, Joel shows you how to empty out the negative so you can have better relationships, greater joy, more creativity and live your best life. https://t.co/aywvAvFn73 God\u2019s ways are not our ways. Sometimes He doesn\u2019t want you to know. It\u2019s a test of your faith. Will you trust Him or will you live worried, stressed, wondering how it\u2019s going to work out? Get in agreement with God. He can give you light without sun, water without rain, healing without a source\u2014wherein the natural, there\u2019s no explanation.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/WPmihCouzd God is so merciful, even when we don\u2019t have the faith, even when we think we\u2019ve reached our limits, God says, \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019m going to show you My favor in spite of that.\u201d You weren\u2019t created to live worried, guilty, upset, bitter. If you\u2019re going to reach your destiny, you have to clear out the clutter. You can\u2019t stop negative things from coming, but you can keep them from staying. You don\u2019t have to hold on to it. You have to talk like it\u2019s already happened. There may not be any sign of it, but that is what faith is all about.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel. Check it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/3Zw45rzHf6 You may have some things you don\u2019t understand, you can\u2019t figure out, you don\u2019t see an answer. That\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to see it. Don\u2019t get discouraged; don\u2019t start complaining. God is working behind the scenes. Declare your vision in spite of what the experts are telling you. People don\u2019t determine your destiny. They don\u2019t know what God put in you. Don\u2019t let their negative words keep you from speaking your positive, faith-filled words. If you keep speaking it, you will become what you\u2019re saying. You are prophesying your future. Listen to the words coming out of your mouth. It\u2019s not enough to just believe you have favor, believe that you\u2019re blessed, believe that you\u2019re going to fulfill your dreams. The scripture says the spirit of faith is in our words. Words are like seeds. Every time you say them, they\u2019re taking root, they\u2019re growing. The scripture says, \u201cYou will eat the fruit of your words.\u201d\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/q7XP5ty8bk You can\u2019t speak defeat and have victory. You can\u2019t speak lack and have abundance. You can\u2019t speak sickness and have health. Get in the habit of speaking faith-filled words. God has spoken promises to your spirit that may seem too big, impossible. You don\u2019t have the connections, the experience, the funds. Don\u2019t talk yourself out of the miracle. Get in agreement with God. Dare to declare what He put in your heart. Our words have creative power. When we speak something out, we\u2019re giving it the right to come to pass.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today!  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/Irbw2wOofi We give life to whatever we speak out. If you start speaking negative, agreeing with the doubt, talking about how big the problem is, then you\u2019re giving life to the wrong things. Your words can keep you from your destiny. You may have had some setbacks, things didn\u2019t work out, but you have to be relentless when it comes to what God put in your heart. If you let people, a closed door, or a delay talk you out of it, then you didn\u2019t want it bad enough. When you believe that God wants to show out in your life, when you have the boldness to ask, then God will display His awesome power through you, and other people will notice. Stay faithful where you are; keep a good attitude when things are not happening as fast as you would like. David said, \u201cGod, my times are in Your hands.\u201d God knew we would make mistakes. He\u2019s not going to just redeem you; He\u2019s going to redeem the time. He\u2019s going to give you another chance.\n\nCheck out \"Time Is On Your Side\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/01Kl5vZXy0 You don\u2019t have time to waste with people that bring out the worst in you. Life is flying by. We don\u2019t get a do-over. This is it. \u201cWhat if I hurt their feelings?\u201d What if you miss your destiny? What if they keep you from becoming all you were created to be? Pray from a place of victory, pray from a place of confidence, not begging God, not trying to convince Him, but thanking Him for what He\u2019s already promised. The truth is that what God has for you is still on the way. Those years you were dealing with depression, the joy that should have been yours is still coming.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Time Is On Your Side\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/4b2Oeowycw If you\u2019re overwhelmed by problems, and you let circumstances push you down and people talk you out of it, then you\u2019re not going to have the courage and strength to sustain where God is taking you. The dreams God put in your heart, the promises He\u2019s spoken to you are not going to come to pass without opposition, delays, people trying to talk you out of it. If you\u2019re going to reach your destiny, you have to have a made-up mind. Nothing can stand against our God. When He comes down to deliver you, all the forces of darkness cannot stop Him.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"Time Is On Your Side\". Check it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/Ke79Hqvp0h We think of waiting as negative: we don\u2019t like it, nothing is happening. We\u2019re interested in the destination, but God is interested in the journey. He\u2019s working on us along the way. When God decides to bless you, He\u2019ll show you mercy that you didn\u2019t deserve, favor that you didn\u2019t earn. It wasn\u2019t anything you did; it was simply the favor of God. God sees the years you\u2019ve lost. He knows the pain, the hurt, what wasn\u2019t fair. The beauty of our God is He doesn\u2019t just heal the wounds; He restores the years. He makes up for what wasn\u2019t fair.\n\nClick here to watch, \"Time Is On Your Side\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/x1HiMzmdt3 We all want to rise higher, accomplish dreams, overcome obstacles, but as long as we\u2019re only focused on ourselves, we\u2019ll get stuck. God brings people and opportunities across our path so we can be a blessing. This is your chance to step up to a new level, your chance to break the addiction, to make your marriage great. God is going to cause you to accomplish more in less time. This is a window where God is going to give you the opportunity to finish what you started. You don\u2019t have to live with regrets, thinking you missed your season. God is going to restore opportunities that you missed, restore relationships, restore the years that you lost.\n\nTune in now to, \"Time Is On Your Side\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/sxifGeGB0I God is going to give you another chance. Don\u2019t believe those lies that you\u2019re too old, you\u2019ve made too many mistakes. You wouldn\u2019t be hearing this if God weren\u2019t about to restore the years. He\u2019s about to make up for that harvest that you missed. It may feel like you\u2019re running out of time, but God wouldn\u2019t have planned out your days, He wouldn\u2019t have given you a destiny and then not given you the time to fulfill it. All those years you prayed, those years you believed, those years you did the right thing, you worked hard, you helped others; that harvest has been stored up.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today! \"Time Is On Your Side\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/N3rZbw6qUS It\u2019s said that time is the one thing that we can\u2019t get back. That\u2019s true in the natural, but we serve a supernatural God. He knows how to make up for lost time. Too often, we\u2019re fighting when we should be resting. We\u2019re standing when we should be sitting. You need to have faith that God is in control. Sometimes we\u2019re waiting on God to bring us up higher, but God is waiting for us to bring our thinking up higher. Don\u2019t reduce what God put in your spirit to fit your faith; stretch your faith. After all God has done, handpicked you for this time, put His DNA in you, crowned you with His favor, don\u2019t go through life thinking you\u2019re ordinary.\n\nCheck out \"You Are Good Seed\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/3rcFXGhPLk It\u2019s very freeing when you learn this principle: there are some things we\u2019re not supposed to know. That\u2019s not a lack of faith; it\u2019s just the opposite. You\u2019re taking yourself off the throne and putting God on the throne. It may take a little time to see it come to pass, but it\u2019s on the way. Don\u2019t get talked out of it. Don\u2019t let what\u2019s not happening discourage you. Keep believing, keep thanking God, and you\u2019re going to see what God has spoken over your life. We all face challenges in life. The key is to rise above the turmoil. Don\u2019t let it get on the inside. Remain at rest. Keep your seat and God will fight your battles. Quit being discouraged by what you see. What you see is subject to change. You don\u2019t know what God is up to. You don\u2019t know what He\u2019s doing behind the scenes. The promise God put in you is not going to come through someone else. God didn\u2019t create you to be dependent on others to fulfill your destiny. There is greatness in you. There are gifts, talents, businesses. You\u2019re about to blossom in an amazing way. You wouldn\u2019t have that difficulty if God weren\u2019t about to do something awesome in your life.\n\nClick here to watch, \"You Are Good Seed\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/NS1MKBxWEZ God is getting you ready to go higher, to see new levels of influence and favor. Don\u2019t complain about the difficult times; that\u2019s when you discover what\u2019s in you. If you\u2019ll keep the right attitude, the pressure, instead of breaking you, it will develop you. God doesn\u2019t have you here just to take up space. There\u2019s an assignment for you to accomplish. Something that only you can do. Without stepping into your purpose, this world will not be what it should be. Sometimes life stinks. We think these negative circumstances are going to stop us, but have a new perspective: it\u2019s fertilizer. It\u2019s not working against you; it\u2019s working for you.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"You Are Good Seed\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/8YsrW2MGjS It may be uncomfortable, but it\u2019s developing your character. It\u2019s giving you endurance. It\u2019s getting you prepared to blossom, in position to see the greatness of God. Instead of focusing on what you don\u2019t have, how big the obstacles are, start focusing on the fact that you\u2019re a person of destiny. The Creator of the Universe handpicked you for this particular time. It\u2019s your time to shine. It\u2019s your time to step into new levels. You are good seed. God has crowned you with favor; you have royal blood flowing through your veins. You wouldn\u2019t be here if you weren\u2019t equipped, empowered, and anointed.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today! \"You Are Good Seed\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/Oc41OvhE4L Don\u2019t let the accuser convince you that you\u2019ve blown it too many times, that you don\u2019t measure up. God is saying to you today, \u201cI\u2019ve approved you. My hand of favor is on you. I have forgiveness for your mistakes, mercy for your failures, favor for your future.\u201d Recognize His goodness in your life. Remember how He led you through the desert, how you met that person, how He brought you out of that problem, how He opened that door. It wasn\u2019t a lucky break; it was the Lord your God. One of the saddest things is to come to the end of life and wonder what we could have become. You can start today. There\u2019s still time. You can still become who God created you to be. The question is, do you want it bad enough? Don\u2019t be impatient for God to act. Don\u2019t be frustrated by what\u2019s not happening. God is working. You\u2019re in the waiting room. You\u2019re being prepared for what God has prepared for you. There are promises you need to activate. The promise on its own won\u2019t do you any good. It\u2019s just a hopeful statement. It needs another ingredient: your faith.\n\nCheck out \"Mix Your Faith\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/gfZnfgQQpf Thank God for the open doors and thank Him for the closed doors. Thank Him for the people that stood with you and thank Him for those that walked away. You may not have liked it, but they weren\u2019t part of your destiny. You didn\u2019t need them to become who you were created to be. When God sees you doing all that you can, then He\u2019ll make things happen that you can\u2019t. But if you\u2019re not willing to do the natural, He\u2019s not going to do the supernatural. You don\u2019t have to see how it\u2019s going to happen. God has ways you\u2019ve never thought of. All you have to do is get in agreement with Him.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Mix Your Faith\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/RBNBylSOsw The people that succeed don\u2019t always have the most talent, the most education, the most opportunity. Many times, they simply want it more than others. I want to light a fire in you today. You have to go after what God has for you. Are you letting people talk you out of what God put in your heart? Do yourself a favor and ignore what they\u2019re telling you. Let that go in one ear and out the other. They don\u2019t determine your destiny; God does. There\u2019s nothing more powerful than when you mix your faith with the promise. That\u2019s when angels go to work, that\u2019s when miracles are set in motion.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"Mix Your Faith\". Check it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/2yZ5KDXukJ The reason it\u2019s taking a long time for you is because what you\u2019re carrying is not something small. You\u2019re about to give birth to something that you didn\u2019t know was in you. God\u2019s about to open a door that you didn\u2019t see coming. When you believe, angels go to work. When you believe, supernatural doors will open. When you believe, you\u2019ll defeat giants. When you believe, you\u2019ll accomplish dreams much bigger than you thought. When you mix your faith with the promises, powerful things happen. A little match can start a huge fire. A little faith can start a huge blessing.\n\nLittle faith can open big doors. Click here to watch, \"Mix Your Faith\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/HW3TRKfMvo The scripture says, \u201cWithout faith, it\u2019s impossible to please God.\u201d He doesn\u2019t necessarily need your talent, your ability, your education. He needs your faith. He needs you to get in agreement with Him, to take that promise and believe it will come to pass. Even though God is all-powerful, even though He controls the universe, He needs your faith. He needs you to get in agreement with Him, to take that promise and believe it will come to pass. Faith ignites the promise. Like a match, even though it\u2019s small, even though it doesn\u2019t look like much, it\u2019s powerful. There\u2019s fire in the match.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Mix Your Faith\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/RLPwBsmXKx Dare to believe what God told you. Don\u2019t be moved by what you don\u2019t see, by how long it\u2019s taking, by how bad it looks, by what you don\u2019t have. Don\u2019t let those negative thoughts override what God has spoken to you. Mix in your faith. Little faith can defeat great giants. Little faith can open big doors. Don\u2019t believe that you don\u2019t have enough faith. You have the faith you need to get you to your destiny. Now do your part and start mixing faith with the promises. The promise alone is not enough. God does His part, then He waits to see what we\u2019re going to do. What are you going to mix with the promise?\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today! \"Mix Your Faith\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/gPymZ5EBAE God has given us powerful promises in the scripture. But, as powerful as these promises are, as encouraging and inspiring as they can be, there\u2019s only one ingredient that activates the power, one ingredient that ignites what God said, and that\u2019s faith. There are a lot of things in life we can\u2019t change, but we can change our approach. We can choose to not let things upset us, not go through life worried, frustrated, discouraged. On purpose, remember what God said. Thank Him that He\u2019s making a way; thank Him that He always causes you to triumph. Thank Him that what was meant for your harm, He\u2019s turning for your good. You weren\u2019t created to live in dysfunction, with addictions, constantly struggling. God\u2019s about to do a new thing. That sickness is not permanent; healing is coming. Wholeness is on the way; victory is in your future. You have to change your focus from what you see to what God said. You have to walk by faith and not by sight.\n\nCheck out \"Remember What God Said\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/T7TQrklSvS Here\u2019s a key, don\u2019t reduce what God\u2019s promised you to fit your faith. Don\u2019t bring it down to your level; come up to His level. Don\u2019t be limited by your faith; stretch your faith. Don\u2019t waste your time worrying; God is on the throne. He\u2019s promised to work out His plan for your life. His plan is better than your plan. When life is stressful\u2014you have a setback in your finances, you\u2019re struggling with depression\u2014don\u2019t let those negative thoughts drown out what God promised.\n\nListen to this powerful message, \"Remember What God Said\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/UpGFDY1DEA God knows how to defeat the giants; He knows how to turn things around. No person can stand against Him: no sickness, no addiction, no obstacle. You can\u2019t be a people pleaser and reach your potential. People will try to squeeze you into what they\u2019re used to, into what they think. Take advice, listen to counsel, but you may have to disappoint a few people to reach your destiny. When you remember what God said, you won\u2019t be worried; you\u2019ll have peace in the midst of the storm. You\u2019ll have faith to believe for the impossible.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"Remember What God Said\". Check it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/ESDpEKNCbL The promise is not that you won\u2019t have difficulties; the promise is God will bring you out, not of some of them, not of most of them, but out of all of them. God has you in the palm of His hand. He has not brought you this far to leave you. That loss, the breakup, yes it\u2019s painful, but it didn\u2019t stop your destiny. God has a new beginning. The economy is not your source; God is your source. You\u2019re connected to a supply line that will never run dry.\n\nClick here to watch, \"Remember What God Said\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/kcmTEbUbsY Why don\u2019t you start thanking God for what He told you instead of letting the negative thoughts play? The reason we\u2019re sometimes discouraged is we\u2019ve forgotten what He\u2019s said. It\u2019s not complicated. Go back to His promises. Quit dwelling on the hurts and start dwelling on what God promised you. God is saying, \u201cDid not I tell you, I will give you beauty for those ashes. Did not I tell you that I will pay you back double for the unfair things that have happened?\u201d Thank Him that He\u2019s making a way where you don\u2019t see a way. Thank Him that He always causes you to triumph.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Remember What God Said\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/l38fBzWKgw Don\u2019t focus on the winds, the waves, the impossibilities. Focus on what God said. Let His promises play in your mind. The dream that He put in your heart, every day, thank Him for it. Dare to believe that it\u2019s on the way. When we\u2019re under pressure, the mistake we often make is we go by what we see instead of by what God said. As long as you go by what you see, you\u2019re going to be worried and stressed. You have to start going by what God said. If you\u2019re going to stay in faith, you have to remember what God said. Go back to His promises. Start thanking Him for what He told you. Start declaring favor, victory, healing.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today! \"Remember What God Said\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/1Ffl0VTVzp What you\u2019re up against may seem impossible, but God created you to defy the odds. He created you to go further than people say you can go. He created you to defeat giants. When you honor God, you are connected to a supply line that will never run dry. You\u2019re not at the mercy of the economy or who likes you or what your boss does. God has all kinds of resources He can use. Perhaps today, you don\u2019t feel like you have the strength to move forward, the strength to fight the illness, the strength to raise your children. Remember, when you are weak, He is strong. If what you\u2019re praying about isn\u2019t changing, then God is using the situation to change you. If it\u2019s not working out, then it\u2019s working out something in you. All things are working for your good. God is reenergizing you with fresh passion, fresh vision. You will run and not be weary; you will walk and not faint.\n\nCheck out \"Special Strength is Coming\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/1qgOn10a3h Don\u2019t have a weak mentality; have a warrior mentality. You have to be more determined than the opposition. If you give up every time things don\u2019t go your way, you don\u2019t want it bad enough. Stay amazed at what God has done in your life. Go back over the times He\u2019s made a way, the times He protected you and brought you out of that trouble. When you\u2019re down, when you\u2019re discouraged, God is not going to leave you there. He\u2019ll always have someone to help lift you back up.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Special Strength is Coming\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/xgxFXSwoA4 How bad do you want what God put in your heart? Bad enough to outlast your enemies, bad enough to overlook some insults, bad enough to do the right thing when the wrong thing is happening? You may not see anything changing, but something is happening: patience is working.  Your spiritual muscles are getting stronger; you\u2019re growing, developing. Patience is building you, getting you prepared so you can sustain what God has for you. You wouldn\u2019t be reading this if special strength wasn\u2019t on the way. God hasn\u2019t forgotten about you. He sees what you\u2019re going through.

He\u2019s not going to let you get so discouraged that you can\u2019t become who you were created to be. God is about to lift you. He\u2019s breathing victory into your spirit, encouragement, and hope. Take a break from telling God everything that\u2019s wrong. He already knows your needs. There\u2019s nothing wrong with asking, but at some point, you need to switch over to thanking Him for what He\u2019s promised. The hand of God is lifting you, empowering you, reenergizing you. He\u2019s giving you special strength: strength to outlast, strength to try again, strength to step up to a new level.\n\nClick here to watch, \"Special Strength is Coming\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/8IdvBPYakY God doesn\u2019t expect you to be strong all the time. He understands there will be times that we get weary. The good news is He doesn\u2019t fault us for feeling weak. The scripture says, \u201cWhen you are weak, He is strong.\u201d God hasn\u2019t forgotten about you. He sees what you\u2019re going through. He sees the lonely nights, the struggles, all those times you\u2019ve gone the extra mile. He\u2019s about to increase your strength. Isaiah said, \u201cGod gives strength to the weary; He increases the power of the weak.\u201d You may be weary today, but the good news is strength is coming.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Special Strength is Coming\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/KDzVz3C8ty When you\u2019re down, when you\u2019re discouraged, God is not going to leave you there.

Don\u2019t be down on yourself because you\u2019re not strong all the time. You\u2019re human. God\u2019s not faulting you. He says, \u201cWhen you\u2019re weak, I\u2019m going to step in. I\u2019m going to make you strong.\" You may feel weak today, fatigued, but that is not your destiny.

That\u2019s why He said, \u201cI will give strength to the weary. I will increase the power of the weak.\u201d Whatever is trying to stop you is subject to change. It may look permanent, but it\u2019s only temporary. Don\u2019t be moved by what you see; be moved by what you know. The closed doors are as important as the open doors. The betrayals are just as important as the divine connections. God uses them all. The Creator of the Universe, the One who flung stars into space, is breathing in your direction. Him being for you is more than the world being against you. Don\u2019t panic over the pandemic; don\u2019t fear the unknown; don\u2019t lose sleep over what doesn\u2019t make sense.

It\u2019s easy to dismiss it and think it\u2019s nothing. But God can take a small cloud and bring a big blessing. He can take what looks insignificant and turn it into something amazing. Promotion doesn\u2019t come from people; it comes from the Lord. When God is ready to promote you, no person can stop you, no bad break, no disappointment, no delay.

I\u2019m glad that prayer didn\u2019t get answered. I\u2019m glad the delay happened.\" When you stay in faith when you don\u2019t understand, you\u2019re going to come into blessings that you don\u2019t understand. When you trust God when it doesn\u2019t make sense, you\u2019re going to come into favor that doesn\u2019t make sense. When it\u2019s the right time, when it all comes together, it\u2019s going to work for your good. You\u2019re going to see the hand of God.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Trusting When You Don't Understand\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/brVANho0VR Instead of using that energy trying to understand what\u2019s happening, use it to thank God that He\u2019s working. Thank Him that He\u2019s making your crooked places straight; thank Him that He\u2019s fighting your battles; thank Him that you\u2019re surrounded with His favor. If you believe God is ordering your steps, then you\u2019ll trust Him with the open doors and trust Him with the closed doors. You\u2019ll trust Him with the good breaks and trust Him with the bad breaks. Your steps are being ordered by the Lord. If He allowed it to happen, He\u2019s going to bring good out of it.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today! \"Trusting When You Don't Understand\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/gSzK2Ol3sn God never said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to understand everything. I\u2019m going to show you what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s all going to make sense.\u201d He said, \u201cMy ways are not your ways.\u201d He said, \u201cWalk by faith and not by sight.\u201d Sometimes we have short memories. We forget God is the one that opened the door. Don\u2019t forget about all the prayers God has answered. Storms come to us all; the good news is God is in control of the winds. He\u2019s in control of what\u2019s trying to stop you. All He has to do is shift the winds and instead of holding you back, they will thrust you forward. You can live from a place of peace, a place of rest, knowing that God is not only fighting your battles, but He\u2019s lined up the breaks you need. It may seem like the end, but really, it\u2019s a new beginning. You are stronger than you think. God is not going to leave you in that storm.\n\nCheck out \"You're Still Going to Get There\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/rxWIJpca6v Are you sitting on the sidelines, discouraged over what you lost, what you didn\u2019t get, what didn\u2019t work out? God says, \u201cIf you\u2019ll get your passion back, if you\u2019ll start believing again, you\u2019re still going to get there.\u201d The scripture says, \u201cGod\u2019s calling on our life is irrevocable.\u201d That means God doesn\u2019t change His mind. He knew every person that would do you wrong, every bad break. He took that all into account when He called you. Sometimes God will take things away that we think we need, so we\u2019ll have to depend on Him and not people.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"You're Still Going to Get There\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/3zgXpDMOvC God has been thinking about you long before you got here. The scripture says, God chose you before you could choose Him. You didn\u2019t get here on your own. If you could see what God has in mind, you would realize you couldn\u2019t handle it right now. You need more time to develop, to grow, to gain experience. The scripture says, \u201cLet patience have its perfect work.\u201d You have a purpose; you have an assignment. There is a calling on your life. You\u2019re not just filling up space; you\u2019re a person of destiny.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"You're Still Going to Get There\".

Stay encouraged. God knows how to make up for lost time. If you talk defeat, you\u2019re going to be defeated. If you think I\u2019ll never get out of this trouble, then you\u2019ll never get out. In the middle of the storm, you need to declare what God promised. Will you trust Him even though you don\u2019t see any sign of it improving? Will you stay in faith even though every thought says it\u2019s never going to work out?\n\nClick here to watch, \"You're Still Going to Get There\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/UYm41mLVGC Instead of depending on people\u2019s approval, why don\u2019t you go to God and get your approval from Him. Instead of relying on others to encourage you, start encouraging yourself. Start speaking favor, increase, healing, destiny over your life. The destiny in you is bigger than the storm around you. Your purpose cannot be stopped by the waves, by people, by the opposition. Stay in faith. Keep declaring what God said about you. When it\u2019s all said and done, what God promised will come to pass.\n\nListen now to this message from Joel, \"You're Still Going to Get There\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/ysppX57Dv4 You can\u2019t be moved by what you see; you have to be moved by what you know. Don\u2019t let circumstances talk you out of what God spoke to you. A storm cannot stop what God has purposed. You may be in a situation that doesn\u2019t look good, it would stop most people, but it can\u2019t stop you. You have a purpose; you have an assignment. There is a calling on your life, something God has ordained for you to accomplish. We think natural, but God is supernatural. He has ways we\u2019ve never thought of. He wouldn\u2019t have allowed that storm if it was going to keep you from your destiny.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s message today! \"You're Still Going to Get There\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/WwdYpMSH3A God doesn\u2019t promise something and then change His mind. He doesn\u2019t put a dream in your heart and then take it back. What He starts, He finishes. God already has the solution. He already has a way not just to bring you out, but He\u2019s going to make the enemy pay for bringing the trouble. He\u2019s going to bring you out better. When you help someone else shine, God is going to make sure that you shine. As you help others rise higher, God is going to help you rise higher. You\u2019re sowing a seed for where you want to go. If you could only see what God put in you, the courage, the strength, the determination, the fortitude, you would realize you can handle the challenges that come your way.

God is getting you ready to go higher, to see new levels of influence and favor. Don\u2019t complain about the difficult times; that\u2019s when you discover what\u2019s in you. If you\u2019ll keep the right attitude, instead of breaking you, the pressure will develop you. There are times that your breakthrough is tied to helping someone else get their breakthrough.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"The Secret to Solving Problems\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/RomGJpvu29 God didn\u2019t make you in His own image, breathe life into you, crown you with favor, so you could barely get by. He created you to soar, to set new standards, to take new ground, to go further than you\u2019ve imagined. When you know that God has you in the palm of His hand, you know nothing can snatch you away, you know the number of your days He will fulfill. When you make sacrifices to help other people's dreams come to pass, God will make sure your dream comes to pass.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"The Secret to Solving Problems\". Check it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/NbvUe5TtJB The scripture says, \u201cThe things we see are temporary, but the things we can\u2019t see are eternal.\u201d Don\u2019t get discouraged by what you see; it\u2019s not permanent. God has not forgotten about you. Those seeds you\u2019ve sown have not gone unnoticed. Keep being your best, being good to people, making sacrifices to help others, giving away what you needed for your dreams. Get ready for God to show out in your life. As you\u2019re helping others, you may not be able to see it, but God is helping you. He\u2019s lining up the promotion, the breakthroughs, the healing. \n\nClick here to watch, \"The Secret to Solving Problems\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/5gVJexJgb9 Every time you help solve someone\u2019s problem, every time you make sacrifices to help them go further, you\u2019re sowing a seed, not only for you to go further but for those that come after you in your family line to go further. When you live a life of generosity, making sacrifices for others to come up higher, that\u2019s not only going to impact you for good, it\u2019s going to impact your children, your grandchildren. Those seeds are going to keep on producing. You can\u2019t be good to others without God being good back to you. There are blessings connected to helping others.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"The Secret to Solving Problems\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/QY6404W96x Here\u2019s the beauty of helping others: what you give is going to come back to you. When you make sacrifices to help other people\u2019s dreams come to pass, God will help make your dream come to pass. When you give your time, your energy, your resources, your talent, you will never end up with less. That is a seed you\u2019re sowing that\u2019s going to keep coming back to you.

When you show favor, favor will come to you.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today! \"The Secret to Solving Problems\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/pRmeZm8WXM When you\u2019re in difficult times, more than ever, you need to look for opportunities to do good. When your dream seems impossible, find somebody that you can help make their dream come to pass. Don\u2019t get tired of doing what\u2019s right. If you\u2019ll keep passing the test, the scripture says your due season is coming. God is not only going to bring you out, but He\u2019s going to make up for the time it looks like you\u2019re losing. You can do the right thing at the wrong time and miss your destiny. Timing is critical. When God says do something, you need to do it. It may not make sense now, but God knows things you don\u2019t know. When you get in agreement with God, then you will become what He says about you. You will have what He says you have. It\u2019s a window of grace; it won\u2019t last forever. You can\u2019t put it off and expect it to be there in a year. When you feel it, you have to take advantage of it. Stir your faith up. \n\nCheck out \"Windows of Grace\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/tqywwlVX5G When you look back over your life, you\u2019ll see the faithfulness of God: where He promoted you, protected you, healed you, favored you. Don\u2019t take it for granted. It didn\u2019t happen by accident; it wasn\u2019t a lucky break. That\u2019s the goodness of God. The scripture says, \u201cDon\u2019t despise the day of small beginnings.\u201d Don\u2019t get discouraged because where you are is much smaller than what is in your spirit. You have to be faithful with the small before God will trust you with more. That\u2019s a time of testing, a time of proving. You don\u2019t know how long that window is going to be open. Don\u2019t keep making excuses. This is an opportunity to come up higher, to see God\u2019s favor in greater ways.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Windows of Grace\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/s5ARqLjWSg When something doesn\u2019t work out, it\u2019s because God has something better in store. You may not be able to see it at the time, but that\u2019s when you have to trust Him. You\u2019re never wasting time serving others. It\u2019s a part of God\u2019s plan. You can\u2019t reach your destiny without that time of being faithful to another person\u2019s dream. That\u2019s showing God that He can trust you with your own. Start believing you\u2019re well able, start praying bold prayers, start declaring victory over your life. Be bold; be strong. The Lord your God is with you.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"Windows of Grace\". Check it out here: https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/zr0kf3HrOZ God puts things in your spirit as a seed. If you discount it, say no way that could never happen, then that seed will never take root. You don\u2019t have to figure out how it\u2019s going to happen. All you have to do is believe. An incredible door is opening, an opportunity of a lifetime, and with that moment comes the favor to accomplish, the power to overcome, the strength to defeat the opposition. If there\u2019s no risk, then it doesn\u2019t take faith. If there\u2019s no chance you can fail, then you don\u2019t need God\u2019s help.\n\nClick here to watch, \"Windows of Grace\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/zFUuuVwtNE You wouldn\u2019t be reading this if God wasn\u2019t about to open a window of opportunity. When it comes, step into it: pursue that dream, stretch your faith, make the changes that you need to make. Don\u2019t let it pass you by. Don't put off what you know God is telling you to do. When you feel that urging, that knowing, if you keep delaying, the window of grace is going to close. The scripture says, \u201cToday, if you hear His voice, hearken to what He says.\u201d He\u2019s opening a window of grace. That\u2019s the time to obey. Not tomorrow, not next week, but right then.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Windows of Grace\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/8HLXfKFt0V The longer you wait, the less passion you\u2019re going to feel, the less likely you\u2019ll be to do it. Don\u2019t put it off; it\u2019s an opportune moment. It\u2019s not months or years; it\u2019s a window of time, a passing opportunity. Don\u2019t take grace for granted. That\u2019s a destiny moment, where God is making a way, where you can come up higher. When you feel that faith, you have to step into it. That\u2019s God saying, \u201cThis is your time. This is your season.\u201d God never asks us to do something, and then not give us the ability to do it. You\u2019ll have the favor, the determination, the strength to do what you couldn\u2019t do before.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today! \"Windows of Grace\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/RAWORxsIYi There is grace for a season to accomplish what God put in your heart.

God is about to break those yokes that have pulled you down so you can step up to who you were created to be. The final word is freedom, wholeness, abundance, victory.

When God does it, it will be better than you could have done it. Don\u2019t be discouraged by who\u2019s not for you. You don\u2019t need them. You and God are a majority.

When you say, \u201cI\u2019ll never get out of this problem,\u201d it\u2019s going to keep you there. Instead of agreeing with the enemy, start declaring what God says about you. Don\u2019t expect everyone to cheer you on. God has put greatness in you.

The valleys are strategic. When you\u2019re on top of a mountain, the only way to go higher is to come down that mountain, go through the valley, and go up a bigger mountain. The valley is not your home. The valley is temporary; you\u2019re just passing through. The addiction, the loneliness, the anxiety is not going to hinder you your whole life. You were created to be free, to be joyful, to live an abundant, fulfilled life. God allows valleys, not to hold us back, but because He\u2019s taking us higher. Have a new perspective. That valley is not there to stop you; it\u2019s there to promote you.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today! \"From Valley to Victory\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/vZFYILUNIz You may be in a valley of trouble, a valley of loneliness, a valley of debt.

It\u2019s time to say goodbye to guilt. It\u2019s not over until God says it\u2019s over. Go back and look again. Your story doesn\u2019t end in defeat; it ends in victory. There are new levels, new giants to conquer, new mountains to climb, new skills to learn. Don\u2019t let it overwhelm you; let it inspire you. Are you putting yourself down, talking about how you don\u2019t measure up, what you can\u2019t do, how you\u2019ll never be free?

What God started, He\u2019s going to finish. He has the final say. You have an advantage. The Creator of the Universe not only breathed life into you, but He put a hedge of protection around you. Nothing can touch you without His permission. You\u2019re not at the mercy of bad breaks, people that are against you. None of that can stop your destiny.

You have seeds of greatness. You\u2019re full of talent, creativity. You were created to be free, to be happy, to accomplish your dreams. Not to get by in life, but to excel, to leave your mark on this generation. Whatever has you bound, whatever is restricting you, God is saying this is your time to be free. It is not your destiny to go through life with something limiting you. If you\u2019ll let this take root, I believe every chain that\u2019s holding you back is being broken. If Jesus were here today, He would look at you and say, \u201cShould not this son, should not this daughter of the Most High God be free from that sickness, from that addiction, from that limitation?\u201d\n\nListen now to, \"The Chain Breaker\": https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/tw3uP0pVAu God will show up when you least expect it: when the odds seem more against you than ever, when the obstacle looks too big.

Those things that have held you back for years, you\u2019re not going to see them anymore. This is a new day of freedom, a new day of wholeness, a new day of increase. Most of us know God as a savior, we know Him as a healer, we know Him as a provider, but we also need to know Him as a chain breaker.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s new message today! \"The Chain Breaker\"  https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/SLDXvNzJ21 You were not created to be bound by loneliness, bound by shame, bound by negative words spoken over you. The good news is our God is a chain breaker. You may not see how it could happen, your situation looks permanent, but this is a new day. Don\u2019t believe those lies that the darkness is permanent and it\u2019s never going to change. That darkness is a sign that double is coming. The sun is going to rise in your life again. You\u2019re going to see the goodness of God in ways you\u2019ve never seen. When people see you set a new standard, go places you never dreamed, they won\u2019t be able to deny the hand of God on your life. That dark time is not wasted; God is using it to birth something that you could have never experienced without it.\n\nCheck out \"Victory Begins in the Dark\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/KpspxxmnN3 https://t.co/qD4cmNTz24 When you believe what you\u2019ve heard and don\u2019t let people talk you out of it, taking steps of faith, God will make things happen that you couldn\u2019t make happen. He\u2019ll open doors that no person can shut. Sometimes we don\u2019t serve because it seems small, insignificant. But on the way to the big things God has in store, He will test us with small things. There may be dark seasons, but if you\u2019ll stay in faith, God won\u2019t just bring you out, He\u2019ll bring you out better than you were before.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Victory Begins in the Dark\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/vaUyi2TLIU God has something amazing in front of you: amazing people, opportunities, influence, resources.

Keep moving forward when you don\u2019t understand; keep being your best when it\u2019s not fair. God promises to take what was meant for harm and turn it for your good.

Keep being good to people that are not good to you. Keep a smile; keep a song of praise. That\u2019s not just being positive; that\u2019s an attitude of faith. That\u2019s what allows God to show out in your life.

That sickness didn\u2019t come to stay; it came to pass. It\u2019s got to go back. God didn\u2019t create you to go through life overcome by problems, burdened down.

But here\u2019s the key, the shaking is not there to stop you; the shaking is there to shift you.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s message today! \"The Shaking is for Shifting\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/AdLuSNK8Qr Anyone can trust God when things are going their way, life is good, you\u2019re seeing favor. The real test is will you trust Him when things are shaking? Will you stay in faith when there\u2019s uncertainty, things you don\u2019t understand? When God speaks, His words are so powerful that things happen where there is no explanation. God is supernatural. He said you will live and not die. He has the final say. Medically speaking, it can\u2019t be explained. The only explanation is we serve a God who is all-powerful. Don\u2019t have a small vision. Don\u2019t go around thinking you\u2019ve reached your limits. God is about to do a new thing, something that you haven\u2019t seen. He\u2019s going to open doors you never dreamed would open, take you places that you can\u2019t go on your own. We don\u2019t know what people are going through. Your words can be what keeps them moving forward. God puts people in our path on purpose so we can bring healing. Letting people know that you care does more than you imagine. What the enemy sent to stop you is not going to have its intended purpose. Keep thanking God that He\u2019s fighting your battles, that what was meant for harm, He\u2019s turning to your advantage.\n\nCheck out \"You Have the Cure\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/EZjeGZ8rHm When you\u2019re in difficult times, don\u2019t sit around. Do something where God can see your faith. Make plans to get well, make plans to come out of that trouble, make plans for God to show out in your life. The scripture says, \u201cEvery good gift comes from our Father in heaven above.\u201d That good gift may come through people, but it came from God. Your salary may come through your company, but it came from your Heavenly Father. Don\u2019t go through life looking down, thinking, \u201cThis problem is too big; it\u2019s never going to work out.\u201d Get a new perspective. The forces that are for you are greater than the forces that are against you.\n\nDon't miss, \"You Have the Cure\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/Lpr9eD2dVm Faith is not always going to make sense; what God says is not always going to be logical. If you reason it out and check with all the experts and study all the reports, you\u2019ll miss God\u2019s best. You may be surrounded by trouble, surrounded by debt, surrounded by addiction, but what you can\u2019t see is the Most High God is surrounding what\u2019s surrounding you. You can\u2019t see it, but God is working behind the scenes. He\u2019s making things happen that you couldn\u2019t make happen.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"You Have the Cure\".

The scripture says the spirit of faith is in our words. Why do you think the enemy\u2019s trying to stop you? He doesn\u2019t bother people that are not a threat. He wouldn\u2019t waste his time on you if he didn\u2019t know you were a world changer, a history maker, that you have seeds of greatness. Don\u2019t be surprised if you get a few snake bites: a friend walks away, the company doesn\u2019t need you anymore. Take the anti-venom. \u201cGod, I know You\u2019re still on the throne. I know no weapon formed against me will prosper.\u201d\n\nCheck out, \"You Have the Cure\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/nHi92t89BX When you go through loss and things knock the wind out of you, it\u2019s tempting to give up on life, think that you\u2019ve seen your best days. You have to say, \u201cFather, thank You that You have beauty for these ashes. Thank You that there are good days up ahead.\u201d We\u2019re not at the mercy of fear, depression, addictions. We have the cure. The Most High God is breathing in our direction. Him being for you is more than the world being against you. RT @lakewoodchurch: We are all blessed to be a blessing. Be inspired by Alex Bregman @ABREG_1 and Reagan Howard and their effort to raise f\u2026 The enemy will try to poison you with doubt, poison you with fear, poison you with insecurity. That poison cannot keep you from your destiny.\n\nListen now to this message from Joel, \"You Have the Cure\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/Y3GrUkGaTE You can\u2019t reach your destiny if you\u2019re always looking back. Nothing you\u2019ve done is a surprise to God. He knew every mistake you would make, every failure. You can still get to where you\u2019re supposed to be, but you have to shake off the guilt and move ahead. God is saying, \u201cLook up.\u201d  There\u2019s healing when you look up. There\u2019s freedom when you look up. There\u2019s victory when you look up. There\u2019s salvation when you look up. Proverbs says, \"God\u2019s word is like medicine.\" When you meditate on it, it brings healing and wholeness.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s message this morning! \"You Have the Cure\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/Jky3vwmyDl When you\u2019re dealing with fear, depression, anxiety, don\u2019t just accept it and think, \u201cI\u2019ll always struggle in this area.\u201d Take your medicine. \u201cFather, thank You that I am free, I have the mind of Christ, I have peace that surpasses understanding.\u201d Sometimes God will let you get into a situation where there is no possible way out so that when He turns it around, everyone will know it was Him. Whatever God put in your heart, go after it. Quit looking at how impossible it is, how long it\u2019s been, what you don\u2019t have. Shake off the disappointments, what didn\u2019t work out, who left you. You have greatness in you. God said He will never let you face anything that you can\u2019t handle. He will always give you the grace, the strength, the faith, for what comes your way. Who told you that you\u2019re not qualified? Who told you that you\u2019ve made too many mistakes, you\u2019ll never be successful? Those are the wrong voices. Tune that out and get in tune with God.\n\nCheck out \"Power Thinking\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/upH4C0eG5p God doesn\u2019t have to prove anything. He\u2019s God, whether we believe it or not. But sometimes, He\u2019ll prove to people that you\u2019re His child when you\u2019re in difficult situations where you\u2019re outnumbered, when the giants are too big, when the addiction seems permanent. The critics, the naysayers, are a dime a dozen. Eighty percent will tell you what you can\u2019t do. You have to find the twenty percent that will tell you what you can do. The majority won\u2019t encourage you; they won\u2019t see what you see. You have to find the minority. At the start of the day, you need to set your mind for victory. Don\u2019t let just any thoughts play. You have to think on purpose. Get your mind going in the right direction.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Power Thinking\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/C5Gi9Ar4hf You may not like it, it may be uncomfortable, but stay in faith. They meant it to harm you, but God is going to use it to promote you. When He pays you back, you\u2019re not going to come out the same. Don\u2019t go through life thinking you can\u2019t reach your dreams, you can\u2019t overcome that obstacle, you\u2019ll never meet the right person. You have the key. Your Heavenly Father has given you everything you need to fulfill your purpose. You don\u2019t have to fear the virus, fear what the economy is going to do, fear the future.  Keep honoring God and He will keep you safe.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"Power Thinking\". Check it out here: https://t.co/spV2a4pL3j https://t.co/VN8ict5nbC God likes to do things far and beyond what we could ever accomplish on our own. If you can reach your dreams in your own talent, your own strength, your own effort, then you don\u2019t need God. Where are the people that believe God will display His awesome power through them? It\u2019s good to read about His power, it\u2019s good to talk about it, good to remember it, but God wants you to experience it. Look at how big your God is. He parted Red Seas; He closed the mouths of lions; He brought the dead back to life. That obstacle is no match for Him.\n\nClick here to watch, \"Power Thinking\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/b6aBTmKdCu It may be tough now, but keep the right perspective. Victory is in your future; healing is in your future. Abundance, freedom, breakthroughs are in your future. The giants may be big, but our God is bigger. The enemy knows if he can keep you defeated in your thoughts, then he\u2019ll keep you defeated in your life. The battle is taking place in our minds. Proverbs 4 says, \u201cBe careful what you think because your thoughts run your life.\u201d Are your thoughts helping you or hurting you?  Start thinking power thoughts, victory thoughts.\n\nListen now to this message from Joel, \"Power Thinking\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/3H5WFVNcf2 Pay attention to what you\u2019re dwelling on. Don\u2019t just think of anything that comes to mind. If it\u2019s negative, discouraging, fearful, don\u2019t give it the time of day. Turn it around and dwell on what God says about you. The way to get in tune with God is to think what He says about you, not what you feel, not what it looks like, not what the experts say, not what the economy says, but what the Most High God has spoken over you. Victory starts in our minds. Success, breakthroughs, new levels depend on our thinking.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s message here! \"Power Thinking\" https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/S4j1GbNStd We draw in what we constantly think about. You can\u2019t think defeat and have victory. You can\u2019t think weak and have strength. You can\u2019t think you're not able and accomplish your dreams. Your life is going to follow your thoughts. We don\u2019t realize the power of our words, the power of a simple compliment, the power of, \u201cI believe in you. You\u2019re going to make it.\u201d Your words may seem ordinary to you, but when God breathes life into them, they become extraordinary to the other person. Will you stay in faith when God is silent? Will you wait with a good attitude, thanking God that He has the final say when nothing is changing?  How you wait will determine whether or not your situation changes. Maybe you\u2019re standing on a promise and it hasn\u2019t come to pass yet. Don\u2019t worry; your time is coming. Stay in faith. Keep reminding Him what He promised. Keep bringing it to remembrance, thanking Him that it\u2019s on the way. You\u2019re going to see God show out in your life. The final word says your latter days will be better than your former days. The final word says what God started in your life He will finish.\n\nCheck out \"God Has the Final Say\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/S6Y285liq1 It\u2019s not over until God says it\u2019s over. Go back and look again. Your story doesn\u2019t end in defeat; it ends in victory. Get your passion back and start believing again. Put God in remembrance of what He promised, not what you feel like, not what a relative said, but what God said. Psalm 86 says, \u201cGod is full of kindness, and great in mercy. The Lord is good to all.\u201d God is about to break those yokes that have pulled you down so you can step up to who you were created to be. The final word is freedom, wholeness, abundance, victory.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"God Has the Final Say\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/URwVPjuUgj God wants to help you. He wants to heal you, to free you, to increase you, to take you places that you\u2019ve never dreamed. He\u2019s longing to be good to you. Look to Him as your Source. When we come to the end of what we can do that\u2019s where God steps in. If you can accomplish your dreams on your own, you don\u2019t need God. If you can get out of the problem by yourself, it doesn\u2019t take much faith. When we face difficulties, one of the best things we can do is find a promise in the scripture and remind God what He said. Don\u2019t dwell on what seems impossible. Are you spending more time thinking about the problem or the promise? Are you talking more about how big the challenge is or about how big your God is? God is on the throne. Him being for you is more than the world being against you. God won\u2019t allow you to get into a problem that He can\u2019t get you out of.\n\nClick here to watch, \"God Has the Final Say\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/rjVxXE7uxs Too often we\u2019re striving to make things happen, discouraged because it\u2019s taking too long, trying to beat down doors. God is saying, \u201cCome to Me. Ask Me for help. Call on My name and acknowledge Me as your Source.\u201d We may not understand it, but you can rest assured that God has the final say. He planned your days before you were born, and He promised that He will fulfill the number of your days. God hasn\u2019t forgotten about you. What He promised is still on the way. What God started He\u2019s going to finish. He has the final say.\n\nListen now to this message from Joel, \"God Has the Final Say\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/aSAuDvh2dL Take the problem off the throne and put God back on the throne. God is sovereign over your circumstances. That means God reigns over everything in your life. Not just the universe, but He reigns over the sickness, over your children, over your finances. You think it\u2019s been too long; it didn\u2019t happen in time. So you put the stone over the promise, put the stone over the dream. But you have to do your part and roll that stone away. Start believing again. Get your passion back. You have an advantage. The Creator of the universe not only breathed life into you, but He put a hedge of protection around you. Nothing can touch you without His permission.\n\nTune into Joel\u2019s message this morning! \"God Has the Final Say\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/zIKTbmlcc6 They crucified Jesus and put Him in the grave. They thought He was done, but on the third day, He rose up and said, \u201cI am alive forevermore.\u201d God has the final say. He\u2019s already planned out your days for good. https://t.co/hVdnjViL5U We can live with the confidence that all of our sins\u2014past, present, and future\u2014have not just been covered, not just been atoned for, but they have been washed away. We have an everlasting release. Jesus is the rock from which the water of life flows out: salvation, healing, freedom, abundance.  We don\u2019t have to work for our salvation, try to be good enough, earn God\u2019s love, earn forgiveness. This new covenant is not based on works; it\u2019s based on grace. You can stay in peace, knowing that the God who created the universe is the guardian of your soul.\n\nCheck out \"The Guardian of Your Soul\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/mJiDN5ZC1w God is fighting for you. https://t.co/2Incf2xkLS The scripture says, God has already accepted you, He\u2019s already blotted out your sins, He\u2019s already shed His blood. It\u2019s not if He\u2019s going to do it; He\u2019s already done it. The question is will you receive it? You don\u2019t know what God is up to. You\u2019re looking at it in the natural, but we serve a supernatural God. Get in agreement with Him. Believe that something good is on the way. Start declaring, \u201cLord, thank You that You\u2019re my protector.

They\u2019re still alive. There will always be forces trying to convince us to settle where we are, but you have to stir your faith up. God didn\u2019t bring you this far to leave you. What He started in your life, He\u2019s going to finish. You may not see how it can happen, but He has a way. Your body is a temple of the Most High God.

He wants to show out in a new way. Get around dreamers; connect with people that are more talented, more successful, more experienced. Learn from them. That\u2019s good soil. Just because you don\u2019t see anything happening, doesn\u2019t mean God is not working. https://t.co/2s2O7G4aIQ There is a God watching over you that will rescue you from trouble.

If you constantly take in the negative, you\u2019re going to sink. Tune it out and tune into what God says about you. Don\u2019t let what\u2019s on the outside get on the inside.

Come back to a place of peace. Yes, there\u2019s uncertainty. We don\u2019t know what the future holds, but we do know Who holds the future. God is still on the throne. This is not the time to live worried, afraid. The God who breathed life into you is watching over you. He\u2019s pushing back the opposition. He\u2019s ordering your steps, putting you at the right place at the right time. Let this phrase sink down in your spirit, \"It shall be well with you.\"  God is your provider.

God bless you and the team. Keep the right perspective: the suffering is not permanent. That suffering is not going to last. It didn\u2019t come to stay; it came to pass. Start believing again; start dreaming again. Start talking like it\u2019s going to happen; start acting like it\u2019s going to happen. Start thanking God that it\u2019s on the way. When you\u2019re in tough times, you need to remind yourself that is not how your story ends. Greater is coming: greater joy, greater strength, greater relationships.\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s new message this morning! \"Greater is Coming\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/2VuYVvY4ii We all have unfair things happen. Some things we\u2019re not going to understand. Don\u2019t spend your life trying to answer all the why\u2019s of life; that\u2019s going to frustrate you. God knows how to work all things for your good. If you can\u2019t celebrate people that are further along than you, then you\u2019ll never get to where they are. Be happy for them. We think natural, but God is supernatural. He\u2019s not limited by what limits us. He controls the universe. Don\u2019t let your natural logic talk you out of what a supernatural God can do. RT @lakewoodchurch: Invite your friends and family to meet us ONLINE this weekend! Let\u2019s share the message of hope to the world!\n\nLakewood\u2026 Your race has been designed specifically for you. You\u2019re not in competition with your friends, your neighbors, your siblings, your coworkers. The only competition you have is with yourself, to be the best that you can be. God is your protector, your deliverer, your way maker, your provider, your healer.\n\nCheck out \"Invite God Into Your Difficulties\" on podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/OWb1rej3SD Are you recognizing the Source? Are you thanking God for every good thing? The more you acknowledge God\u2019s goodness, the more of His goodness you will see. When you honor God, you are connected to a supply line that will never run dry. You\u2019re not at the mercy of the economy or who likes you or what your boss does. God has all kinds of resources He can use. Without a great test, you won\u2019t have a great testimony. Without big battles, you won\u2019t have big victories.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Invite God Into Your Difficulties\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXoPj9 https://t.co/oXeRTzj6xf Take a break from telling God everything that\u2019s wrong. He already knows your needs. There\u2019s nothing wrong with asking, but at some point, you need to switch over to thanking Him for what He\u2019s promised. Don\u2019t just pray the problems; pray the promises. If you only tell God what\u2019s wrong, then you\u2019re limiting what He can do. Follow up the problem with a promise. When He\u2019s with you, you can\u2019t be defeated. You and God are a majority. He\u2019s a supernatural God.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"Invite God Into Your Difficulties\". Check it out here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/JdrdNHpjl7 The right attitude is, \u201cGod, I believe You\u2019re going to bring me out, but in the meantime, I\u2019m asking You to come into this struggle in my health, come into this loss that I\u2019m going through, come into this depression that\u2019s trying to stop me.\u201d God doesn\u2019t stop every negative situation; He uses these adversities to move us closer to Him.\n\nClick here to watch, \"Invite God Into Your Difficulties\": https://t.co/kMfAhXoPj9 https://t.co/LJVaRx76qO You don\u2019t have to do this in your own strength. You don\u2019t have to figure it all out. You\u2019re not going to know all the details. You have to walk by faith and not by sight. We wouldn\u2019t know His power if we were never thrown into a fire. We wouldn\u2019t know He was a healer if we never faced an illness. We wouldn\u2019t know He could move mountains if we never faced a big obstacle. God is working in the trouble. He\u2019s working in that situation that\u2019s difficult.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Invite God Into Your Difficulties\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/YwIvdO7dpb The Psalmist says, \u201cGod is a very present help in times of trouble.\u201d We know God is always with us, but when you\u2019re in difficulties, if you\u2019ll invite Him in, you\u2019ll feel His presence in a greater way. What\u2019s more powerful than God bringing you out of that difficulty is when God comes in and begins to change things. He comes in and gives you favor despite who\u2019s trying to push you down, strength that you can\u2019t explain, grace to outlast what should stop you. RT @VictoriaOsteen: The Bible says to be anxious for nothing, but in everything pray. Let\u2019s join our faith in agreement.\n\n#NationalDayOfPra\u2026 The God who controls the fire, the God who speaks to storms, the God who restores, who heals, who pays you back for the injustice, is watching over you, protecting you, ordering your steps. Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re not getting credit. Don\u2019t get discouraged if people don\u2019t thank you. God sees your sacrifice. When you give, He gives you more back. When you show someone favor, He shows you more favor. Victoria and I want you to know we are praying for you and God\u2019s got you in the palm of His hand. I have learned a place of peace is a place of power. https://t.co/DOOSef7BO4 The scripture says, \u201cNo man can take your joy.\u201d That means you control your joy.

There will be new beginnings, times where God pays you back. Don\u2019t get stuck. God wouldn\u2019t have allowed it if it wasn\u2019t going to move you toward your destiny. Pass the test.

When you\u2019re tempted to get upset, remind yourself, you have the power to remain calm. Keep it in perspective; this day is a gift. Honor God by living it grateful, happy, and to the fullest.

You can\u2019t control what people do, what they say, but you can control how you respond. Don\u2019t give away your joy. Your job is to run your race, to be who God has called you to be and not worry about the critics and the naysayers.\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s message this morning! \"Keep Your Joy\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/8Az8Vp8oHC Don\u2019t let the small things keep you from seeing the gift of this day. Keep it in perspective. It\u2019s not worth losing your joy over. You have health, you have life, you have freedom, you have opportunity. Too often, we\u2019re discouraged over what God has ordained. But there are times God will take you backward before He thrusts you forward. The cutback is a test. There will never be another you. Let your gifts shine. Show your personality, your talent, your style. We don\u2019t need an imitation. We don\u2019t need a copy. We need the original you. Some things you have to endure. The way to do that is to know that it\u2019s not permanent; you\u2019re going to come out better. When you come to the end of life, you\u2019re not going to give an account to people of what you did with your time, your talents, your resources.

You can\u2019t be a people pleaser and reach your potential. People will try to squeeze you into what they\u2019re used to, into what they think. Take advice, listen to counsel, but you may have to disappoint a few people to reach your destiny.

You have the blessing. God\u2019s face is smiling on you. We all want to rise higher, accomplish dreams, overcome obstacles, but as long as we\u2019re only focused on ourselves, we\u2019ll get stuck.

There is greatness in you, there are dreams in you, there are new levels, all they need is to be stirred up. That fire may be a little flicker, but it\u2019s still in you.

What He started, He\u2019s going to finish. Now you have to do your part and stir it up. Don\u2019t judge your future by where you are right now.

God doesn\u2019t just want to do the ordinary, the common. He has some uncommon blessings, unusual increase, unprecedented favor. His dream for your life is much bigger than your own. The winds, the storms, the challenges, have done all they could to stop you, but you\u2019re still standing. Things are about to change in your favor; negative situations are about to turn around.

Show God He can trust you, that you\u2019ll go the extra mile to do the right thing. You\u2019re not doing life alone. In the unseen world right now, you have powerful angels surrounding you.

He\u2019s looking for the real you. Be real. That\u2019s the kind of people God promotes. There\u2019s power in vulnerability. Maybe you\u2019re facing an illness, you\u2019re raising a difficult child, you\u2019re in a tough time at work. That is not going to defeat you.

I\u2019m still going to heal you. I\u2019m still going to bring that dream to pass.\u201d Nothing you\u2019ve done is a surprise to God. Nothing that\u2019s happened to you has caught Him off guard. He has mercy for every mistake, restoration for every failure, new beginnings for every loss, a comeback for every setback. What He promised you is still on the way. We\u2019re so excited to be coming back to New York City for our Night of Hope at Yankee Stadium!\n\nThis year we have special guests: Kanye and the Sunday Service Choir!

Stay encouraged; you\u2019re on the verge of overflow. In the difficult times, God has promised that you\u2019re going to overflow with abundance. You\u2019re not going to lack anything you need. There\u2019s going to be plenty of strength, plenty of healing, plenty of peace, plenty of grace. The scripture says, \u201cWhen you honor God, blessings will chase you down.\u201d You don\u2019t have to look for the blessings; keep God first place, and the blessings will look for you.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Get Ready for Overflow\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/uiMdsqv5zk You don\u2019t need everyone to be for you; you just need the right people to be for you. God has already ordained divine connections that will help you fulfill your purpose. God is saying, \u201cThrow that net out one more time.\u201d Start believing again, start dreaming again, start taking steps of faith. You don\u2019t know what God is about to do. The reason it hasn\u2019t happened yet is that it\u2019s bigger than you think. God is about to put you in the right place at the right time. He\u2019s going to make things happen that you didn\u2019t see coming.\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s new message this morning! \"Get Ready for Overflow\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/gjfaFgCIbM All the circumstances may say it\u2019s impossible, but God is asking you, \u201cWhen did I become weak? Is there any limit to My power?\u201d Get in agreement with God. He\u2019s about to shift some things in your favor. There is a fight for your future, but God is fighting for you. The enemy may send the storm, opposition that looks too big, but don\u2019t worry; God controls the winds. He overrides every negative force. When you\u2019re faithful in the silent seasons, when you do the right thing when you don\u2019t understand it, you are passing the test. You are setting yourself up for God to take you further than you ever dreamed. When the odds are against you and you don\u2019t see how it could work out, don\u2019t get discouraged. Remind yourself tomorrow will be better than today. That\u2019s not just being positive; that\u2019s what the scripture says. \u201cThe path of the righteous gets brighter and brighter.\u201d Just because you don\u2019t see anything happening on the outside that doesn\u2019t mean something is not happening on the inside. You have to walk by faith and not by sight. You have to recognize God is doing a new thing. You\u2019re growing; you\u2019re coming up higher. That discomfort is a sign you\u2019re going to a new level. If you keep doing the right thing, you'll come into a time where God causes you to be seen. Promotion doesn\u2019t come from people; it comes from the Lord. \n\nCheck out \"Seasons of Silence\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/6OGROTxEYa Tickets for An Evening with Joel &amp; Victoria at Yankee Stadium, featuring Kanye West and The Sunday Service Choir are on sale now!\n\nFor more info, click here: https://t.co/VN57icrAqt https://t.co/hPDnkEboKg We won\u2019t see new levels without going through seasons of losing things.

He can see things you can\u2019t see. He knows what\u2019s best. It\u2019s all a part of His plan to get you prepared, developed, stronger. God knows what you\u2019re going to need. The truth is it\u2019s a season of silence, not a lifetime of silence. What God has spoken over you has an appointed time to come to pass. Don\u2019t get discouraged. The silence is temporary. Don\u2019t compare your life to other people. Run your race. God\u2019s purpose for your life is not the same as theirs. Stay focused on your calling. Check out \"Seasons of Silence\" from Joel: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/SRbzLNZ4xZ Do the right thing when it\u2019s hard. Keep a good attitude when people are not treating you right. Go the extra mile when nobody is watching. You may not see anything happening on the outside but, on the inside, God is preparing you to go to new levels. God has not forgotten about you. He knows how long it\u2019s been. He knows what\u2019s in you: the gifts, the talents, the dreams. He put them there. Instead of fighting the silence, embrace it. Before you see notoriety, you\u2019ll go through a season of obscurity. You have to pass the test when you\u2019re being hidden.\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s message this morning! \"Seasons of Silence\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/oFJGDJ1wL5 God will be involved in your life as much as you want Him to be. If you keep Him in a Sunday morning box, He\u2019ll stay there. But He wants to be so much more than that. There are promises you may have given up on, but God hasn\u2019t given up. They\u2019re still in your future. Don\u2019t go around down on yourself, thinking you\u2019ve seen your best days; stir your faith up. The Lord God Almighty is at work in your life right now. You have to answer back the doubt with faith. All through the day, \u201cLord, thank You that it\u2019s going happen quickly, thank You that these enemies are hurrying out of my way, thank You that I\u2019m going to see a rapid turnaround.\u201d God can take a mistake and turn it into a miracle. When we don\u2019t deserve it\u2014we made mistakes, we got in a hurry\u2014God says, \u201cI\u2019m still going to bless you. I\u2019m still going to give you favor. I\u2019m still going to get you to where you\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d Take time to acknowledge the goodness of God in your life. Not only are you thanking God, you\u2019re reminding yourself that you didn\u2019t get here alone. God brings these favor connections across our path.

The circumstances may look impossible, but God hasn\u2019t run out of options. You may not see a way, but that\u2019s because we\u2019re natural. God is supernatural. He has ways you\u2019ve never thought of. You may be surrounded by trouble, surrounded by debt, surrounded by an addiction, but what you can\u2019t see is the Most High God is surrounding what\u2019s surrounding you. It may look like you\u2019re falling behind, the opposition is holding you back. No, stay encouraged; at the right time, that adversity is going to hurry out of your way.\n\nCheck out; \"It's Going to Happen Quickly\"  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/DBUKxkqG8l There\u2019s a price to pay to become all you were created to be.

He\u2019s not intimidated by how big the opposition is, by how bad the medical report looks, by what the financial statement says. God is about to do a quick work. Lack, struggle, debt is about to hurry out of your way.

Do you leave motivated, challenged, or are you discouraged, drained? Not every friend will inspire you, but you should have one or two that light a fire on the inside, that push you forward. The One that matters has His eyes on you. The One that controls the universe, the One that turns people\u2019s hearts, He\u2019s watching over you, He\u2019s working out His plan for your life.

Be aware of who\u2019s in your life. Take time to let people know that you care. Your words can be what keeps them moving forward. It looks like it\u2019s going to take a long time to get well, to break the addiction, to meet the right person. No, get ready. It\u2019s going to happen quickly. It\u2019s going to be unusual, out of the ordinary. You\u2019re going to know it\u2019s the hand of God. You may not like it, it may be uncomfortable, but stay in faith. They meant it to harm you, but God is going to use it to promote you. When He pays you back, you\u2019re not going to come out the same. We\u2019re all so busy these days. We all have our own challenges. If we\u2019re not careful, we\u2019ll pass by people in need. Let them know that you care.

A blessing is not a blessing until it\u2019s spoken. God loves you too much to let you miss your destiny. He has new levels in store for you, new opportunities, new relationships. Will you trust Him in the cutback seasons? You weren\u2019t created to go through life defeated, condemned, guilty.

The way to honor God is not by being down on yourself, living guilty, unworthy; it\u2019s by receiving His mercy. You\u2019re not worthy because of what you did or didn\u2019t do; you\u2019re worthy because of what Jesus did.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"When God Doesn't Listen\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/jImkfE7wOd \"Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that.

Don\u2019t let the accuser deceive you into going through life with no passion, thinking you\u2019ve blown it too many times. Your record has been cleared. When the Lord God Almighty shows up, what\u2019s impossible becomes possible. What He\u2019s destined for your life will come to pass. The promise is not that you won\u2019t have difficulties; the promise is God will bring you out, not of some of them, not of most of them, but out of all of them. Keep thanking God that it\u2019s coming; keep believing when it\u2019s not improving. Don\u2019t be moved by what\u2019s not changing; walk by faith and not by sight.

Things are about to turn in your favor. What you thought was going to stop you, instead, it's going to promote you. When you honor God with your life, there is a blessing He puts on you that gives you an advantage. You won\u2019t have room to receive all the good things God has in store.

He\u2019s bigger than your opposition, greater than your sickness, more powerful than your enemies. Just because God is silent, doesn\u2019t mean He\u2019s given up. You may not see anything happening, but God is still working. What He promised you is still on the way. You have to believe that when you prayed, the miracle was set into motion.

Then, God\u2019s favor will take you further. If you had what somebody else had it wouldn\u2019t help you, it would hinder you. It wouldn\u2019t be a blessing it would be a burden. Quit wishing you were them, recognize you are enough. Some of the things you\u2019re concerned about, God has already done. You haven\u2019t seen it, but in the unseen realm, things have changed. \n\nClick here to watch, \"It's Just a Matter of Time\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/s2Lx4eQxZT If you just had some evidence, if you just had a little sign, then you would believe.

When nothing has changed and you don\u2019t have any evidence, the key is you have to believe that it happens when you pray. You have to receive it in your spirit before you\u2019ll see it in the natural. Are you waiting for the evidence to believe what God said about you? Are you talking yourself out of it because you don\u2019t see any sign?\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"It's Just a Matter of Time\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/nVnyI0jtqC Hebrews says, \u201cHold fast the confession of your faith.\u201d You have to hold fast to what God put in your heart.

We prayed, we believed, but we don\u2019t see anything improving. What you can\u2019t see is the moment you prayed, in the unseen realm, the source of what was coming against you was cut off: the source of that fear, the source of the addiction, the source of the sickness. The scripture says, \u201cThe strength of the wicked is being cut off, and the power of the godly is being increased.\u201d Everything that\u2019s trying to stop you, that power is being cut off.\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s new message this morning! \"It's Just a Matter of Time\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/1G4yXTPMqw God is faithful. Don\u2019t let the lack of evidence convince you that nothing is happening. In the unseen realm, things are changing in your favor. Forces that have stopped you in the past have been broken. The bigger you make God, the smaller your problems will become, the more faith will rise in your heart. The enemy wouldn\u2019t be trying to stop you if He didn\u2019t know something greater was in front of you. Stay encouraged; the surge is coming. God already knows our weaknesses, our fears, our doubts. You don\u2019t have to have it all together. You\u2019re a work in progress. God\u2019s not finished with you.

There should be people you\u2019re in your life that inspire you, that challenge you, that make you strive to do better. Eventually you\u2019re going to be like the people you\u2019re connected to. Quit looking at what you don\u2019t have, what you can\u2019t do, what you didn\u2019t get. You have everything you need.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"You Are Enough\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/ARi2QKIWTo Things may not change overnight, but if you\u2019ll stay in faith, there will come a time when God will say, \u201cEnough is enough.\" He\u2019s going to turn things around and not just bring you out; He\u2019s going to give you what you are owed. It\u2019s not your battle; the battle is the Lord\u2019s. He\u2019ll not only take care of your opposition, He\u2019ll make it up to you. He\u2019s keeping the records. He knows what you\u2019re owed. When God puts you with eagles, don\u2019t have a chicken mentality. Don\u2019t start talking about how that could never happen for you. Let it take root on the inside. Breathe it all in. Get used to it. That\u2019s where God is taking you. He\u2019s exposing you to new levels. When you realize you are enough by yourself, then you won\u2019t rely on people to approve you. You\u2019ll get your approval from your Heavenly Father. You know you\u2019re made in His image. You know He\u2019s crowned you with favor. Is there something you\u2019re looking for that you already have? You\u2019re looking around you but God is saying, \u201cLook in you.\"  You have the talent, you have the confidence, you have the creativity. You need to see yourself as a no lack person. Don\u2019t be discouraged when what you\u2019re up against is too big, you don\u2019t have the resources, the opposition is stronger. You\u2019re in perfect position for God to show out in your life. You don\u2019t need people\u2019s approval. You don\u2019t need their validation. The Most High God has approved you.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"You Are Enough\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/5VZaejhemv Do you know what your Father has given you? Do you know you have the key to unlock every door to your destiny? You didn\u2019t get shortchanged. God has great confidence in you. He believes in you more than you believe in yourself. God doesn\u2019t make any mistakes. When He created you He wasn\u2019t having a bad day. He didn\u2019t accidentally leave something out. God calls you a masterpiece.  He\u2019s crowned you with His favor. You\u2019re not lacking. You have everything you need to fulfill your destiny. God gave you the talent you need, the creativity, the strength. You didn\u2019t get shortchanged. You are good enough, you are talented enough, you are smart enough, you are attractive enough. You have been fearfully and wonderfully made. It\u2019s not luck; it\u2019s favor. It\u2019s God shining down on you, making things happen that you couldn\u2019t make happen. One of your dreams may have died, but that didn\u2019t stop God\u2019s plan. He has another dream. One relationship may not have worked out, but if you\u2019ll kiss the old goodbye, you\u2019ll see the new God has lined up. When Moses asked God His name. He said, \u201cMy name is I Am.\u201d He was saying, \u201cI am everything. I am protection. I am strength. I am healing. I am provision. I am wisdom.\u201d Nothing can stand against our God. If you\u2019ll take the hand you\u2019ve been dealt and make the most of it, God will open doors you couldn\u2019t open. The favor on your life will take you where you couldn\u2019t go on your own.\n\nCheck out \"Kiss It Goodbye\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/ENZbnxCCc1 You don\u2019t have to see how; all you have to do is believe. When you believe, angels go to work. When you believe, forces of darkness are pushed back. When you believe, things begin to change in your favor. There will always be forces trying to convince us to settle where we are, but you have to stir your faith up. God didn\u2019t bring you this far to leave you. What He started in your life, He\u2019s going to finish. You may not see how it can happen, but He has a way. God already knew what was going to happen. He knew who was going to walk away. All that is getting you prepared for where God is taking you.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Kiss It Goodbye\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/jzgYHxphXk You can\u2019t hold onto the old and expect to receive the new. The past is over and done. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called the past. Quit dwelling on it; quit reliving it. God has a purpose. He knows how to bring good out of it. Keep moving forward. You can\u2019t think the same way and expect different results. Start embracing who God says you are. You are fearfully and wonderfully made. You are a masterpiece. 2020 Blessing\n\nYou are blessed, prosperous, redeemed, forgiven, talented, creative, disciplined, focused, confident, secure, equipped, empowered, anointed, accepted, approved, not average, not mediocre, you are a child of the most high God! https://t.co/nsj6Sd09qr Tell the excuses, \u201cIt is finished.\u201d Tell the discouragement, \u201cIt is finished.\u201d This is a new season. God is about to do a new thing. Happy New Year to you and your family! https://t.co/1OEJOiQNFg You\u2019ve spent enough energy on the past; that\u2019s not taking you anywhere. Kiss the disappointment goodbye. You can\u2019t embrace the new things God has in store as long as you\u2019re holding onto the old. You won\u2019t have the strength to keep moving forward if you\u2019re weeping over what\u2019s behind. It takes a lot of energy to think about the past, to relive hurts.\n\nClick here to watch, \"Kiss It Goodbye\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/p4fdz6ULwD It\u2019s time to kiss some things goodbye. Kiss failure goodbye; this is a new day. Kiss guilt goodbye; you\u2019re forgiven. Kiss what didn\u2019t work out goodbye. God has something better. Our attitude should be, \u201cGod, I trust You not just with my successes, but I trust You with my failures, with the betrayals, with the things that don\u2019t make sense.\u201d When you kiss the past goodbye, it releases you into your future. Don\u2019t bring bitterness into the new year. You can\u2019t embrace the new things God has in store as long as you\u2019re holding onto the old.\n\nListen now to this message from Joel, \"Kiss It Goodbye\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/1yhSVgODj7 People may walk away, life may not turn out the way you had thought, but God has something better in front of you. What you\u2019re not willing to walk away from is where you\u2019ll get stuck. If you don\u2019t let go of the wrong people, you\u2019ll never meet the right people. If someone is not adding value to your life, making you better, pushing you into your destiny, you need to make a change. If you\u2019re going to reach your destiny, you have to learn to kiss some things goodbye.\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s message this morning! \"Kiss It Goodbye\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/DQg7gQm2S1 You won\u2019t have the strength to keep moving forward if you\u2019re weeping over what\u2019s behind. It takes a lot of energy to relive hurts and wonder why it didn\u2019t work out. If it didn\u2019t work out the way you had planned, it wasn\u2019t supposed to. The enemy meant it for your harm. He\u2019d love to convince you to live discouraged, not pursuing dreams, thinking it\u2019s never going to work out. Don\u2019t believe those lies. It\u2019s setting you up for new levels of your destiny. The scripture says, \u201cWhen you seek God first all these things will be added unto you.\u201d God wants to not only meet your needs, He wants to give you the desires of your heart. God knows how to pay you back. He knows what\u2019s not fair. He sees every sparrow. How much more does God see everything that happens to you? God gave you a destiny to fulfill. He has moments of favor where He will make things happen that you couldn\u2019t make happen. \n\nCheck out \"It's Already Set Up\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/p0EYxdCYp1 Your words can limit your life or they can increase your life. They can curse your future or they can bless your future. What you\u2019re saying in the storm will determine whether you come out of that storm. Talk about how big your God is. Are there favor connections God has put in your life that you\u2019re overlooking: people that have what you want, that are further along? Don\u2019t be intimidated by their success; be inspired. People judge by the outside. They\u2019ll try to write you off, but they don\u2019t know what God put in you. They can\u2019t see your seeds of greatness.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"It's Already Set Up\" from Joel!\u00a0\u00a0https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/XeJZW1mhkk You weren\u2019t created to go through life lonely. That person that walked away, that didn\u2019t value you, that told you how you weren\u2019t good enough, attractive enough, smart enough, don\u2019t believe those lies. You are made in the image of God. He calls you a masterpiece. When you live in faith, expecting God\u2019s goodness, there are moments of favor that you\u2019ll come into suddenly. \n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"It's Already Set Up\".

Once we live this day, we can\u2019t get it back. Don\u2019t let a disappointment keep you from enjoying this day. Start dreaming again, start loving again, start laughing again. The scripture says, \u201cGod has purposed it, who can annul?\u201d That\u2019s saying what God has already set up, who can stop it.\n\nClick here to watch, \"It's Already Set Up\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/TU47mIbXON What God has ordained for you will not go to anyone else. Don\u2019t worry about someone getting your promotion, your blessing, your favor, your spouse. What God has prophesied for your life cannot be taken by someone else. God\u2019s already lined up the right people, he\u2019s already set up the breaks you need. Not only are your steps being divinely orchestrated, but God is orchestrating the circumstances around you. You don\u2019t have to try convince someone to be good to you, the people God has ordained to help you, He\u2019s already prepared their hearts.\n\nListen now to this message from Joel, \"It's Already Set Up\": https://t.co/spV2a4pL3j https://t.co/4Jhw7Zao87 You don\u2019t have to figure it out. All you have to do is believe. If you\u2019ll stay in faith you\u2019ll come into these destiny moments where you\u2019ll see what God has already set up. God knows what you\u2019re going to need, when you\u2019re going to need it, and how to get it to you. The problem you\u2019re worried about, God has the answer already in route. The vindication, the healing, the breakthrough, it\u2019s already set up. That problem you think will never turn around, He\u2019s already set up the answer. It\u2019s not a surprise to God. He had the solution before you had the problem. \n\nWatch Joel\u2019s message this morning! \"It's Already Set Up\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/o6XR7SbHNU The scripture says, \u201cNo person has seen heard or imagined what God has prepared for those that love Him.\u201d God has some things prepared that are going to amaze you. What you see may seem small compared to what God promised you, it\u2019s easy to dismiss it and think it\u2019s nothing. But God can take a small cloud and bring a big blessing. He can take what looks insignificant and cause it to turn into something amazing. Keep doing the right thing. Don\u2019t take matters into your own hands. God is your defender. By this time next year, the enemies you see today, you will see no more. By this time next year, what was meant for your harm will be turned to your advantage. You don\u2019t need everybody to be for you; you just need the right people to be for you. God has people in positions of influence that will open doors you couldn\u2019t open, give you opportunity &amp; promotion that you didn\u2019t see coming. You won\u2019t have to find them; they\u2019ll find you. Every seed you sow will come back to you. The mercy you show others is the mercy people will show you.\n\nCheck out \"Keep Believing for Your Loved Ones\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/Sfjojcw78D God doesn\u2019t change His mind. He\u2019s already decided to show you mercy. He\u2019s already decided to heal those wounds and give you another chance. Don\u2019t listen to the lies telling you that, \u201cYou\u2019re washed up, you blew it, just sit on the sidelines.\u201d Get back in the game. God didn\u2019t allow those scars so you could constantly think about your failures and poor choices. He allowed them so you would think about His mercy, His forgiveness. The scripture says, \u201cIf you draw close to God, He\u2019ll draw close to you.\u201d He\u2019s as close as the air you breathe. All you have to do is call out and He\u2019s right there. \n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Keep Believing for Your Loved Ones\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/TOG6jGrh4h The enemy doesn\u2019t fight you for where you are; he fights you for where you\u2019re going. Favor is not going to keep you from the storm, but favor will bring you out of the storm. God wouldn\u2019t have allowed it if He didn\u2019t have a purpose for your good. God waited for us when we were off course. He showed us mercy when we weren\u2019t at our best. Now we need to take that same mercy and show it to someone else.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"Keep Believing for Your Loved Ones\". Check it out here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/EmRKHk2dTm Don\u2019t get bitter and relive all the negative. That scar is a reminder of how faithful God has been. Without His mercy, that mistake would have stopped you. Without His healing, that sickness would have been the end. We all have someone that we\u2019re hoping will change. But if they\u2019re going to reach their destiny, they need someone who will keep praying, keep encouraging, keep speaking faith into their future. The seeds you plant in people\u2019s hearts are still alive. The soil may not be ready yet, but at the right time, God will soften their heart.\n\nClick here to watch, \"Keep Believing for Your Loved Ones\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/sXhXOToSLu Everyone is on a journey.

We write off people too easily. Where they are now is not where they\u2019re going to end up.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Keep Believing for Your Loved Ones\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/MQxMHXbA02 You have to call people what they can become before they\u2019ll ever change. Call your child blessed, call him disciplined, call him focused, call him successful. That friend that\u2019s addicted, start calling him free, whole, victorious. God\u2019s not holding the past against you. He\u2019s not upset because you ignored Him; He\u2019s not turned off because you didn\u2019t believe. He\u2019s waiting for you. His arms are opened wide. It looks like it\u2019s going to take a long time to get well, to break the addiction, to meet the right person. No get ready. It\u2019s going to happen quickly. It\u2019s going to be unusual, out of the ordinary. You\u2019re going to know it\u2019s the hand of God. Will you wait on that friend that\u2019s making bad choices? Will you call them, encourage them, let them know that you care?\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s new message this morning: \"Keep Believing for Your Loved Ones\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/K5o8Y0Jqfl God has people in your life because He\u2019s counting on you, not to judge them, not to find fault, but to stand in the gap. Some of the people that we think are the furthest off course are chosen vessels. God controls the universe. When He\u2019s ready to pay you back, people can't stop Him, bad breaks can\u2019t stop Him, all the forces of darkness can\u2019t keep Him from bringing justice.

If you live with a limited vision, thinking that it could never happen, that it\u2019s so far above anything you\u2019ve ever seen, then you\u2019re right. It\u2019s not going to happen. Don\u2019t live in awe, thinking it\u2019s impossible. God has ways to do it that you\u2019ve never thought of. Some people never succeed because they\u2019re not willing to say goodbye to the familiar. Say goodbye to limited thinking, goodbye to old mindsets.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"Positioned for Increase\". Check it out here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/bUyzMCsd27 What God has in your future, you can\u2019t accomplish on your own. There are places He\u2019s going to take you that you can\u2019t get to by yourself. Maybe in the past you\u2019ve relied on others to encourage you and keep you cheered up. But at some point, you have to stand on your own. You can\u2019t reach your destiny while always depending on someone else. There are set times where God\u2019s favor will show out.

God is not doing that to make your life more difficult; He\u2019s getting you in position for increase. When you know you\u2019re supposed to take a step of faith, don\u2019t stay where it\u2019s comfortable. You can\u2019t play it safe all your life and be who you were created to be. You have to say goodbye to some things to keep moving forward.

If He didn\u2019t stop certain things, we would never get out of our comfort zone; we would stay with what's familiar. Fear and faith have something in common. They both ask us to believe something is going to happen that we cannot see. Your value is not based on what you do, who you know, or how many people celebrate you; that\u2019s all superficial. That can change. Your value comes from your Creator. You can be at peace with your scars. Nothing you\u2019ve done is a surprise to God. He knew every mistake you would make. He knew every time you\u2019d go the wrong way. He wouldn\u2019t have allowed it if it was going to keep you from your purpose.

What God breathes life into, sickness cannot take away. What God blesses, all the forces of darkness cannot curse. It\u2019s easy to trust Him when we\u2019re getting good breaks, things are going great, but you have to learn to trust Him in the night seasons: when things aren\u2019t going your way and you don\u2019t see anything happening. You can\u2019t live without wrongs being done to you.

The question is, how do you respond? Jesus said, \u201cWhen somebody takes your shirt, give them your coat too. When they ask you to walk a mile, go two miles.\u201d People can\u2019t undo every wrong they've done to you.

Many things God asks us to do are not fair. It\u2019s not about being fair; it\u2019s about passing the test. If you\u2019ll do the right thing when it\u2019s hard, God will make it up to you. It\u2019s easy to be good to people that are being good to us. The test is when they\u2019ve betrayed you, and now they need your help.

Show mercy when you have the advantage; lift someone up when they pushed you down. Everyone is dealing with something. There are no perfect people. A true friend will accept you where you are, faults, weaknesses, shortcomings and all. The scripture says, \u201cA good person falls seven times but gets back up again.\u201d You have come back power. God wouldn\u2019t have allowed the adversity if it was going to finish you off. It\u2019s just another step on the way to your destiny. Some things you just have to outlast.

He said, \u201cMy name is I Am.\u201d He was saying, \u201cI Am everything. I Am protection. I Am strength. I Am healing. I Am provision. I Am wisdom.\u201d Nothing can stand against our God. If you let people discourage you, bad breaks talk you out of it, delays cause you to quit believing, then it\u2019s going to keep you from God\u2019s best. God wants to heal you, to increase you, to take you where you couldn\u2019t go on your own.\n\nPreorder your copy today: https://t.co/NEBQDg1Kxs\n\n#PowerFavorBook https://t.co/gXl84aIEqv If you\u2019ll outlast the opposition, you\u2019ll see the victory.

God being for you is more than the world being against you. Don\u2019t fight with your critics; outlast them. Let your actions speak for you; let your success do the talking. God is setting you up to show out in your life. He allowed that opposition to last, not because it\u2019s going to stop you, but because it\u2019s going to promote you. It\u2019s going to push you into a new level of your destiny. Stay on the high road. Let God be your vindicator. Let Him pay your enemies back. He sees what\u2019s happening.  Listen now to this new message from Joel, \"Outlast the Opposition\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/0U91FAFSL7 The way you win some battles is not by defeating the opposition, but by outlasting the opposition. You have to have staying power. Don\u2019t give up because it\u2019s not happening on your timetable. Don\u2019t expect everything to be easy. Don\u2019t expect everyone to be for you. If it hasn\u2019t happened yet, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not going to happen. The victory is on the other side of the opposition. Something happens in the struggle, when your mind says it\u2019s never going to work out, but in your heart, you know what God promised is on the way.\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s new message this morning! \"Outlast the Opposition\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/Gyb0YJ1VuK When life tries to push you down, step on you, take your health, squash your dreams, you have to get back up again. Outlast what\u2019s trying to defeat you. The power in you is greater than any power that\u2019s trying to stop you. They may write you off, but don\u2019t worry, God has already written you in. He chose you before you could choose Him. The scripture says His calling on your life is irrevocable. God said in Psalms, \u201cTouch not My anointed.\u201d You are His anointed. When people come against you, they\u2019re not just messing with you; they\u2019re messing with the God who put the blessing on you. What God has blessed, no person can curse. You don\u2019t have to try to hide your scars, be embarrassed by what you\u2019ve been through. You can be at peace with your scars. Those scars are your testimony. Those scars are your story. Good breaks are going to find you. Opportunity is going to chase you down.\n\nPreorder your copy today: https://t.co/NEBQDg1Kxs\n\n#PowerFavorBook https://t.co/rHMsUmVOrf In your mind, is your name \u201cborn to lose\u201d or \u201cborn to win\u201d?

He\u2019s your defender. He\u2019s your vindicator, your healer, your provider, your way maker. The blessing on your life will override the curse. What people have spoken over you or what they haven\u2019t spoken over you hasn\u2019t changed what\u2019s in you. It hasn\u2019t lessened your potential. There is greatness in you. You can\u2019t stop people from saying negative things, but you are not what people call you. You are what you answer to.\n\nDon't miss this powerful message, \"Change Your Name\" from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/aM7tZojSPM You have to be you. There\u2019s no anointing on your life to be like someone else. You are anointed to be you. When you see that scar, don\u2019t think of the pain; think of the grace of God. The scar means the wound has healed. The scar means the pain is over and you\u2019re moving forward. God calls you a son of strength. He knows who you are; He knows what you\u2019re capable of.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"Change Your Name\". Check it out here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/ZERW4oVceX Your talent may seem small compared to the dream God put in your heart, but that talent, with the blessing, will take you further than you can imagine. When you learn to change your name back to who you were created to be, all the forces of darkness cannot stop you. You\u2019re a son of strength, equipped, empowered, talented, and surrounded by God\u2019s favor. Don\u2019t let negative things people have spoken over you, how you were raised, what you didn\u2019t get, determine your destiny.\n\nClick here to watch, \"Change Your Name\": https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/Pew4OFVyal The real victory is not when God does everything you want, takes away every frustration. The real victory is when those things happen, but it doesn\u2019t bother you anymore. You\u2019re at peace. You know God is still in control. You are just one good break away from God catapulting you to a new level.\n\nPreorder your copy today: https://t.co/NEBQDg1Kxs\n\n#PowerFavor https://t.co/zFzAjJHYdQ Thank you @KanyeWest for visiting Lakewood. The Sunday Service Experience was amazing. We loved having you and The Collective. God bless you and your family! https://t.co/2CzrkPoi8V People may call you many things, but you don\u2019t have to let it get in you. Go back to who God says you are. He calls you one of a kind, a history maker. He calls you a son of strength, a daughter of destiny. Have you let life name you addicted, limited, always struggling? Or do you go by what God named you: free, victorious, overcomer, well-able?\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Change Your Name\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/VtkxyYB3Ca What God names you overrides what people name you. They may name you son of sorrow, daughter of pain, son of misery, but God names you daughter of victory, son of favor, daughter of blessing. Who do you believe you are? When God breathed life into you, He named you blessed, prosperous, talented, victorious, one of a kind.\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s new message this morning! \"Change Your Name\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/PTUejr9yaz What you continually hear starts to get down on the inside. You will become what you believe. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to have the right names. \u201cI am blessed. I am prosperous. I am healthy.\u201d You are not what people call you; you are what you answer to. Answer to victorious, answer to more than a conqueror, answer to fearfully and wonderfully made. If it wasn\u2019t for His goodness, His mercy, His strength, we wouldn\u2019t be here. God is counting on us. What you\u2019ve been through will help somebody else get through. God has amazing things in your future, things you\u2019ve never imagined. But to get there, you\u2019re going to have to defeat some giants, overcome some obstacles, outlast some opposition. God never said we would understand everything along the way. He didn\u2019t promise that there wouldn\u2019t be any pain, suffering, disappointments. But He did promise that it would all work out for our good. That problem is not there to stop you; it\u2019s there to prepare you.

He's about to do something so big, so unusual, so out of the ordinary, that there won\u2019t be any doubt that His favor is on your life. In our weaknesses, God\u2019s strength shows up the greatest. Take the pressure off. There\u2019s freedom when you can be at peace with not being perfect. Sometimes God doesn't remove the obstacle because He\u2019s using the obstacle to develop us.

God doesn\u2019t condemn you. He\u2019s not finding fault. He has mercy for every mistake, grace for every weakness, faith for every fear. When you\u2019re honest with God, when you\u2019re real, He doesn\u2019t turn away. He comes to you. You don\u2019t have to hide your doubts, hide your fears. God already knows everything about you. He knows how you feel. Some of the challenges that you\u2019re facing, things that don\u2019t make sense, they don\u2019t have anything to do with now; they're positioning you for something in your future.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"Everything Serves His Plan\".\nhttps://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/Nm3ohNDRAW If you\u2019re going to reach your highest potential, you have to stay committed. Make up your mind that you\u2019re in it for the long haul. It may be difficult, you may have a good reason to walk away, but don\u2019t take the easy way out. You can\u2019t pray away every difficulty; you can\u2019t pray away everything you don\u2019t like. If the situation is not changing, then God is using the situation to change you. People can\u2019t override what God has ordained for you. Bad breaks, delays, detours, injustice can\u2019t stop your destiny.

It means He\u2019s going to increase your strength, so it doesn\u2019t feel as difficult. Stand strong and show the opposition that you\u2019re more determined than they are. That problem is not there to stop you; it\u2019s there to prepare you. That challenge is not going to defeat you; it\u2019s going to promote you. You have to trust God when you don\u2019t understand.

When you understand that everything serves His plan, you won\u2019t live frustrated by things that aren\u2019t fair, stressed over things you don\u2019t like, upset because it\u2019s taking so long. It\u2019s easy to get frustrated and fight against things we don\u2019t like. \u201cGod, why is this happening, when are You going to change it?\u201d We think it\u2019s holding us back, but Psalm 119 says, \u201cEverything serves His plan.\u201d God wouldn\u2019t have allowed it if He didn\u2019t have a purpose.

The problem with getting your validation from people is that people change. Quit relying on people and go to God. You have His approval; you don\u2019t need everyone else\u2019s approval. What\u2019s come against you hasn\u2019t been random. The enemy is strategic.

Frustration is a test. Are you going to let it steal your joy, or are you going to be still and know that He is God?

Get ready; peace is coming, favor is coming, victory is coming. You\u2019re going to see God override what\u2019s trying to stop you. There\u2019s no storm too strong that He can\u2019t calm.

He\u2019ll move people out of the way; He\u2019ll silence the opposition. The enemy wouldn\u2019t have wasted so much time and energy on you if there wasn\u2019t something amazing in front of you. Don\u2019t complain about what didn\u2019t work out. God is still working. He\u2019ll make up for what was unfair. He\u2019ll pay you back for the wrongs.

In fact, when it\u2019s not fair, when you\u2019re the underdog, when life has tried to stop you, that\u2019s when God will show out the most. Many of the challenges you\u2019ve faced, the things that don\u2019t seem fair, the obstacles that came out of nowhere, the people that turned on you, it\u2019s because there\u2019s a history maker in you. You may not see it yet, but even the enemy can see that there is greatness in you. David said in Psalm 30, \u201cI praise You oh Lord, for You refused to let my enemies triumph over me.\u201d God\u2019s purpose is more powerful than the enemy\u2019s plan.\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s new message this morning! \"The Fight for Your Future:\"\nhttps://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/t2badcbmFr There is a fight for your future, but what I want you to see is that it\u2019s not your battle. God is fighting for you. The enemy may send the storm, opposition that looks too big, but don\u2019t worry; God controls the winds. He overrides every negative force. Forgive the people that did you wrong. They hurt you once; don\u2019t let them continue to hurt you. They can\u2019t stop your destiny unless you allow them to. You\u2019re not forgiving for their sake; you\u2019re forgiving for your sake. Instead of dwelling on all the negatives\u2014the worry, the past, the problem, the addiction\u2014start dwelling on the greatness of our God. In Scripture David said, \u201cI don\u2019t look to the mountains for help; I look to the God who made the mountains.\u201d It may not be easy, but your destiny is calling. You have greatness in you. Don\u2019t let people talk you out of it; don\u2019t let circumstances convince you that you can\u2019t. Disappointment is simply a season; it\u2019s not the rest of your life.

When you\u2019re honest with God about your doubts, your shortcomings, your fears, that\u2019s not weakness; that\u2019s strength. Committed people outlast the difficulty. Committed people go the extra mile and do more than they have to. They see dreams come to pass. Is there something you\u2019re tempted to give up on? Stay committed, stay determined, stay faithful. It\u2019s very freeing when you can let things go and say, \u201cGod, they did me wrong, but You\u2019re my vindicator.

God won\u2019t bless who you pretend to be. When we pretend, when we try to impress people and live for our image, that puts pressure on us. Take off the mask. You can be real.

You can\u2019t stop life from happening to you, but you can choose how you respond. If you hold on to the hurt, if you dwell on the offense, then you\u2019re opening the door to bitterness.

If you\u2019re always feeding your history, you\u2019re going to be frustrated, discouraged, guilty, bitter. Start feeding your destiny. It may be impossible to you, but it\u2019s not to our God.

It would be much easier if we could see the promise on the way.

If you\u2019ll tell what God has done, speak life and healing, share your skills, talents, resources, then there\u2019s no limit to how high God will take you. Don\u2019t be moved by what you don\u2019t see, by what you don\u2019t have, by who\u2019s against you. God being for you is more than the world being against you.

If you only consider the circumstances, you\u2019ll get discouraged and give up. Don\u2019t consider your circumstances; consider your God. Our attitude should be, \u201cI know what God promised me is still alive. I\u2019m not moved by what I feel. I\u2019m not moved by what\u2019s not working out, by how long it\u2019s been, by what hasn\u2019t improved. I know what God started in my life He will finish.\u201d When you can see it, it doesn\u2019t take much faith. The test comes when you don\u2019t see any sign of what you\u2019re believing for.\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s new message this morning! \"Believing When You're Not Seeing\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/oVH1WiEi6E Many times, before a promise comes to pass, you have to go through a season of silence where you don\u2019t see anything changing. This is when many people give up on what they\u2019re believing for. But just because you don\u2019t see anything happening doesn\u2019t mean God is not working. Let\u2019s lift people up. Show them the mercy you would want shown to you. They have enough things pushing them down. Let\u2019s be that friend that sticks with them when they don\u2019t deserve it. You have to be still and know that He is God. Worry drains your energy, steals your joy, takes your creativity. Quit thinking about the problem and start thanking God that He\u2019s working. Psalm 47 says, \u201cGod reigns over the nations.\u201d The right attitude is, \u201cGod, You don\u2019t just reign over the world, You reign over my health, You reign over my finances, You reign over my family, You reign over my enemies.\u201d The scripture says, \u201cGod is a very present help in trouble.\u201d When you\u2019re in trouble, God is right there with you. He comes into the prison, into the hospital, into the difficulty.\n\nCheck out this message now on Podcast! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/k8QpyBDwXZ Step into who God created you to be. There are talents that you haven\u2019t discovered. As you take steps of faith, God will make things happen that you couldn\u2019t make happen. Don\u2019t bury your talent; bury your fears and release your talent. Live faith-based, not fear-based. You\u2019re not a mistake; you\u2019re not an accident. Don\u2019t let someone\u2019s lack of approval keep you from your destiny. No person can stop your destiny, no bad break, no sickness, no opposition. You\u2019re going to look back and say, \u201cWhat I thought was setting me back, was setting me up to go further than I ever dreamed.\u201d\n\nDon't miss this powerful message from Joel!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/UYQMIVzFNm You didn\u2019t get here by yourself. God was directing your steps. Behind the scenes, you couldn\u2019t see it, but He was pushing back the opposition. He was favoring you. That wasn\u2019t good luck. That was the goodness of God. Quit looking to people. Start looking to God. He controls your destiny. No person, no boss, no company can stand against Him. He determines how high you\u2019re going to go. He sees what\u2019s going on. He knows what\u2019s not fair. You may think you\u2019re too old to accomplish your dream, but it\u2019s on the way. You may think it\u2019s too late to start your business, but it\u2019s on the way. Trust His timing.\n\nBe inspired by this new message from Joel. Check it out here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/lk45JJPS5y The whole time, God is in control. He already has the solution. The mistake we make too often is that we take God off the throne and we put our problem on the throne. Stay in peace, your time is coming. Doors of opportunity are going to open. You\u2019re going to see vindication, promotion, opportunity. No one can\u2019t keep you from your purpose. Even if we let fear, insecurity, intimidation cause us to shrink back, God says, \"That\u2019s no problem for Me. Fear can\u2019t keep Me out; depression can\u2019t stop what I have for you; limited thinking can\u2019t hold Me back.\"\n\nClick here to watch Joel's newest message: https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/cc9vTgo3U8 Here\u2019s the key, you and God are a majority. What He has destined for your life will override anyone or anything trying to stop you. Even if someone is against you, they can\u2019t keep you from getting to where you\u2019re supposed to be. God knows what\u2019s in you; He knows what you\u2019re capable of. He\u2019s not going to let fear hold you back. He\u2019s not going to let the negative things people have spoken over you keep you from moving forward. It may seem like the door has closed on your dreams. Every circumstance says it\u2019s too late. You need to thank God that He\u2019s making a way when you don\u2019t see a way.  \n\nListen now to this new message from Joel!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/GePGYCPYOy God can go around what\u2019s blocking you. He can go over who\u2019s trying to stop you. He can go through the opposition. He can move someone that\u2019s holding you back out of the way. God sees potential in you that you can\u2019t see in yourself. He\u2019s going to present you with opportunities that seem way over your head. Don\u2019t shrink back. You are well able. People can\u2019t keep you out of your purpose; obstacles can\u2019t keep you from what God has ordained for you.\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s new message this morning!  https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/vbET11sW6k God is not just a way maker. He is the way. That\u2019s why He\u2019s called the great I AM.  \"I AM whatever you need, I AM favor, I AM breakthroughs, I AM healing, I AM abundance.\" Don\u2019t let circumstances pull you out of rest. Don\u2019t let panicked people cause you to panic. Don\u2019t focus on the size of the problem. Focus on the size of our God. He controls the universe. You have to walk by faith and not by sight. Your faith is going to turn things around. Your faith is going to bring new opportunities. Your faith is going to bring unexpected favor. Don\u2019t be discouraged by what\u2019s not fair. God sees what\u2019s happening. Keep being your best. Keep honoring Him. You\u2019re not working unto people; you\u2019re working unto God. God is going to bring to life dreams you\u2019ve given up on. Promises He put in you as a child are about to come to pass. Now, do your part and look again. Start expecting, start believing, get your hopes up.\n\nCheck out \"Look Again\" on the Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/e8B57PLraO You don\u2019t need friends that only like you for what you can do for them and not for who you are. Make a change and God will give you true friends. God didn\u2019t design you to reach a certain level and stay there. Where you are is not your final destination. God said, \u201cThe path of the righteous gets brighter and brighter.\u201d This is a new day. God is breathing in your direction right now. He\u2019s going to give you favor that you haven\u2019t had.

They handed you the baton. All their sacrifices have put us much further down the road. The way to honor their legacy is to go further, to dream big. You may have some things you don\u2019t understand, you can\u2019t figure out. Maybe you don\u2019t see an answer, but that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to see it. Don\u2019t get discouraged. God is working behind the scenes. Stir your faith up. What you\u2019ve given up on, those promises you\u2019ve let go of, those dreams you think are too far gone, start believing again.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \"Look Again\". Check it out here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/bVmAGMj6Rj What we take in through our eyes and ears gets into our subconscious mind. Be aware of what pulls you out of rest. Sometimes, it\u2019s our own choices. Who told you you\u2019re not going to love again? Who told you you\u2019re not going to be healthy again? Who told you you\u2019re not going to accomplish that dream? Don\u2019t believe those lies. Start looking again. Start dreaming again. Start believing again. When you keep looking, you\u2019re saying, \u201cGod, I believe You\u2019ll do what You promised.

This is not the time to get discouraged; this is not the time to let circumstances talk you out of it. You\u2019re close to your breakthrough.\u201d Keep the attitude of, \u201cIt\u2019s on the way. Any moment, it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Expectancy, looking for it, believing it\u2019s going to happen, that\u2019s your faith being released. That\u2019s what allows God to do amazing things. You may have had some disappointments, but don\u2019t settle where you are. Don\u2019t give up on what God put in your heart. Weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.\n\nListen now to this new message from Joel, \"Look Again\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/nRKZwXCICy It may not have happened yet, but look again. That setback didn\u2019t cancel God\u2019s plan. It was a setup for God to take you further. What God started in your life, He\u2019s going to finish. He is still going to do what He promised. As long as you think it will never work out, that\u2019s going to keep you from the new things God has in store. Start believing again. Just because it hasn\u2019t happened yet doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not going to happen. Don\u2019t believe those lies. It may feel like it\u2019s over, but God is saying, \u201cLook again. That dream you\u2019ve given up on, I\u2019m still going to bring it to pass.\u201d\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s new message this morning! \"Look Again\" https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/lLZwa0HJRe When you\u2019re honest with God and you\u2019re bold enough to ask, get ready for God to thrust you into your destiny. God wouldn\u2019t have given you that dream if He wasn\u2019t planning to bring it to pass. Don\u2019t talk yourself out of it. Here\u2019s a key, God doesn\u2019t define you by your mistakes; He refines you by your mistakes. He uses the failures, the times we blow it, the times we go the wrong way, to do a work in us. Quit being discouraged over what didn\u2019t work out. It feels like you failed, but that\u2019s not the end of your story.  You\u2019re in a time of testing. There\u2019s something bigger God has in your future. It\u2019s not enough to just pray; you have to follow it up with expectancy. God not only heard you, but He also dispatched an angel with the answer. The moment you asked God to forgive you, He forgave you. Not only that, He doesn\u2019t remember your mistakes. Check out \"Don't Be Defined By Your Mistakes\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/WpSBV6234h God reigns over everything that comes into your life. He may not have sent it, but if He allowed it, He\u2019s in control. He knows how to bring good out of it. Go over your history and see how God has never left you, how He kept you from that accident, brought the right person. When you look back at your history, it will give you fuel for your destiny. God is about to do a new thing. Put on some new labels: free, whole, restored. Don't miss this powerful message, \"Don't Be Defined By Your Mistakes\" from Joel! https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ https://t.co/lQemtzuT12 Sometimes we love a person so much, we want something so badly, that we\u2019re trying to be God. Our part is to believe, to pray, to be a good example, but at some point, you have to say, \u201cGod, they\u2019re in Your hands. I trust You to do what only You can do.\u201d That sickness may be big, but it\u2019s no match for our God. Keep Him on the throne. Quit thinking about how big your problem is and start thinking about how big your God is. God doesn\u2019t judge you by one mistake. His calling on your life is irrevocable. You may have counted yourself out, but God has already counted you in.\n\nBe inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cDon't Be Defined By Your Mistakes\u201d.

You\u2019re still victorious. The only person that can stop you is you. If you let your mistakes define you, if you wear the labels people stick on you, if you believe the lies of the accuser, then that will keep you from your destiny.

Do yourself a favor; remove those labels and put on what God says about you:  \nRedeemed \nForgiven\nBlessed\nRestored\nQualified\nVictorious God is breathing in your direction. He calls you a masterpiece. If anyone calls you any different, delete it. If they make you feel any different, delete it. You may have been through disappointments, life has thrown you a curve, but you have to get your fire back. God didn\u2019t bring you this far to leave you. Your greatest days in your health, your relationships, your career, are still in front of you. You can\u2019t keep making excuses; reliving the negative. You\u2019re waiting on God, but God\u2019s waiting on you. When you move forward, that\u2019s when you\u2019ll see things begin to change.

Put up a boundary and say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to live in somebody else\u2019s world. I\u2019m going to run my race.\u201d What God has spoken over you will come to pass.

You can\u2019t control what people do; you can\u2019t control what they say. You can control how you respond. Don't give away your joy.

Thoughts will tell you all the reasons why it\u2019s not going happen: \u201cYou\u2019re too old. You come from the wrong family. You don\u2019t have the education.

Get your passion back and go after the destiny that belongs to you. Mediocrity is not your home, good enough is not your destiny, getting by is not where you belong. You may be there now, but that is not your permanent location. Yes, we should be content, but you shouldn\u2019t be satisfied with less than what you know God put in your heart.

If you\u2019re going to become all you were created to be, you have to keep a fire in your spirit. Instead of dwelling on all the negatives\u2014the worry, the past, the problem, the addiction\u2014start dwelling on the greatness of our God. David said, \u201cI don\u2019t look to the mountains for help; I look to the God who made the mountains.\u201d God promised He would arm you with strength for every battle. We may not know what the future holds, but we know Who holds the future. Don\u2019t miss today worried about tomorrow. Today is a gift. Too often, we\u2019re worried about something that\u2019s out of our control.  When we worry, we\u2019re making our problem our God. Put God back on the throne. Use that same energy to thank God that He\u2019s in control.

God sees what\u2019s happening. He hates when a person sows discord, so you can be assured He\u2019s not going to let them succeed. The good news is you don\u2019t have to fight.

You don\u2019t have to impress people; you don\u2019t have to prove anything. Take the pressure off.

People may have written you off, but God doesn\u2019t write you off. When you hear those voices telling you that you\u2019ve blown it, you missed your chance, that means you\u2019re listening to the wrong voices.

Don't miss \"Call It In\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/AY25sWfCho Trust Him when you don\u2019t understand; be comfortable not knowing. The scripture says, \u201cLean not to your own understanding.\u201d Don\u2019t be impatient for God to act. Don\u2019t be frustrated by what\u2019s not happening. God is working. You\u2019re being prepared for what God has prepared for you. The reason some people are not for you, the reason they don\u2019t encourage you is because God didn\u2019t put the dream in them; He put the dream in you. They can\u2019t see what you see. Listen now to this message from Joel, \u201cCall It In\u201d. Get it here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/88jB08Lwb5 Make this decision, \u201cThis is a new day. I\u2019m going to live in rest. I know God is directing my steps, He\u2019s fighting my battles, and He\u2019ll get me to where I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d The scripture says, \u201cLet the weak say I am strong.\u201d It doesn\u2019t say let the weak say I am weak. That\u2019s calling in more weakness. Don\u2019t say what you feel, say what God says about you. God will bring things across your path that are above and beyond anything you\u2019ve imagined. The key is, don\u2019t cancel out the greatness of God\u2019s favor with a limited vision.

Call in favor, call in influence, call in your destiny. That\u2019s your faith being released. If you\u2019ll call yourself blessed, blessing will come. If you\u2019ll call yourself healthy, healing will come. If you\u2019ll call yourself favored, favor will come.

You have to take the next step and call it in. Words give life to our faith. God sees what you can become. Stir up your dreams. Stir up what\u2019s in your heart. God wouldn\u2019t have put it there if He wasn\u2019t going to bring it to pass. It\u2019s easy to live uptight, frustrated, worried, but most of the things that are upsetting us, in the big picture, don\u2019t really matter. You\u2019re alive; you\u2019re healthy. God has given you breath to breathe. He\u2019s given you a family to love. Stay amazed at what God has done in your life. Go back over the times He\u2019s made a way, where He protected you and brought you out of trouble. It may not be easy, but your destiny is calling. You have greatness in you. Don\u2019t let people talk you out of it; don\u2019t let circumstances convince you that you can\u2019t.

The scripture says, \u201cFaith without works is dead.\u201d Wishing is not going to get you anywhere. God sees what you can become. Stir up your dreams. Stir up what\u2019s in your heart.

You have to be more determined than the opposition. If you give up every time things don\u2019t go your way, you don\u2019t want it bad enough. Your destiny is too important to spend it with people that are not making you better. Who are you allowing to influence you? Are they inspiring you, challenging you, pushing you forward? You don\u2019t have time to waste with people that bring out the worst in you. When you make up your mind that you\u2019re going to do something, God will breathe on your efforts and give you strength that goes beyond your natural ability. Who are you allowing to influence you?

I\u2019m going to pursue what God put in my heart.\u201d Every person has negative words spoken over them, people that will try to hold you back, discourage you.

It\u2019s time to put on a new recording in your mind, \u201cYou are equipped. You are empowered. You are anointed. You have what it takes. You\u2019ve been crowned with favor.\u201d Your gift may seem small, but when you develop it, new opportunites will open. You don\u2019t have to have a great gift for God to use you in a great way. The scripture says, \u201cYour gift will make room for you.\u201d Some people may be dismissing you, not giving you credit, trying to make you feel less than. Don\u2019t worry. One day, they\u2019re going to want what you have. God is preparing a table before you in the presence of your enemies. Every failure is preparing you. Don't be so afraid of failure that you don\u2019t get out of your comfort zone. You will learn more through failure than you will through success. You\u2019ll learn more in the difficult times than you will in the good times.

Bad enough to outlast your enemies, bad enough to overlook some insults, bad enough to do the right thing when the wrong thing is happening? There\u2019s a lot of noise these days, a lot of drama, things we can get pulled into: worry, offense, doubt, jealousy. That may be around us, but it doesn\u2019t have to get in us.

It\u2019s time to step into who God created you to be. You have greatness in you. There are talents that you haven\u2019t discovered.

Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast! \"Be Comfortable Not Knowing\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/VdXA5jxrbc When you stay in faith even when you don\u2019t have the answers, when you believe though every thought says there\u2019s no way, God will show out in your life. He\u2019ll cause you to defy the odds and go places you couldn\u2019t go on your own. We are praying for the families and people of El Paso, Texas who have been hurt by this senseless act. We stand with you and know that God will never leave you or forsake you. May you find peace and comfort in His love. People may have tried to push you down, but God is going to lift you up. They are powerless to stop God's blessing. Your job is not to try to make people like you, to try to change people\u2019s minds about you. Your job is to run your race, to be who God has called you to be. Don't worry about the critics and the naysayers. Even when we\u2019re a long way off, even when we don\u2019t have it all together, even when we\u2019re still broken, our Father comes running to embrace us. Make sure you check out \"The Love of the Father\" from @JonathanOsteen here!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/xah9U1QIQY The enemy wants you to curse your future with negative words and thinking. Instead of agreeing, start prophesying victory and favor. You may have big challenges, every voice is telling you it\u2019s not going to work out, but speak the blessing not the curse. People may try to discredit you, push you down. Don\u2019t pay them any attention. They don\u2019t carry any weight. What they say cannot keep you from your destiny. They are simply a distraction. God is a good father. There\u2019s nothing He wouldn\u2019t do for you. When we were at our worst, He loved us. That\u2019s the Father\u2019s heart. Don't miss \"The Love of the Father\" from @JonathanOsteen now on Podcast!  \nhttps://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/MHPTPpExDD If God made a mistake with you, you would be the first one. Trust Him when you\u2019re under construction. Trust Him when you\u2019re in messy places. Trust Him when you\u2019re sure it\u2019s a mistake. You\u2019ve been blessed; now be a blessing. You\u2019ve overcome that addiction; help someone else overcome. You\u2019ve been promoted; help someone else be promoted. Give away what you\u2019ve been given. When we see God as our Father, we can enter with our head held high, knowing He is rich in mercy and ready to help. \u201cThe Love of the Father\" from @JonathanOsteen will inspire you! Get it here: \nhttps://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/Q30ByhYS5z Life is too short to live frustrated, upset about things that, many times, we have no control over. People have a right to have their opinion, but you have a right to ignore it. People have a right to be rude, but you have a right to stay happy. The Creator of the Universe put His blessing on you, and everything else is of no effect. If you\u2019ll stay in faith, the blessing will override the curse. It was meant to harm you, but God will use it to promote you. Prayer is just talking to God. He wants to hear the details. He wants to be involved in your life. Nothing\u2019s too small. Find encouragement in this message from @JonathanOsteen. Check out, \"The Love of the Father\u201d: https://t.co/eeXK2KQPk8 https://t.co/Pf2EHRxozD The enemy wouldn\u2019t be fighting you so hard unless he knew you were close to your victory. Do your part and get your fire back. Start taking hold of God\u2019s strength. Don\u2019t allow that weariness in. The Scripture says the things we see are only temporary, but what we hear, what God speaks to us, that\u2019s permanent. Your Heavenly Father is the one who breathed life into you. He\u2019s the one who gave you your personality, your talent, your uniqueness. Tune in now to this incredible new message from @JonathanOsteen, \"The Love of the Father\":  https://t.co/eeXK2KQPk8 https://t.co/uzl4Ix61gH If you\u2019re not giving anything away, nothing new is going to come. Whether or not you keep the blessing depends on what you do with the blessing. When you\u2019re always lifting people, encouraging them, making them better, then blessings are always going to come to you. God\u2019s not distant. He\u2019s not unapproachable. He\u2019s not mad at us. He\u2019s madly in love with us. Watch this powerful message from @JonathanOsteen out now on Podcast. \"The Love of the Father\" https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/a0gOnG6aK4 People can\u2019t stop you; bad breaks can\u2019t stop you; injustice can\u2019t stop you. The commanded blessing on your life will override any force that\u2019s trying to hold you back. Sometimes we don\u2019t realize who we are. You may feel average and ordinary, but because of your Maker, there\u2019s something about you that makes you extremely valuable. When you see what God is up to, you\u2019ll say it was worth the wait. He\u2019s a God who exceeds expectations. Start making good decisions. Start honoring God, living with excellence and integrity. When you do this, mistakes of the past don\u2019t have to stop your destiny. It\u2019s very powerful when you can say, \u201cGod, I trust not only Your ways, but I trust Your timing.\u201d Check out \"It's Worth the Wait\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/fF55hURCVp Sometimes we\u2019re putting pressure on people to keep us fixed, keep us encouraged, keep us complimented. Let them off the hook. They\u2019re not your savior. You have a Savior. He\u2019s on the throne. Go to Him and not to people. Don\u2019t have a weak mentality; have a warrior mentality. You have to be more determined than the opposition. If you give up every time things don\u2019t go your way, you don\u2019t want it bad enough. You may not like it, but you can\u2019t bypass the process. You can\u2019t skip the waiting room and reach the fullness of your destiny. Don't miss \"It's Worth the Wait\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4pL3j https://t.co/8fV106jCIu Value is not based on what you do or who you know. That\u2019s all superficial. Your value comes from your Creator. Don\u2019t compare your life to other people. Run your race. God\u2019s purpose for your life is not the same as theirs. Don\u2019t look to the left or to the right. Stay focused on your calling. There\u2019s nothing you can do to make God love you any more or any less. It\u2019s a gift. Just receive it. The difference between a dream and wish is that a wish is something you just hope happens, but a dream you put actions behind. God is working. You\u2019re being prepared for what God has prepared for you. The reason it\u2019s taken longer than you thought is because it\u2019s going to be better than you thought. Click here to listen to, \"It's Worth the Wait\u201d: https://t.co/eeXK2KQPk8 https://t.co/S2n1a6q4GA The situation you\u2019re in may not be changing. Don\u2019t worry; you\u2019re changing. Patience is working. You\u2019re getting stronger, more determined. It\u2019s preparing you. There's a price to pay to get prepared. You\u2019re doing the right thing, but nothing is changing, you have the promise, but you\u2019re not making progress. Something is happening that you can\u2019t see: you\u2019re developing, you\u2019re growing. Stay faithful where you are. If you\u2019ll wait with a positive attitude, then after patience has done its work, you\u2019re going to see the promise come to pass. Tune in now to this new message from Joel, \"It's Worth the Wait\": Video: https://t.co/kMfAhXGqHJ \nAudio: https://t.co/eeXK2KQPk8 https://t.co/bHCjrLfws5 We think of waiting as negative; we don\u2019t like it when nothing is happening. We\u2019re interested in the destination, but God is interested in the journey. He\u2019s working on us along the way. Waiting doesn\u2019t mean that nothing is happening, that God\u2019s forgotten about us. It\u2019s all a part of the process. We can live in faith knowing that, at the right time, God will get us to where we\u2019re supposed to be. When it\u2019s your time, when God knows you\u2019re ready, what you give birth to is going to be much bigger than you think. Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast! \"It's Worth the Wait\":                       \nAudio: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/vOVqwdaOzU Sometimes, it\u2019s not happening because we\u2019re not prepared for what God has prepared. If you could see what God has in mind, you would realize you couldn\u2019t handle it right now. You need more time to develop, to grow, to gain experience. Let God make you and mold you. Stay pliable. We should be better this year than we were last year. We should be making progress. Don\u2019t let the mess become normal. You don\u2019t have to go after the blessing; go after God. Honor Him with your life, and the blessing will follow. God brought you out, not just for your sake, not just so you could shine. He brought you out so you could help somebody else shine. Go after the hurting. Go after the broken, the addicted, those that have messed up.  Go after them with something more powerful, with love, with mercy, with the goodness of God. Check out this message from Joel on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/NaJ4f2jx90 You may have some obstacles in your path, situations that are not fair, that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have favor. Challenges come to us all, but favor is why you\u2019re not going to stay down. Favor causes you to rise to the top. The enemy will whisper, \u201cYou have too many flaws, too many weaknesses. You\u2019ve made too many mistakes.\u201d Just remind him, \u201cI\u2019m under construction. I may have some messy areas, but God\u2019s still working on me.\u201d There are hurting people all around, broken people that think no one cares. God rescued you; He\u2019s counting on you to rescue them. Don't miss this message from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/W0XXdWAcmv You may be in a situation where you\u2019re not being treated fairly. Don\u2019t worry; your time is coming. Circumstances may be against you, but the Most High God is for you. What God has blessed nothing can curse. When you understand this, you won\u2019t go around upset. You\u2019ll know every force that\u2019s trying to stop you is powerless to change the blessing on your life. When you speak life, chains are breaking. When you show love, strongholds are coming down. When you\u2019re merciful, compassionate, kind, you\u2019re pouring oil on the wounds. Be inspired by this message from Joel. Get it here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/0BoZKJSQ7S You\u2019ve been healed; now go help somebody else get healed. You broke that addiction; help somebody else break their addiction. God didn\u2019t heal you just so you could be well. He healed you so you could become a healer. It doesn\u2019t matter who likes you. What matters is that the Most High God likes you. He\u2019s not limited by who\u2019s against you. When He commands the blessing, all the forces of darkness cannot stop Him. God loves messy people. He loves broken people, people that are at a disadvantage. Click here to listen to this important message from Joel on podcast: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/2CjWgz6DHG There\u2019s enough judgment in our world. There\u2019s enough finding fault, criticizing. Where are the healers, the lifters, where are the people that instead of turning away from the hurting, they run to the hurting? Instead of condemning the broken, help heal the broken. Nobody is too far gone. Nobody has made too many mistakes. Sometimes all they need is one person to believe in them, one person to say I\u2019m praying for you, one person to breathe new life back into their spirit. You can run away from God, but God will never run away from you. His grace will come looking for you.  Tune in now to this message from Joel: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/nHAmkWGCX0 People have enough pushing them down, pointing out their faults. You can be the one to push them up, to see the best in them, to help them get free. Other people may not see it, but underneath the dirt, the mess, the bad decisions, there\u2019s a son, there\u2019s a daughter of the Most High God. They may be bound on the outside, but on the inside, they\u2019re a person of destiny. God has freely given you mercy; now freely give it to others. God is counting on us to lift the fallen, to restore the broken, to heal the hurting.\n\nWatch Joel\u2019s message this morning on his Podcast!  https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/3mREotrYDN There are people God has put in our lives, on purpose, so we can help restore them. God didn\u2019t put them there so we could judge them; He put them there so we could love them. Love heals, love restores, love lifts up. Promotion doesn\u2019t come from people; it comes from the Lord. When God is ready to promote you, no person can stop you, no bad break, no disappointment, no delay. When you\u2019ve learned how to rise above the challenges, you\u2019ll be at peace when you should be upset, you\u2019ll have a smile when you could be discouraged. You\u2019re showing God that you trust Him. The favor of God has brought you this far, and the favor of God is going to keep you going. Instead of complaining, thinking about how big your obstacles are, your attitude should be, \u201cLook how big my God is.\u201d Don\u2019t give away your joy to someone you don\u2019t even know. Don\u2019t let a stranger pull you out of rest. You\u2019re not hurting them; it\u2019s souring your day. Check out \"Take Your Seat\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/iOVxmzxYYa The problem with a \u201cone day\u201d mentality is that you\u2019ll miss what God wants to do today. God wants to give you favor right here, right now. If you want to bring a smile to God\u2019s face, if you want to make His day, start approaching Him like you know He loves you, you know He\u2019s for you, you know He\u2019s longing to be good to you. When you\u2019re an eagle, when you\u2019ve learned how to rise above the challenges, you\u2019ll be at peace when you should be upset. You\u2019re showing God that you trust Him. Don't miss \"Take Your Seat\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/ynAYVFaCZp You\u2019re not stuck; you haven\u2019t reached your limits. As you keep honoring God, at the right time, you\u2019re going to go where you couldn\u2019t go before. You\u2019re going to accomplish more than you can imagine. What God has in store for you is going to amaze you. The people He\u2019s going to bring across your path, the influence He\u2019s going to give you, the places He\u2019s going to take you are far better than you can imagine. Jesus defeated every enemy. He\u2019s already paid the price, made the ultimate sacrifice. You\u2019re not working to get the victory; you already have the victory. Be inscpired by this message from Joel, \u201cTake Your Seat\u201d. Get it here: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/PQGnsV6L9w What you\u2019re believing for is not way off in the distance; it\u2019s not years down the road. It\u2019s at hand; it\u2019s close. Live with expectancy. When you live out of a place of rest, all the forces of darkness cannot stop you. God has the final say. It may have been meant for your harm, but instead of being a stumbling block, God is going to turn it into a stepping-stone to take you to the next level. We all face challenges in life; we all have storms. The key is to rise above the turmoil. Don\u2019t let it get on the inside.  Click here to listen to, \"Take Your Seat\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4pL3j https://t.co/NpWfv3qmTw God said He always causes you to triumph. It may not turn out the way you thought or on your timetable, but God\u2019s ways are better than our ways. This is what trust is all about. There are a lot of things in life we can\u2019t change, we can\u2019t change people, but we can change our approach. We can choose to not let things upset us, not go through life worried, frustrated, discouraged. When you try to make everything happen in your own strength, God steps back. As long as you\u2019re working, He\u2019ll rest. But when you rest, God will go to work. Tune in now for a new message from Joel, \"Take Your Seat\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/EyMJwOv0mh God has already defeated every enemy; He\u2019s already planned out your days for good. Take your seat. Live from a place of rest, a place of peace, a place of trust. You\u2019re not going to answer to people about what you did with your life, how you spent your time, or how you used your gifts. You\u2019re going to answer to God. Your destiny is too important to let people control you. People may have done you wrong but you\u2019re not trying to pay them back. You know God is your vindicator, He\u2019ll make your wrongs right. Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast! \"Take Your Seat\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/58sVv0a9hE Work from a place of rest, knowing that God\u2019s favor is on your life. He\u2019s breathing in your direction. Goodness and mercy are chasing you down. The right people, the right opportunities, are already headed your way. Yes, we\u2019ve all made mistakes, but you don\u2019t have to pay God back. The price has already been paid. Receive His forgiveness, receive His mercy. You have enough people in life against you; don\u2019t be against yourself. Don\u2019t stay focused on what you\u2019ve lost. God has a plan even for the broken pieces, the remnants, things that most people would discard. He can use them to take you where He has prepared. Your brokenness can become your breakthrough. Keep an attitude of expectancy, looking for it, believing it\u2019s going to happen. That\u2019s your faith being released. That\u2019s what allows God to do amazing things. It may seem like the end, but it\u2019s a new beginning. You are stronger than you think. God is not going to leave you in that storm.

You haven\u2019t seen your greatest victories. You haven\u2019t sung your best song, danced your best dance, laughed your best laugh. The dreams God has put in your heart, the promises, may be taking longer than you thought. You don\u2019t see any sign of it happening. That\u2019s a test. Keep doing the right thing. Keep being your best. God is in control. He sees your faithfulness.

May God Bless America! https://t.co/TT5qOByGK5 If you\u2019ll stay in faith, all the forces of darkness cannot stop you. When God hears you thanking Him before the answer comes, praising Him while you\u2019re in a drought, declaring His favor when the odds are against you, He\u2019ll make things happen you could never make happen. If you talk defeat, you\u2019re going to have defeat. In the middle of the storm, you need to declare what God promised.

He knew every bad break, every injustice. Your greatest joys, your greatest victories, your greatest accomplishments are still in front of you. Instead of depending on people\u2019s approval, why don\u2019t you go to God and get your approval from Him. Instead of relying on others to encourage you, start encouraging yourself.

Don\u2019t let people talk you out of it. Take steps of faith. God will make things happen that you couldn\u2019t make happen. You have a purpose; you have an assignment. There is a calling on your life, something God has ordained you to accomplish. You\u2019re not just filling up space; you\u2019re a person of destiny.

You can\u2019t embrace the new things God has in store as long as you\u2019re holding on to the old. Don\u2019t waste your time worrying; God\u2019s on the throne.

He\u2019s not asking you to figure it out; He\u2019s asking you to believe. When you believe, God will make things happen that you couldn\u2019t make happen. Congratulations to @nikwallenda and @LijanaWallenda for completing an incredible tightrope walk across Times Square!  A true testament to their faith and determination to accomplish the dream God put in their hearts and to carry on their family\u2019s legacy.  #HighwireLIVE https://t.co/gaqkWbrvGQ Praying for peace and strength for my friends @NikWallenda and @LijanaWallenda as they tightrope across Times Square! #HighwireLIVE Faith is not always going to make sense. What God promised you is not always going to be logical. There will be a battle taking place in your mind between what you see and what you hear. The scripture says, \u201cThe things we see are temporary, but the things we can\u2019t see are eternal.\u201d Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast! \"Your Wings Are Coming\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/Y860KAyeho You weren\u2019t created to go through life struggling, lonely, addicted. God didn\u2019t breathe life into you and crown you with favor, so you could barely get by. He created you to soar, to set new standards, to take new ground, to go further than you\u2019ve imagined. In difficult times, you\u2019re going to be saying something. Don\u2019t talk about how big your challenge is. Talk about how big your God is. Need encouragement? A #NightofHope in Anaheim, CA is just a few days away! \nhttps://t.co/ez7bqiOTaQ \n\nJoin  @JoelOsteen and @VictoriaOsteen for this inspirational night of hope, worship and encouragement! https://t.co/ZPZuQlwJxc God was thinking about you long before you got here. The Scripture says that God chose you before you could choose Him. You didn\u2019t get here on your own. Get your passion back. God didn\u2019t create you to live in a drought, constantly struggling, stuck at one level. That\u2019s not your destiny; that\u2019s temporary. Don\u2019t forget about all the prayers God answered for you. Take time to acknowledge the goodness of God in your life. Check out \"Recognize God's Goodness\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/r22SKaHd37 You may think you\u2019ve made too many mistakes, you missed your chance, but God never gives up on us.  God always gives us another chance. Your mistakes don\u2019t have to cancel your destiny. That problem you think will never turn around; He\u2019s already set up the answer. It\u2019s not a surprise to God. He had the solution before you had the problem. Don\u2019t take it for granted. It didn\u2019t happen by accident; it wasn\u2019t a lucky break. It\u2019s the goodness of God. Don't miss \"Recognize God's Goodness\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/34bG0msN1H When you get in agreement with God, then you will become what He says about you. You will have what He says you have. Living guilty doesn\u2019t do anything productive; it drains you emotionally and physically wears you out. Don\u2019t fall into that trap. Don\u2019t get discouraged because where you are is much smaller than what\u2019s in your spirit.  You have to be faithful with the small before God will trust you with more. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cRecognize God's Goodness\u201d. Get it here:  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/sxhbN7fAcx God said He would give you water without rain; that means God can promote you even though you don\u2019t have the experience. God can heal you without the treatment. God can increase you beyond your paycheck, beyond your education. He\u2019s not limited to your job. He owns it all. Chains are being broken; strongholds are coming down. You are redeemed, you are restored, you are honorable, you are blameless. Shake off the guilt, shake off the accusing voices, and receive the gift of righteousness. Anaheim, CA get ready for a powerful Night of Hope, Friday, July 19 at the @HondaCenter!

Click here to listen to, \"Recognize God's Goodness\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/me6C4kP5Jo The scripture says, \u201cDon\u2019t despise the day of small beginnings.\u201d  You have to be faithful with the small before God will trust you with more. You have to be your best right where you are. Stay faithful; your time is coming. Those times you were discouraged, He made a way. He provided when you didn\u2019t see how. If you\u2019re going to continue to go further, then you need to remember it is the Lord your God that has brought you this far and He is the One that\u2019s going to keep you going. He chose you to succeed; He chose you to go further than those before you. Tune in now to this new message from Joel, \"Recognize God's Goodness\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/nZ401qVT2X Recognize God's goodness in your life. Remember how He led you through the desert, how you met that person, how He brought you out of that problem. It wasn\u2019t a lucky break; it was the Lord your God. When you look back over your life, you\u2019ll see the faithfulness of God, where He promoted you, protected you, healed you, favored you. Don\u2019t take it for granted. It didn\u2019t happen by accident, it wasn\u2019t a lucky break; that\u2019s the goodness of God. You\u2019ve stepped into promotion, good breaks, and opportunity because of who went before you. Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast.  \"Recognize God's Goodness\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/LdtQCDORJ0 The father sets the standard. Set a high standard; that\u2019s your legacy.\u00a0More than your money, more than your success, more than your accomplishments, your values, your principals, what you stand for, that\u2019s being passed down to the next generation. Your mistakes didn\u2019t cancel God\u2019s plan. You\u2019re not that powerful. Get back in the game. God is not finished with you. Whatever you face, remind yourself that you can handle it. Your architect, the Most-High God, designed you with everything you need. He promised that you\u2019ll never face anything you can\u2019t bear. What you\u2019re believing for is not way off in the distance; it\u2019s not years down the road. It\u2019s at hand; it\u2019s close. Live with expectancy. Our architect has taken into account all the weight, all the trouble, all the bad breaks, and He\u2019s given you the strength, the courage, the fortitude to withstand. Check out \"Designed to Withstand\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/kMOFvWt4UH Without being faithful and proving to God that you could be trusted, you wouldn\u2019t be ready for where He\u2019s taking you. You have to be prepared for what God has in store. The Scripture says the things we see are only temporary, but what we hear, what God speaks to us, that\u2019s permanent. If you don\u2019t face the pressure, you\u2019ll never discover who you really are. The higher you go, the more pressure there will be. Don't miss \"Designed to Withstand\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/NxWftR4GAd Quit letting small things ruin your day. These things aren\u2019t going to go away. They are tests we all have to pass. As long as you think it will never work out, that\u2019s going to keep you from the new things God has in store. Start believing again. Just because it hasn\u2019t happened yet doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not going to happen. Don\u2019t believe those lies. It may be uncomfortable, you may have to stretch, but the pressure is not going to stop you. You\u2019re going to discover abilities that you didn\u2019t know you had. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cDesigned to Withstand\u201d. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/1l9L1n2ntf As long as you\u2019re allowing circumstances to determine whether or not you\u2019re going to be happy, then you\u2019re never going to have real victory. You\u2019ve been designed to withstand the winds, designed to outlast the opposition, designed to overcome the injustice, designed to endure until the dream comes to pass. That difficulty didn\u2019t come to stay; it came to pass. Be strong and of good courage, for the Lord your God is with you. Click here to listen to, \"Designed to Withstand\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/Fao1BpKX7S The scripture says, \u201cTake hold of God\u2019s strength.\u201d It will be overwhelming if you don\u2019t remind yourself that this is not a surprise to God. He wouldn\u2019t have allowed it if you couldn\u2019t bear this weight. Since He allowed it, that means you\u2019re well able. Take hold of that strength. You\u2019ll never face a situation that you weren\u2019t designed for. You\u2019ll never face pressure that will cause you to collapse, never face a problem that\u2019s too much, never face a dream where you can\u2019t handle the weight. @hovihats We encourage you to stay in faith. Our team will be praying for you. You can also post your prayer request here: https://t.co/lmqV6cQMoK. -JOM Team God didn\u2019t miscalculate when He designed you. He didn\u2019t forget about the environment you would be in and the conditions you would face. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"Designed to Withstand\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/pDW21kWnhh You have the strength, the endurance, the fortitude, the tenacity you need so that no matter what comes against you, it will not be too much to bear. There are new levels to reach, new giants to conquer, new mountains to climb, new skills to learn. Don\u2019t let it overwhelm you; let it inspire you. God will never let you face more pressure than you can handle. He won\u2019t let more weight come on you than you have the strength to bear. Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast! \"Designed to Withstand\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/g2zB4el10j God has designed you with exactly what you need. You may not be able to see it, but your beams are big enough, your walls are strong enough. You can bear whatever comes your way. Living guilty and condemned doesn\u2019t bring any honor to God. Quit listening to the accusing voices and move forward with your life. The final word says, \"Your latter days will be better than your former days.\" The final word says, \"What God started in your life He will finish.\" Now get in agreement with God. God puts things in your spirit as a seed. If you discount it, say no way that could never happen, then that seed will never take root. But you don\u2019t have to figure out how it\u2019s going to happen. All you have to do is believe. People may have discouraged you, but what He promised is on the way. It may not have happened yet, but He has the final say. Check out \"God Has the Final Say\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/HIjFR4hZis When you announce it, it sets the miracle in motion. Your words have creative power. You give life to your faith by speaking it out. Yes, that obstacle is big, but you have greatness in you. You are anointed, equipped, empowered. Quit being discouraged by what you see, and start being encouraged by what you hear. Forces of darkness are being broken. Any area that you\u2019re not living in victory is not permanent; it\u2019s temporary. The final say is coming.

Click here for details:  https://t.co/eHlOGmcFNh https://t.co/IZCatrCEl2 The critics, the naysayers, are a dime a dozen. Eighty percent will tell you what you can\u2019t do. You have to find the twenty percent that will tell you what you can do. If you\u2019re going to see it come to pass, you have to believe what you hear in your spirit and not what you see with your eyes. You have to walk by faith and not by sight. Sometimes God will wait on purpose, not only so you will know it was His favor, but so no one will be able to deny the goodness of God in your life.  Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cGod Has the Final Say\u201d. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/ndIOtELVGS You can\u2019t bring yesterday\u2019s failures into today and live a life of victory. Let it go. God\u2019s mercy is fresh every morning. There are goals God has put in you, dreams, healing, promotion, restoration. They\u2019re lying dormant. You don\u2019t see how it could happen. You could easily settle there, but those promises are still alive. Start calling them out. Will you stay in faith when God is silent?  Will you wait with a good attitude, thanking God that He has the final say when nothing is changing? Click here to listen to, \"God Has the Final Say\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/Orl62UmGiK Go back to those places where you quit believing and stir your faith up. Who told you it was over? That wasn\u2019t the final word. You\u2019re about to see God show out. There\u2019s a sudden change coming. God is sovereign over your circumstances. That means God reigns over everything that you face. Not just the universe, but He reigns over the sickness. He reigns over your finances, over your children. God hasn\u2019t forgotten about you. What He promised is still on the way. What God started, He\u2019s going to finish. He has the final say. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"God Has the Final Say\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/9WRJJrGX4o Don\u2019t dwell on what seems impossible. Are you spending more time thinking about the problem or the promise? Are you talking more about how big the challenge is or about how big your God is? Don\u2019t let the circumstances talk you out of what God put in your heart. It may seem too late, all the experts may tell you it\u2019s impossible, but God has the final say. When you know God has the final say, you don\u2019t live frustrated, worried, stressed. You stay in peace, knowing that nothing can stop God\u2019s plan. Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast! \"God Has the Final Say\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/JaFnx7j5HJ It\u2019s not over till God says it\u2019s over. Go back and look again. Your story doesn\u2019t end in defeat; it ends in victory. Get your passion back and start believing again. Don't be moved by small things: traffic, people, disappointments, mistakes. Life is too short to let your circumstances determine your joy. If you only invest in people that are at the same level as you, you\u2019ll get stuck.

You can turn your back on Him, but He won\u2019t turn His back on you. Your job is not to respond to what everybody says, to prove to them that you\u2019re right. Your job is to be steadfast, immovable. Let it go. Be still and know that He is God. Get around dreamers, connect with people that are more talented, glean from them. That\u2019s good soil. Don't miss \"The Power of the Soil\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/a89fsApXR8 Don't beat yourself up. Quit reliving all your failures. It\u2019s not too late. God\u2019s mercy is bigger than any mistake. Quit telling yourself all the reasons why it\u2019s never going to happen. That storm may be powerful, but our God is all-powerful. He controls the universe. Start thanking Him that things are changing in your favor. Are you holding on to something God\u2019s asking you to let go of, someone that\u2019s pulling you down, keeping you from your best? That\u2019s limiting your growth.

You\u2019re going to become like the people you continually associate with. If they\u2019re not making you better, if they\u2019re not inspiring you, causing you to grow, then you need to make changes. The people you surround yourself with are extremely important.

You need people in your life that are further along than you, people that have a bigger vision, people that are more experienced. You need to be exposed to new levels so that you can go to new levels. If you\u2019re the smartest one in your group, your group is too small. People, if you allow them, can talk you out of your dreams. You have to set some boundaries.

If you'll put yourself in an environment with friends that challenge and inspire you, with people that push you up, then those seeds will take root, and you will begin to blossom. No person is ever going to be perfect. We all have weaknesses, shortcomings. Rise above it and keep the strife out. You can be the difference maker. Weariness comes to us all, but you don\u2019t have to allow it in. This is a new day. God is breathing new life into your dreams. Dare to take hold of His strength.

You may be in a tough time, but God has something in your future that\u2019s going to cause you to forget what you\u2019ve been through.

God will be as involved in your life as much as you want Him to be. If you keep him in a Sunday morning box, He\u2019ll stay there. But He wants to be so much more than that.

If you can reach your dreams in your own talent, your own strength, your own effort, then you don\u2019t need God. Whatever God put in your heart, go after it. Quit looking at how impossible it is, how long it\u2019s been, what you don\u2019t have. Shake off the disappointments, what didn\u2019t work out, who left you. You have greatness in you.

Thank you for your love and support throughout the years! https://t.co/7ko5fjVOUN The people that stay happy, that don\u2019t fall into discouragement, are the people that rule over their thoughts, the people that keep their hopes up, the people that know God is still on the throne. Too often we\u2019re striving to make things happen, discouraged because it\u2019s taking too long. God is saying, \u201cCome to Me. Ask Me for help. Call on My name and acknowledge Me as your Source.\u201d The process may be uncomfortable, but the purpose is worth it. If you could see where God is going to take you, the favor, the influence, the abundance, the health, the friends, you wouldn\u2019t complain about what you\u2019re going through. God wants us to depend on Him. He wants us to see Him as the Source, to recognize His goodness.  Check out \"God Is Your Source\" on Podcast here:  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/OhmdZ0lPEs Your destiny is too great to waste it with people that are not adding value to your life. You need to pull up some weeds. Get rid of some thorns. Their negativity is contaminating your soil. You won\u2019t run and not be weary if you\u2019re focused on your problems. What causes your strength to be renewed is when you live with expectancy and have hope that God is working in your life. You have to trust God. He can see things you can\u2019t see. He knows what\u2019s best. It\u2019s all a part of His plan to get you prepared, developed, stronger. God knows what you\u2019re going to need. God says restoration is coming, new beginnings are coming, breakthroughs are coming, victory is coming. The pain is only temporary, but the joy will go on forever. Don\u2019t discount the small things. It may seem small, but God knows how to multiply. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cGod Is Your Source\u201d. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/xdNgkLoi3O You are full of gifts, talents, potential, but if you hang around friends that compromise and pull you down, if you\u2019re in an environment with limited mindsets, then you won\u2019t see the growth that you should. When you give in to weariness, you lose your strength. I\u2019m not saying to never feel weariness; it will come. I\u2019m saying, don\u2019t allow it in; that will keep you from your destiny. The resource may have dried up, but the Source is still alive and well. Click here to listen to, \"God Is Your Source\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/wUTdrezS9N God is the Source; He\u2019s the provider. The scripture says, \u201cNo good thing will He withhold because you walk uprightly.\u201d He knows where all the good things are. God wants to help you. He wants to heal you, to free you, to increase you, to take you places that you\u2019ve never dreamed. He\u2019s longing to be good to you. Look to Him as your Source. Are you recognizing the Source? Are you thanking God for every good thing? The more you acknowledge God\u2019s goodness, the more of His goodness you will see. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"God Is Your Source\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/dLk77wu2ZP When you\u2019re in difficult times, do something where God can see your faith. Make plans to get well, make plans to come out of that trouble, make plans for God to show out in your life. When you honor God, you are connected to a supply line that will never run dry. You\u2019re not at the mercy of the economy or who likes you or what your boss does. God has all kinds of resources He can use. It\u2019s easy to look to people as our source or look to our job as our source. God uses people, He uses jobs, He uses contracts, but they are not the source. God is your Source. Don\u2019t let the accuser convince you to live guilty, condemned, thinking you\u2019ve seen your best days. You may have made mistakes, but God is still planning to bring to pass what He promised you. It\u2019s easy to get discouraged. Everyone has disappointments, but if you\u2019ll stay in faith, not get bitter, God is going to bless you in such a way that you don\u2019t remember the pain of the past. Whatever you\u2019re believing for, you need to find some promises. Make a list, put it on your phone, your mirror, your computer, and then, all through the day, remind God what He promised you. Put God in remembrance of what He promised, not what you feel like, not what you deserve, not what a relative said, but what God said. Check out \"You Promised\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/odqeRPlJ57 When you\u2019re discouraged, it\u2019s easy to have an exaggerated view of your problem. Take the pressure off. You\u2019re not the only one facing what you\u2019re up against. People have been where you are. God has brought them out, and He\u2019s going to bring you out. You haven\u2019t made too many mistakes. God\u2019s calling on your life is irrevocable. He doesn\u2019t change His mind because you got off course. He\u2019s not going to leave you alone until you get back on the right path. Take a break from telling God everything that\u2019s wrong. At some point, you need to switch over to thanking Him for what He\u2019s promised. Don't miss \"You Promised\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/Tg0xapu168 Shake off low expectations. Shake off what somebody told you that you can\u2019t do. They don\u2019t determine your destiny; God does. If you\u2019ll be a prisoner of hope, God promises He\u2019ll pay you back twice for the unfair things that have happened. This is your year for double. This is your year for vindication, for restoration, for new beginnings. You\u2019ve got to get your mind going in the right direction. Stay in faith and stay open. It may not happen your way or on your time table, but God is true to His Word. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cYou Promised\u201d. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/rxrktu60y1 Don\u2019t put a question mark where God put a period. We\u2019re not going to understand everything that happens, but God is so amazing, He\u2019s going to cause you to forget the pain of the past. God planned your days for good. He crowned you with favor, He\u2019s directing your steps. The way to honor Him is to go out each day with passion, being your best, pursuing what He put in your heart. Don\u2019t compare your life to other people. Run your race. God\u2019s purpose for your life is not the same as theirs. Don\u2019t look to the left or to the right. Stay focused on your calling. God is not obligated to bring to pass what we say, but He is obligated to bring to pass what He says. When He hears His promises coming out of your mouth, angels go to work, forces of darkness are pushed back, favor is released in a new way. Sometimes we know more about the problem than we do the promise. We spend hours searching the internet, learning everything that could possibly go wrong. Why don\u2019t you spend fifteen minutes and google scriptures about what you\u2019re facing. Faith is not always going to make sense. What God says is not always going to seem logical. If you try to reason it out, check with all the experts, and study all the reports, you\u2019ll miss God\u2019s best. When you start declaring His promises, when you start speaking what He says about you, it\u2019s going to change your perspective. Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast! \"You Promised\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/s5Mxxef8jN When we face difficulties, one of the best things we can do is find a promise in the scripture and remind God what He said about us. Don\u2019t just pray the problem, pray the promises. Do the right thing when it\u2019s hard. Keep a good attitude when people are not treating you right. Go the extra mile when nobody is watching. You may not see anything happening, but you\u2019re getting prepared to go to new levels. Don\u2019t let battle fatigue keep you from your victory. Don\u2019t let weariness stop your dream from coming to pass. You are closer than you think. Don\u2019t be discouraged. God controls the opportunities. As long as you stay in faith and keep honoring Him, He\u2019ll bring the right opportunity to you. When you have a disappointment, have a bigger view. Maybe it didn\u2019t work out because God has something better coming your way. God designed your plan knowing every plot against you. The good news is, His plan will override every plan that was meant to stop you. Check out \"It's a Setup\" on Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/sWCI5F7zEV When it\u2019s your time, no person can stop you, no bad break, no injustice. Just as God hid you, He will bring you out into the open. He\u2019ll shine His light on you and cause you to go where you could not go on your own. You always face the greatest struggle, the greatest opposition, the greatest discouragement, right before the breakthrough, right before the healing, right before you meet the person of your dreams. You have to be so convinced that God is for you that you don\u2019t fall apart when life is against you. Don't miss \"It's a Setup\" from Joel on Podcast!  https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/SEMzeMWQn4 You may be facing a situation that looks impossible, and you could easily let it overwhelm you, but God has given you strength for that battle. He said you would never face something that you couldn\u2019t handle. The silence is not a sign that God is not working. He may not be changing the circumstances, but He is changing us. God uses the seasons of silence to get us prepared. Do the right thing when the wrong thing is happening. Your time is coming. What God has ordained will come to pass. Be inspired by this message from Joel, \u201cIt's a Setup\u201d. Get it here: \u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/cpOzykJ9RR God never runs out of favor. He has unlimited resources. Somebody else being blessed is not going to stop God from blessing you. You don\u2019t have to live worried when negative things happen, try to pay people back, be frustrated because of a disappointment. Stay in peace. God wouldn\u2019t have allowed it if it was going to stop you. On the other side of the difficulty is a new level of your destiny. Nothing is random. If you\u2019ll stay in faith, all things are going to work for your good.  Click here to listen to, \"It's a Setup\u201d: https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/njMfuWMaxp Those people that are coming against you, those negative circumstances, they are pawns in the hand of God. The enemy thinks he\u2019s using them to hold you back; the truth is God is using them to push you forward. No person can stop Him, no crisis, no delay. All the forces of darkness cannot stop what God has purposed for your life. You can\u2019t reach your destiny without opposition, without betrayal, without criticism, without things you don\u2019t understand. Get this encouraging message from Joel, \"It's a Setup\": https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/smIXCnYsIM The Scripture says, \u201cGod has ordered your steps.\u201d It doesn\u2019t say He suggested them: maybe this will happen, maybe that will happen. No. Your steps have been ordered. What God orders will come to pass. When you take up your cross, it doesn\u2019t mean you won't have difficulties, people won\u2019t betray you, you won\u2019t make mistakes. Life will happen. The beauty is that God will give grace, strength, favor, and joy to lift you and sustain you. The God who breathed life into you, the God who numbered your days, the God who is for you is in complete control. Watch Joel\u2019s message this morning on Podcast! \"It's a Setup\": https://t.co/KwNtaNHhCw https://t.co/TbrbYysQHW After all Christ has done, after the incredible price that He paid on the cross, it doesn\u2019t bring Him any honor for us to go around feeling unworthy, condemned. Let\u2019s do our part and believe that we\u2019re forgiven, redeemed, that we have an everlasting release from our sins. We wish you and your family a happy Easter as we celebrate our risen Savior! https://t.co/shrNcMivWa The scripture says, God has already accepted you, He\u2019s already blotted out your sins, He\u2019s already shed His blood. It\u2019s not if He\u2019s going to do it; He\u2019s already done it. The question is will you receive it? What you\u2019re believing for may not have happened yet, it may be taking a long time, but God is a faithful God. He\u2019s not only going to bring it to pass, but God is going to do more than you asked. When Jesus hung on that cross, He took all your mistakes, all your failures, all your weaknesses, every wrong, and He forgave it. Receive the mercy that your Heavenly Father is offering you. If you\u2019ll shake off the guilt and keep moving forward, nobody is going to be able to tell what you\u2019ve been through. Check out Joel's new Podcast here! https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/U95XgrKwr8 You may have done things you\u2019re not proud of. You may think that you\u2019ll always be hindered by your past. Quit listening to the accusing voices. You\u2019re forgiven; you\u2019re redeemed. Now, do your part and put on your robe of honor. Your words can limit your life or they can increase your life. They can curse your future or they can bless your future. What you\u2019re saying in the storm will determine whether you come out of that storm. Talk about how big your God is. It may seem like another routine day, everything looks the same, but God is going to show up and do something out of the ordinary, something that you didn\u2019t see coming, something that will thrust you to a new level. What\u2019s come against you is not permanent. What was meant for harm God is turning to your advantage. Be inspired by this message from Joel:\u00a0https://t.co/spV2a4HmrT https://t.co/p8ANs3PIfx When God laid out the plan for your life, He lined up everything you need to fulfill your destiny: every good break, every person, every solution, every healing. He\u2019s not trying to figure out how to do it; it\u2019s already set up. You don\u2019t have to have favor with everyone; you just need favor with the right one. A dozen people may not like you, but they can\u2019t stop you. God has the right people that will bring opportunities, favor, and promotion. What that challenge took out God is about to put back in. He\u2019s not going to just bring you out, He\u2019s going to make up for what was unfair.
