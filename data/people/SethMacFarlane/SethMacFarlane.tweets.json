We\u2019re seeing the same thing all around the world. Social media as a platform for unedited, unvetted information dispersal free from an obligation to truth has helped propel other Trumps to victory around the globe. https://t.co/OQr6kU0pnP I see BIG differences between Donald Trump and Barack Obama. The rise of social media and the spread of misinformation, in my view, has played a colossal role in the \u201cevolution\u201d of political discourse. I see big differences in the politics of the last 4 years vs. the last 40. https://t.co/OQr6kU0pnP Please read Brooking and Singer\u2019s wonderful book \u201cLikeWar.\u201d It\u2019s a terrific reality check that this platform needs.

Get ready! https://t.co/oObWZVmLoL Repeated studies show that, statistically, social media (where both Left and Right get most of their news) spreads more misinformation, conspiracies, and falsehoods than actual news.
