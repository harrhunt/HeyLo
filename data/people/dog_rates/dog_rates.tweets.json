We will continue to post our Friday GoFundme\u2019s, but by making you all aware of pet health insurance, we hope most of you never need our help \u2764\ufe0f (3/3) While that\u2019s amazing, we\u2019re still sent a heartbreaking amount of fundraising requests every single day. We\u2019ve learned a lot from being the recipient of these stories, and it\u2019s very clear that when your dog has a medical emergency, the costs can be overwhelming. (2/3) We are excited to announce @Trupanion is our official pet health insurance partner.\n\nSince we started posting GoFundMe\u2019s in 2017, you all have raised over $1.3M for dogs needing unexpected surgery or treatment.
