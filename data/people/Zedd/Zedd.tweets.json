I appreciate that.\n\nha, well for me, I spit out my food laughing when I saw @LewisCapaldi's cameo in the video. I absolutely love him and a cameo doesn't get much better than that. @billboarddance @TantrumJas It has. I believe I finished the song in late February but it has been difficult to find an appropriate time to release \"Funny\" given the difficult state the world is in. I believe  music has a healing power and hope that it can help people make their days easier / more happy. @strattacaster Woah!!  \nSmall world!!!! @billboarddance @TantrumJas I think at this point I'm actually quite comfortable in this tempo range. I think the biggest challenge for me was the perfect song structure because the chorus is a double-chorus and I wanted to tease the lyrics in the drop but not reveal the whole lyric line until the bridge. @billboarddance We definitely exaggerated the process in the video. In reality, The Monsters &amp; Strangerz, who wrote the demo with Jasmine, sent it to me and asked if I would wanna work on the record and I produced the song while Jasmine had no clue I was working on it. So the surprise was there.

And if done right, it could be much harder to cheat. @Maybe_Im_Cody Well then you can vote like u used to. This is just an extra option. The idea is to make it EASIER for ELIGABLE people to vote. If you don\u2019t habe a phone you can vote via mail in or in person. @levie Well it\u2019s good to know that IT IS possible. That\u2019s step 1. U would need to build a system where you can register, enter all necessary information (SSD, passport scan and what not) and only then are u allowed to vote. And if you vote, your name is no longer allowed to vote again. I\u2019m no tech expert but is this possible? @levie @ZackTheStiles You only have one name. It you\u2019re eligible and you have voted - you can no longer vote. @robbydthe3rd Your SSN would need to be a attached form it. There would need to be some sort of system in place for it. Of course not as easy as my tweet makes it sound - but I\u2019m absolutely sure it\u2019s possible. @darsh5000 I definitely understand that fear and certainly is a valid point. \nI think if we\u2019re almost ready to go to the moon we can probably figure out a way to make it SAFE. IDEA: \nSend out an Amber Alert out to everyone (qualified to vote) to make it the most convenient, safe and easy for everyone to vote from home. \nIf you don\u2019t want to vote you can click it away, but if you do, it gives you a chance to do so from home with minimal effort. @LuluLuvely HAHAH @LuluLuvely I'm obsessed. @TwoNiickels HUGE W \ud83e\udd23 SAVAGE \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 https://t.co/YxAqZrKX6r @PezRadar Those are pretty good numbers.

Agree w that. @SamitoFPS @emonggtv You nailed the exact issue with OW: the skillgap between noob and pro in this game is so gigantic that the game is either gonna please 95% of normal players or the 5% of top players - but it\u2019ll never please both. \nFor what it\u2019s worth; people just wanna enjoy playing the game @emonggtv OR simply randomized hero bans for each game!\nThe current bans certainly couldn\u2019t possibly more random so might as well make it actually random for each match, requiring more creativity and communication and making it ever surprising and interesting and fair for both teams.

No whataboutism here pls @iamaghostduh No, I believe if you feel uncomfortable talking to strangers, which I can totally understand, maybe you just sloooowly recline, maybe even just look back first to make sure they\u2019re not eating in this moment, and if no feedback, you\u2019re good to go. :)\nIt\u2019s all about communication @dougvansant right. I see where you\u2019re coming from. \nBut just because it\u2019s coming from HIM isn\u2019t giving us permission to claim the correct thing to be wrong. \nI hate trump, very obviously, but if he does something right I won\u2019t argue it\u2019s wrong because it\u2019s coming from him e.g. @NarWhat Punching the seat is just the most absurd thing ever.\nTo me, we must be kind and compassionate.\nIf I wanna recline and a super tall person is behind me and kindly asks not to recline, I will not recline because I will just be in less pain than they would be being so tall. These days I feel like people just try sooo damn hard to only see the bad in people... @c_keen I\u2019m not referring to that dude. THAT of course is not ok ever. I\u2019m referring to DELTA\u2019s CEO who in an interview suggested that he thinks it\u2019s rather correct to ask before reclining. @SachaVibes \ud83e\udd23 \ud83d\udcaf @therealjmers Sure. Then just say to the person behind: \u201cexcuse me, I\u2019m about to recline\u201d just so they know. It\u2019s simple. Nobody said you can\u2019t recline. @ModernMachines That\u2019s a completely different conversation. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a debate here though - I\u2019m just questioning why people are trying to talk bad about about someone who\u2019s simply advocating for kindness and politeness in this instance. It costs everyone nothing @bryant619 Totally fair and I see where you\u2019re coming from. I\u2019m genuinely asking because I\u2019m curious to know peoples thinking. \nWhy not turn around and say \u201chey, I\u2019m gonna recline my seat, just to let you know.\u201d so if they had food or whatever on the table they has a chance to secure it etc I mean... am I missing the point?\nHe says you have every right to recline all you want, but he just suggests to ask / warn first to ensure everyone\u2019s comfort &amp; safety. \nWhat is the trouble and being nice to one another? The fact that someone is being ripped apart for suggesting to simply BE POLITE and warn someone before reclining a seat to accommodate each other\u2019s comfort is just so 2020...\nMy parents raised me to always ask if it\u2019s ok/ a good time to recline in economy, busses, cars etc. @souljimusic Shit is \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 @KDrewMusic @kiloHearts Ohhhh interesting. :).

But that\u2019s just me \u263a\ufe0f.\nI just think that, compared to hero buffs / nerfs, that apply universal for heroes across all maps, an allowed hero ban allows more flexible and adjustable meta for each map. Would be fun :) @FRANA_OW I\u2019m ALL about hero bans. Adds another layer of strategy and variety to the game one could argue got taken away by 2/2/2.\nWell...
