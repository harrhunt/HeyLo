{"tweets": "The path to universal happiness is unknown, but minimising contact with people you dislike is a pretty fu*cking good first step. If you do the same thing for 8 hours a day, that's madness, but if you get paid for it, then it's a job. The brain is a sadist because it forgets that nice dream right away but remembers that cringy thing you did 14 years ago. RT @lapoelkann_: LOVE WINS OVER EVERYTHING \ud83c\udf08 \ud83d\udc99 https://t.co/ryKmPYukVf Humans have concluded that it is easier to colonize Mars than to deal with other humans on earth to make it better Overthinking a is a painful reminder that you care too much, even when you shouldn\u2019t. \u201cShit\u201d is an insult, a compliment, a noun, and an adjective. You\u2019re neither the first nor last person to see your naked body. The world ending in 2021 seems way more believable than it ever did in 2012. That lame \u201cI haven\u2019t see you since last year\u201d joke is going to be true. \"Y'all\" is the ultimate gender-neutral pronoun. Some of the most talented people on the planet have given up on their dreams because they never caught a break or ran out of money to pursue their dreams a little longer. Adulthood is disappointing for many because it doesn't take place in the same era we were children in. 90s children imagined their adulthood taking place in a 90s-like society where the rules remained unchanged. Hearing \"I love you\" hits different than \"I love you too\" RT @lapoelkann_: #Maserati is the first automotive company I worked for. Extremely PROUD to work at this new fase together with my Garage I\u2026 You never really question feeling sad for no reason, but as soon as you're happy for no reason you get suspicious. Memories ruin really good songs. 2004 doesn't seem that long ago until you look at a car from 2004. \"With all due respect\" is the polite version if \"listen here you little shit\". Worst part of being a kid was not having adults take you seriously when you knew what you were talking about. The 15 minutes of extra sleep after you wake up feels like a lot more than the 8 hours of sleep that you just had. Maybe villains monologue their entire plan to the hero because they're lonely and never had anyone to share it with before. It\u2019s super creepy that you spent 1/3 of your life willingly unconscious in a dark room. Every school teaches Physical Education, but no school teaches Mental Health Education. School actually teaches us one of the most used things in life, stress. Having kids is the ultimate example of a free app that takes lots of in-app purchases to succeed. We do not check the refrigerator multiple times to find new food, we check to see if our standards have dropped enough to eat what was available. Finding someone equally as awkward as you can be really exciting. RT @astronomysnaps: https://t.co/NPX9UE3J4V RT @astronomysnaps: https://t.co/LjBogR3MKI Most people hate reading because school ruined it for them. Everybody says \u201cDon\u2019t talk to strangers\u201d but in order to make friends you have to talk to strangers. An electric toothbrush and an escalator are two things that can stop working and still accomplish their original goal. You know you\u2019re not a kid anymore when you start to understand the villain decisions. The difference between an 8 hour shift and a 10 hour shift is way more than 2 hours. Kids believing that adults have things figured out has to be one of the most effective scams in history. When two of your friends meet from different circles it's like a cross over episode. Without a straw, you drink from the top to the bottom. With a straw, you drink from the bottom to the top. There is probably a person out there who would find you perfect in every aspect. Rarely do people want your advice, they want to feel validated and heard. The brain doesn\u2019t even know it exists until it learns it at school. If a crime is only punishable with a fine, then it is a punishment for the poor only. \"Happy 2021\" will probably be the most enthusiastic New year'e Eve celebration yet..

For some reason, \"You ain't shit\" and \"You are shit\" are both perfectly good ways to insult someone. Dogs prepare you for children, while cats train you for teenagers. Depression comes from living in the past, Anxiety comes from living in the future. A problem with being single is that everyone assumes you don't want to be single. Before radios, tvs, and smartphones people never knew there were so many dumb people out there. They just thought it was that one guy in town. The universe isn't \"preparing\" you for anything you're just suffering. When it rains, tall people get wet first. Money doesn't buy happiness, but it can buy safety &amp; security, which is a very expensive precursor to happiness. We are insanely lucky that our digestive system is so quiet. Rich people are paid for the results of their work, but poor people are paid for their duration of work. Some people want you to be a part of their lives without being a part of your life. Giving a hug &amp; receiving a hug are two completely different feelings. High school is basically like a free trial on education and once you graduate they ask for $50,000 if you want to continue. We don\u2019t kill time, time kills us. Toxic family is way way way worse than toxic friends, colleagues and strangers. Someone randomly decides ghosts look like people in blankets and everyone just went along with it. Humans are actually really inefficient, we take about 8 hours to charge for only 16 hours of use. Schools don't test your knowledge, they test your memory. A reason becomes an excuse when it's not good enough. Face masks make it pretty easy to see who uses protection. It is more socially acceptable for men to have \u201cfeminine\u201d bodies than for women to have \u201cmasculine\u201d bodies. However, it is more acceptable for women to have masculine interests than for men to have feminine ones. If dogs actually understood people, they wouldn't like us as much. School doesn\u2019t prepare you for life it prepares you for more school. Saying, \"I understand\" gets a lot better results than, \"I know\". Bisexuals are the omnivores of sexuality. Sex is literally shoving organs together until you\u2019re tired. Children don\u2019t get more disrespectful as they age, they just slowly feel that they are mature enough to express their own feelings and concerns. Just because someone has it worse than you, doesn't invalidate the things you are going through. We can get thousands of idiots to pee on their phones if somebody created a pregnancy test app. When you give someone a compliment or do something kind, you might forget it quickly, but they might remember it for years. You could already have affected many people in positive ways that you don\u2019t remember. The people that laugh at or make fun of people with broken/mispronounced English are the same people who will never be able to speak another language themselves. Society teaches us to make the world a better place for the next generation and then look down on them because of their privilege. Villains probably take so long to explain their evil plan because they have no one to talk to. Smoking actually makes you cooler, since a dead body is colder than a living one. If you're an only child, you have control of whether an entire bloodline dies or not. Since female mosquitoes need our blood to lay their eggs, in a sense we\u2019re all co-parents of a bunch of little mosquitoes. if beer is liquid courage than coffee must be liquid motivation. Humanity\u2019s most impressive survival instinct is the instinct to pull your feet under your blanket to protect yourself from monsters. No one taught you. You never saw others do it. You just knew. We all just knew. Being with people who don't listen is lonelier than being alone. If someone created a women\u2019s clothing line that was just dresses with pockets and jeans with actual pockets they would probably get a lot of business. There is an absurd amount of people that would rather die than admit they were wrong. Closing all you tabs after a long project is such a good feeling. You can pronounce \"drink\" like \"jrink\" your whole life and no one would know. H*ll and F*ck put together make heck, which is considered more family friendly. Putting happy cows on meat and dairy products is actually kind of sadistic. In school we are taught about all the cruelty and backwardness of humans during history. In adult life we then realise that things still are pretty bad. The hardest part of doing something you hate is starting. The hardest part of doing something you love is stopping. One day your childhood ended and nothing was ever as easy and straightforward as sitting eating cereal and watching cartoons on a Saturday morning. A nice thing about getting older is that the world becomes increasingly fu*ked up which makes the idea of leaving it increasingly appealing. A duck only has to meow once for you to question every quack. Less and less people will know how beautiful a clear night sky is. There is a sense of relief when you find out that someone is an asshole in general, and not just towards you. 0 isn't a number , It is a portal that all the numbers that pass through it became negative or positive. You probably know more Latin, a dead language, then you do Mandarin, the most common native tongue. If your significant other starts using your gibberish, you have their heart. People who set multiple alarms have trust issues with themselves. Most of the trash you see on the ground is unhealthy food packaging because people who don\u2019t care about their own health don\u2019t care about the Earth\u2019s either. One of the most frustrating feeling is when the aisles at grocery store you know gets rearranged.. \"It's never too late to start\" is a terrible mindset for procrastinators.. The first caterpillar to turn into a butterfly must have been like YOOOOOO.... I would get off my ass so much more if life had visible EXP bars and levels for all the skillsets I could acquire. You legally have a family, you can legally have a partner and you can legally have children. However you never actually legally have any friends. A person you know from your past remembers a version of yourself that doesn\u2019t exist anymore. It's sad how quickly the age of information turned to the age of wilful ignorance. The boomers were the last generation to have an easier life than their parents. Scooby Doo must be a therapy dog. Shaggy takes him everywhere and Scooby always reacts to Shaggy\u2019s stress. Maybe humans get \"hangry\" because it's their body trying to shift them into hunting mode. If you made $1 every second from birth, you\u2019d be a millionaire in under 2 weeks and a billionaire in your thirties. But unless you live to be 3500 you\u2019ll never be as wealthy as Jeff Bezos. Nobody argues with scientists when they say an eclipse is gonna happen, but as soon as one mentions the planet is getting warmer\u2026 You will enjoy most things until you are forced to do them. So people acting stupid in a zombie movie was a realistic portrayal of human behaviour after all.. Millennials get blamed for participation trophies when the Boomers invented and executed the concept. If you would rate your partner a 10/10, it simplifies into 1, thus you have found the 1 for you. When you buy a bigger bed you have more bed room and less bedroom. Your body is made of cells, which are made of atoms, which are made of quarks and electrons, which are just vibrations in energy field. Your entire existence is based on vibration. You are a vibrator. An \u201cA\u201d is an \u201cH\u201d that gave itself a high five. An \u201cX\u201d is an \u201cH\u201d that tried to give itself a high-five but missed. One of the biggest goals of adulthood is to make enough money to be as carefree as you were when you were a child. You\u2019ve probably passed a pigeon on the street with the same birthday as you. Saying you sold an hour of your life for $15 sounds a lot worse than saying you work for $15 an hour. Replying \u201ck\u201d in morse \u201c-.-\u201d, has the same passive aggressive tone. Yeah sex is cool but have you ever slept without a blanket and woken up to find yourself covered with one. Pizza is an acceptable meal at any time of the day. Marriage is the ultimate co-op game. Someday, no one is going to know shrek even existed. The fear of going into forest at night isn't from fear of being alone, but rather the fear that you aren't. All you need is a certain smell to bring your thoughts back to even your childhood.. Telling a depressed person to be happy bcoz they're loved is like telling someone with asthma to breathe bcoz there's oxygen around them!! Rich people get criticised more for donating a small amount than not donating at all. Animals that have suffered abuse almost never regain the trust of humans, yet we expect people who have been through similar abuse to go about their daily lives normally surrounded by other humans. The reason why you haven\u2019t found your soul mate is because maybe you don\u2019t have a soul. If people one day woke up and became Happy with themselves, imagine how many industries would run out of business. I often go months without finding new music I like, then discover five great songs in one day. Cactus are the most antisocial plant, they grow in the middle of the desert and still like, \u201cDon\u2019t f*cking come near me\u201d. I wish we could just uninstall thoughts from our brain. I remember when the weather was the least trusted part of the news. One-sided compromise is sacrifice. Two-sided sacrifice is compromise. You know you're an adult when you get tired from something that hasn't happened yet. You\u2019ve survived 100% of the things you have ever encountered. You\u2019re nailing it. Congratulations. Life is so boring when you don't have an online order that you're looking forward to receiving. There are Early Birds and Night Owls but no Afternoon Iguanas or something. People who are depressed talk to the voice in their head more than they talk to actual people. Breaking up is like deleting a game you spent lots of time, progress and money on. Your birthday is only your special day if you have friends that make it your special day. Otherwise it\u2019s just a reminder that you don\u2019t have any friends. Doing nothing and doing too much are both considered \u201cnot having a life\u201d The female breast has become such an object of sex that people scold women in public who use them for their real purpose. Adults are still scared of hearing a noise in the night. The difference is they think a person broke into their house, not a monster. A major difference between dogs and cats is that when you take care of a dog, the dog assumes you must be some sort of king, while when you take care of a cat, the cat assumes that it must be some sort of king. When you were a kid, you thought only kids misbehave. When you grow up, you realise adults are worse than kids. Funny how 11 P.M. is considered \u201clate night\u201d but 12 A.M. is considered \u201cmidnight\u201d. It's kind of nice that your body warns you before you sneeze. Humans probably enjoy pets and rubs just as much as dogs, it's just less socially acceptable. Being alive is the only thing you can spend 10,000 hours doing and still have no idea how to do it right. When you give someone a compliment or do something kind, you might forget it quickly, but they might remember it for years. You could already have affected many people in positive ways that you don\u2019t remember. It\u2019s weird how none of the toys in toy story speak Chinese. The weirdest thing about living alone is how many hours you go without speaking a single word. People always tell introverts to be more talkative and leave their comfort zones. yet none tells extroverts to shut up to make the zone comfortable... Your soulmate is out there, but you guys will never meet each other because neither of you like to go out... Your dreams are also life experiences, but they are not canon. Not wanting to work ever is considered \u201cdepression\u201d even though we weren\u2019t naturally born to work a 9-5 job for the rest of our life. It\u2019s weird how every person knows a different version of you. The 21st century skipped over the \u201croaring 20s\u201d decade and went straight into the Great Depression. It's very disturbing that the history we learn isn't 100% true and many interesting moments have been hidden, covered up or changed completely to fit those who pass it down. The [unspoken] hardest part of dating is meeting the perfect person for you. Then having to accept that you might not be the perfect person for them. It's sad that people are more surprised by random kindness than nastiness. \u201cOld McDonald\u201d gets a lot darker when you realise everything is past tense. You're either uglier or more attractive than you think, you can never be sure. The most intelligent part of being smart is knowing when to play dumb. You have only 1 birthday, the rest are congratulations for surviving. We all just fully accept that we have birds that can f*cking talk. If I were a ghost, I would haunt people by knocking on their door as soon as they started mast*rbating. We live in a society that has normalised social media so much that it is an achievement to not have it. It took me 21 years to figure out that when somebody says \u201chold your horses\u201d they\u2019re telling me to be stable. We want eternal youth, not immortality. I wish I went to bed with the same level of tiredness I wake up with. Humans have had the ability to communicate for at least 50,000 years and some of us still can\u2019t even talk to girls. Millennial edition of Monopoly would consist of walking around the board paying rent and never being able to buy anything. \"I hope your day is as pleasant as you are\" can both be an insult or a compliment depending on the person. You have no idea how loud some actions are until you have to perform them with a person sleeping in the same room. At some point in your life. In a room full of people, you were the smartest person in the room... Life is just a really long story about how you died. As a kid I used to brag about how expensive my stuff was, but as an adult I brag about how cheap I got stuff for. Imagine the sound a centipede would make wearing tiny flip-flops on every foot. It\u2019s possible that your sleep paralysis demon is actually working for Monsters Inc. The true message of Jurassic Park is \u201cDon\u2019t piss off your IT person\u201d. If you pick a random rock and take it on a trip with you, it would probably be the most adventurous thing that rock has done in decades. It's weird how when you're depressed, not doing anything feels way more exhausting than actual physical labour. Candles have changed from being used to see, to being used to smell. The Flash would go faster on a bicycle than he would on a motorcycle. A good chunk of people in the 'A Quiet Place' universe probably died believing staying silent was against their freedom of speech. Loving someone is different from being in love with someone. You are probably \u201cthat guy/girl\u201d in someone else\u2019s story. 1 year old pics are memories, 5 year old pics are cringe, and 10 year old pics are nostalgia. You feel worse running on low sleep than no sleep at all.. Some adults wish they were children again, but no one actually wants to be treated like a child. If the past few years have shown us anything, it is that stupidity is contagious. We have all played a vital role in someone's life and don't know it. One benefit from having a pet is that you don't worry about random noises in your house as much. It's difficult to find a comfortable sleeping position when you go to bed at night but when you wake up the next morning, almost any position you move into is comfortable. Mosquitos have zero idea that they are hated by just about every other creature in the animal kingdom... People who believe \"money can't buy happiness\" never had to struggle a day in their lives. There is a possibility that the history book was made from a tree that witnessed the event.. People who sneeze and try to cover their sneezes even while wearing a mask are people you can trust. Nothing hits you like a dog not liking you. That moment between birth and death is so awkward. the reason adults aren\u2019t picky eaters is because they buy food that they like to eat. A chemistry text book is atoms explaining atoms to a bunch of atoms. There\u2019s a tiredness level where every position is comfortable and there\u2019s a tiredness level where no position is comfortable. You really don't understand how dumb most adults are until you become one. The answer to the age old half empty or full glass question: It depends on your last action with it. If you drank from it it's half empty, but if you filled it it's half full. Social anxiety and general awkwardness can come from parents that teach us what not to do in social situations but forget to teach us what to do. Worst part about headaches is that nobody cares until they have one... The reason most people think raising boys is easier than raising girls is that they don't raise their boys. As a child we believe that adults can do anything they want . As an adult we realise that children could do anything they want. As kids, everyone warned us about the dangers of peer pressure but no one warned us about \"superior\" pressure which has way worse and longer lasting consequences. Watching adults yell about their right to not wear a mask feels akin to watching a toddler yell at mom about their right to throw rocks at people. Going to school after a break is like when you pause a video game to go pee and when you come back you forget how intense and chaotic everything was when you paused it and the second you unpause it all your enemies collectively punch you in the face. Dead people receive more flowers than the living ones because regret is stronger than gratitude. Pretending to not understand sarcasm is the greatest form of sarcasm. Obedient dogs are considered smart, but obedient humans are considered dumb. The goal of wearing masks is to not have to wear masks. If you hear weird noises In the night, simply make weirder noises to assert dominance. Kids can\u2019t wait to grow up and Adults wish to become young again. College students however don\u2019t want either and wish to cease being. 12 AM doesn\u2019t feel like the middle of the night anymore but 3 AM does. There's a high probability that someone hates you because someone else lied to them about you. Aren't you sometimes surprised when you type your password in the shittiest/fastest way possible, and it still works. Someone out there has the highest success rate of inserting the usb correctly on their first try... Comedy news shows used to make shit up to be funny, now they just tell the truth. We are taught by society that following the crowd is stupid. Nobody bothers to teach us that doing the opposite of the crowd can be just as stupid. There is no greater moment of empathy and understanding as a man seeing another man get hit in the balls. It would be super cool if after we died we could see a list of all our life stats like how much money we have spent, how much distance traveled, how much food we have eaten, etc... It takes more effort to be normal than it does to be different... In order to fall asleep, first you need to pretend to be asleep.. Your birthday is your personal new year.. Adults disregarding teenager's logic just because they're younger is pretty childish.. Erasers slowly sacrifice their lives because of our mistakes... There\u2019s probably something you\u2019ve done/said in public that someone will remember for the rest of their life. The way you interpret what happens to you probably affects your life just as much, if not more, than what actually happens. There\u2019s only one point in your life that you are the happiest you\u2019ll ever be. You\u2019ve either reached it and it\u2019s behind you or you haven\u2019t reached it yet. And it\u2019s impossible to know. You know that you're antisocial when you get annoyed at your phone ringing before you know who it is. The air in the mornings of field trips hit different. If you close both your eyes, you see black. If you close just one eye, it sees nothing. Kids don\u2019t just dislike vegetables, they dislike the boiled, unseasoned ones they were forced to eat. A white person and a black person are unnecessary labels of the same species. If you lay down with enough force you can fall asleep instantly. You aren't paid according to how hard you work, you are paid according to how hard you are to replace. If you\u2019re ever feeling lonely, remember there are billions of cells in your body and all they care about is you. Best part of the internet is that anyone can use it, worst part of the internet is that anyone can use it... We are more afraid of making grammatical errors in an online argument, than when we're taking english exams in schools or work-related papers.. Ironically, you cannot defeat an irrational person with logic. People with depression sleep a lot because we are trying to reproduce that 'refreshed morning after' feeling &amp; perspective on life that non-depressed people have after having a rough day, but it never comes, so we keep trying. A young photo of you is an old photo of you... We're all just water cooled engines with anxiety. Animals get 20 minutes old and already know what to do.. You can be a night owl AND an early bird if your sleep schedule is messed up enough... People who played sims growing up had the potential to became interior designers or psychopaths. As we get older we don't suddenly stop being afraid of ghosts or the dark, real life just gets a lot more scarier. Saying that women had no place in gaming is false since the queen in chess is the strongest piece Spoons are the kindest eating utensils. When you wash them, they wash you back. You\u2019re the bad guy in someone\u2019s story. Medusa makes men hard. Human life has started to become less about survival, and more about finding ways to pass the time until we die. It feels like summer break but we\u2019re all grounded. A surprisingly big part of being an adult is trying to schedule a time when you can afford to have a mental breakdown. Singing along to your favourite song when it\u2019s playing too loud for you to hear your own voice is a great example of \u201cignorance is bliss\u201d Humanity is smart enough to solve all of its problems, but is too stupid to actually do it. People often forget that between boomers and millennials there is a whole generation that hates them both. If Voldemort was wise enough he'd put one of his horcruxes into a Nokia 3310. We've spent years to make curved monitors flat, just to curve them the other way. The moment you grow up is the moment you start getting more scared from people than monsters when going out at night. We've almost completely flipped from our parents telling us to not believe everything we read on the internet to us telling them not to believe everything they read on the internet. The voice in your head is far more fluent than you will ever be. Family doesn't come first, the people who love you do. The majority of us wouldn't have celebrated on December 31, 2019 if we knew what was in store for next year. The worlds most famous spy is also the worlds worst spy. It's better to wake up from a bad dream and realise it was all in your head than a good dream and realise none of it really happened. If you are dumb and you\u2019re willing to admit you\u2019re dumb, you\u2019re already smarter than the vast majority of dumb people. Eating cubes of cheese makes you elegant, but eating shredded cheese from the bag makes you a savage. If someone asks you something they can easily google, it\u2019s because they want to talk to you. The seats you chose in class can literally change your life.. 13-year-olds are so angry because they've just gone from being the highest-ranking children to the lowest-ranking teenagers. When you start living alone, you begin to realize how long it really takes to use up an entire toothpaste tube. Light bulbs were such a good idea that they became a symbol for a good idea. Some people don't want to hear your opinion they want to hear their opinion coming out of your mouth. When Never Gonna Give You Up randomly plays in your head, you Rick roll yourself. Arguing with a genius is very difficult, but arguing with an idiot is impossible. Everyone wants to be unique while hoping to find a place they can fit in. If your voice sounds so cool in your head imagine how Morgan Freeman's voice sounds in his head.. Out of all the reasons to hate people, skin colour seems the most lazy. Money is never actually yours, it\u2019s just your turn with it. It's amazing how we can entertain ourselves with a bunch of 1s and 0s arranged in the right pattern. For every species that has ever gone extinct, there was a point where there was just one organism remaining. Whether it was for 10 seconds or 20 years, there was a creature that lived a life as the last of its kind. Thinking about working is way worse than actually working. Back before allergies were discovered, people would just randomly drop dead for no reason and nobody knew why. 1 year ago, the most we were worried about was how disappointing the Game of Thrones ending was. Times change. People who are socially anxious aren\u2019t afraid of what other people think about them, they\u2019re afraid of what they THINK other people COULD think about them. A smart person will simply look something up if they're unsure, but a stupid person is rarely unsure. Every morning, Jeff Bezos wakes up and decides to not end world hunger. Accents are font settings for your mouth. The voice in our head is always at the same volume, it's impossible to scream in our head. The thought of \"Wanting to die\" as a whole has being normalised to the point that, when said in public, people might even answer with \"Same\" or \"Me too\" instead of worrying about ones well being. Water actually tastes something, but society decided it didn\u2019t since it\u2019s hard to define its taste. When you wake up your brain has already started deleting the cache memory of your dream. Water is the solution to everything! Thirsty? Drink water. Dry skin? Drink water. Get rid of your enemies? Drown them. Ducks can swim, fly and walk on land. They have access to all terrains. They are the ultimate animal. \"I was having connection issues,\" is the new \"I got stuck in traffic.\" You\u2019re the result of every one of your ancestors being tough enough to survive tens of thousands of generations of very challenging times. The second 3:59 am turns into 4 am late starts being early. You probably have multiple random unregistered world records but just have no idea what they are. It\u2019s not selfish to do whatever makes you happy because if you aren\u2019t happy you\u2019re prone to lashing out on others which is worse than being selfish. 6am-2pm goes by a whole lot faster than 2pm-10pm. Good grammar is important, but the message itself is importanter. You know that some shit went down on a TV show when the end credit scene that is normally filled with music is eerily silent. Bachelor/Bachelorette parties would make more sense right after a divorce rather that right before marriage. Schools are the reason why kids think that Monday is the start of the week instead of Sunday. We give people prison sentences longer than a human lifespan on the off chance we catch an immortal dude. Putting on dirty glasses is weird because you can see better but also worse. You're an adult when having \"nothing to do\" is more of a blessing than a curse. Being awake is exhausting. The gist of the dating app problem is: \"Women get attention they don't want; Men want attention they don't get.\" If someone says they made food with \"a lot of love\", it's butter and garlic. The word \"Owl\" is an \"OwO\" peeking behind a wall. Feeling mentally-exhausted feels more exhausting than feeling physically-exhausted. We globally decided that the opposite of vanilla is chocolate. One day, your whole life will just be nostalgia. If humans have different blood types do mosquitoes see us as different flavours? You may be the first immortal human and not know it. \"At least you've got your health\" never felt like it included mental health. Kids think adults have their shit together. Untill they are adults and see that almost nobody has their shit together, but almost everyone is good at hiding that. Everyone's personality is a sum of defence mechanisms they have adopted to survive any situation. Everyone acts brave, until the cockroach starts flying. Despite all the jokes, it turned out none of us had 20 20 vision... The dragonfruit is the \"super hot girl with no personality\" of the fruit world. What if rainbows came out at night and glowed like neon lights? I am always in a rush to get home to do absolutely nothing... We're all peer pressured into wearing clothes. Maybe schools don\u2019t teach you how to manage your finances, despite it being an important life skill, because a large part of the economy (predatory credit card companies, consultants, insurance) relies on you not knowing enough about it. Considering how many people are more tired during the day and more awake at night, maybe humans were meant to be nocturnal. Essential oils are ironically one of the most unnecessary products to buy. A big problem with the majority of society is that as soon as the media stops covering a story they believe that issue is over.

People aren\u2019t nearly thankful enough that spiders don\u2019t have wings. Not calling fries and ketchup \"tomatoes and potatoes\" is a missed opportunity. The word \u201cDude\u201d is gender neutral. Because I\u2019m a dude. He\u2019s a dude. She\u2019s a dude. We\u2019re all dudes. Maybe when you're sleep deprived you aren't hallucinating, your brain just loses the ability to filter out everything around you and rationalise it all. If you\u2019re driving a Tesla and it get stolen, is it now an \u201cEdison\u201d? We dress our best to convince other people to get naked with us. If mosquitoes evolved to consume fat instead of blood, they\u2019d be the most popular creatures on the planet. Maybe the sound of rain is relaxing because an ancient part of our brain knows that predators aren\u2019t out hunting while it\u2019s raining. Somewhere among the 7.6 billion of us there\u2019s an oldest living virgin. I wonder how many times in my life I have thought \u201cI\u2019ll always remember this,\u201d that I have now completely forgotten about.

Just like bacteria aren't aware of our existence, there could be giants around us that we cannot see cause we are too tiny to make sense of them. Do a*sholes watch movies and think the asshole characters are reasonable people? After enough years of saying 2016 sucked, 2017 sucked, 2018 sucked, and so on, it\u2019s starting to look like maybe things just suck. You are hearing this sentence with your eyes. There are people who won't believe people landed on the moon but will believe that Bill Gates has microchips to go in our bloodstreams to track us with no power source If everyone would feel (mentally and physically) the exact pain they cause to another person the world would we a so much better place. I'm terrified for 2022. The sequel is always worse than the the original. The scariest f**king thing is hearing a crunch when eating something that doesn't crunch. We're living through events that look like something straight out of a history textbook. Getting a package in the mail is more fun than buying it at the store because you get to open the package like a present. Music is the closest thing we have to mind control. It makes people move, changes moods, and can also bring back memories. It seems like the entire planet is screaming \"I need an adult!\", but there don't seem to be any. If being a \u201cmoody teenager\u201d wasn\u2019t so stereotyped then teenagers might feel more comfortable talking about mental health. EAT becomes FAT if you don\u2019t draw the line. We never realise how skinny we are at a point in time until we get fatter and look back at our older pictures. Introverts need time to recover from social interaction because they\u2019ve been acting all day. Too many people live their lives like Chess, always planning 12 steps ahead &amp; trying to \u201cwin\u201d. But life is more like Tetris, You can only ever know what\u2019s immediately coming next &amp; try to not die for as long as possible. Millennials are the most educated, but least paid generation ever. Knowing that you don't know is a form of intelligence. If you had the power of teleportation, you could start a really good delivery business. If Bruce Wayne's company went bankrupt, Batman would lose his \"super powers.\" Your parents told you to go to bed early when you were young not because you were tired, because they were tired of you. No one cares how good you are, but everyone cares how bad you did. The Simpsons did not predict the future. It's just that our reality is becoming so ridiculous it looks like a satire cartoon. You can be a night owl AND an early bird if your sleep schedule's fu*ked enough. I wonder how many people I\u2019ve said \u201cSee you later!\u201d to and then never saw again. I probably have more conversations with hypothetical people in my head every day than I have with actual people. As I get older, birthday parties are less about presents and more about presence.

The reason so many geniuses come from ancient times is because back then, they had nothing better to do than study their subject. Skype had a 17 year head start... and still lost. Imagination is weird. You see stuff but it is not in front of you nor do you see it with your eyes. You just see the image, in your head, without \"seeing\" it. And you are fine with it. Cassette tapes had a side A and a side B, it\u2019s only logical that the CD was their successor. Sneezing with a mask on feels like shitting your pants with your face. I\u2019ve never been told when to do my taxes, how, or why. I have never been explained what taxes are, but If I get it wrong, I go to jail. Can a ghost and a zombie come from the same person? What if phobias are made from how you died in a past life. Best example for \"You either die a hero or live long enough to see your self become a villain\" is PLASTIC. Throwing knives are a stupid weapon because if you miss or don\u2019t incapacitate your opponent all you did is give them a knife. The shower is the only place I don\u2019t use technology, which is probably why I am able to think so clearly. People that wear glasses stare at glass all day.

We don\u2019t technically \u201cchoose\u201d friends, we just accidentally stumble upon them in life. When asked \u201cwhere do you see yourself in 5 years\u201d, everybody in 2015 probably got the answer wrong. going to bed at 4 am somehow feels better than waking up at 4 am. Juice taste better when you stand there and drink it with the refrigerator door open. We\u2019re so used to everyone being rude, that kindness is suspicious.

What if, when you die, you find yourself in an alien body, holding a bong, around a bunch of aliens and asking you \u201cSo how was it?\u201d I\u2019ve gotten out of bed every day for 18 years. That\u2019s 6,570 sit-ups and I don\u2019t have one ab to show for it. If we saw souls instead of bodies, our definition of beauty perfection and our world would be so different. If you could see all mental illnesses like you can with physical ones, they'd be taken more seriously. I would get off my ass so much more if life had visible EXP bars and levels for all the skillsets I could acquire. Cactus are the most antisocial plant, they grow in the middle of the desert and still like, \u201cDon\u2019t f*cking come near me\u201d. I wish we could just uninstall thoughts from our brain. Nutritional labels should include a \u201cWhat if I ate the whole damn thing\u201d section. Spiderman would be a lot less cool if he didn\u2019t live in New York.

Being proactive is rarely rewarded, because if your actions avoid a tragedy, there is no tragedy to prove your actions were warranted.

All pleasures are guilty pleasures if you have a high enough anxiety. Your title changes because other people had sex. Such as Grandmother, Grandfather, Aunt, Uncle. We live in a generation where robots are named Sophia and kids are named X \u00c6 A-12 Introverts don\u2019t make new friends, they just get adopted by extroverts!! When someone asks you to do something you were just about to do, it makes you want to do it less!! Any distance is walking distance if you\u2019re broke enough. Best thing about dogs is you can act like something good happened and they will celebrate. They\u2019re always ready to party no matter what! English teachers out there waiting for schools to re open so they can give students an essay topic \"How I spent my lockdown\". Breaking up is like deleting a game you spent lots of time, progress and money on. It's funny how \"I love you\" can be taken platonically, but \"I like you\" will almost always be taken as a confession of love. How do our brains remember that we forgot something but can\u2019t remember what that thing was. Some people are not an early bird or a night owl\u2026 they are a permanently exhausted pigeon. If you made $180,000 a day since the birth of christ. Jeff Bezos would still have more money than you.

Money may not make you happy, but it sure as hell removes all the extra stress that comes with being broke while unhappy. Not pausing your music when you take off your headphones makes you feel like you're wasting the music. A college class is like Dora the Explorer. The professor asks a question, stares blankly for a few seconds, then answers his own question. People with anxiety are basically way too aware of being alive. The less seriously you take yourself on the internet, the more fun you have. Long ago a wolf explained to his son, \"Eat a man and you'll be fed for a day. Whimper and roll over and play dead, and he'll feed you for a lifetime.\" Earth travels 1.6 million miles per day. Yesterday\u2019s problems are literally 1.6 million miles away.

Here, take some nice neurotransmitters for that\u201d 2018, 2019, and 2020 are like a movie trilogy that just gets weirder with each instalment. Someone had a crush on you was totally secretly in love with you, dreamed about you at night &amp; you have no idea. Since dogs can\u2019t take acting lessons, anytime a dog is happy in a movie it was also happy in real life. It sucks when you're really good at something that you don't like doing. We never really actually grow up. We just decide how to pretend in public and that becomes our personality. You spend most of your child and teen years being told how precious your youth is and not to waste it but also given very little power over how to spend your time. Have you ever wondered how many fictional characters you\u2019ve absorbed into your personality. This generation is so used to depression that its become a source of humour. When someone accuses you of being lazy, it\u2019s almost always because you aren\u2019t doing something they want you to do; so it\u2019s a shaming tactic rather than constructive criticism.

If you have a look to the human genital anatomy, you may think it would actually make more sense for girls to wear pants and for guys to wear skirts. The last normal day we had was Friday the 13th If practice makes perfect, how come waking up in the morning never gets any easier. Sleep is the best body's safety mechanism. It keeps you from screwing things up for 8 hours! You know you are an adult when you get excited to just go home. Some men complain that women never go for the \"nice guy\", but those men don't hit on women based on how nice the woman is either. You could have been in some kind of pain your whole life, and thought it was normal. Giving a hug &amp; receiving a hug are two completely different feelings..

Cheese is neglected milk. A lot of guys don't know how to take compliments only because they get them so rarely. A bachelor party makes more sense after a divorce instead of before a wedding. Anxiety is our brain sending our body fake news. I hate the idea of doing homework more than actually doing it. The people who have the most screwed up lives often give the best advice. Growing up I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019m actually not that nice a person, but I just act nice because I\u2019m afraid of the consequences of saying/doing what\u2019s on my mind. I used to think I was in a bad mood but it\u2019s been a couple of years now so I guess this is just who I am now. I don\u2019t dislike mornings. I dislike being woken up and having to do a bunch of stuff right after. People who wear pyjamas in public have either given up on life or are living it to the fullest. The human brain is awesome , it functions 24 hours a day from the day we are born and only stops when we are taking an exam or fall in love. People don\u2019t know you - they know a version of you in their mind and everyone has a different version of you. Looking for a relationship when you\u2019re lonely is like grocery shopping when you\u2019re hungry. It\u2019s easy to be tempted to bring home unfulfilling, unhealthy junk. Reading \u201c!!!!!\u201d is like trying to scream with no mouth. Celebrities need us more than we need them. Having an anxiety disorder is like having that \u201cfeeling in the pit of your stomach that something isn\u2019t quite right\u201d just before something bad happens, except you feel it constantly. Nothing fu*ks you up more than your own thoughts. It would be great if your body could store sleep hours, like sleep for 16 hours, then you could stay up for two days without getting tired.

There is someone on Earth who you would have a f**king unbelievable time with, but you will never meet. Enjoying music is genuinely one of the greatest things about being human. Dates are just interviews for sex. Insults only hurt when you already believe what they\u2019re saying. When you\u2019re dead, you won\u2019t even know that you\u2019re dead. It\u2019s a pain only felt by others. Same thing when you\u2019re stupid. Having the ability to fall asleep instantly would improve many people's lives. Ironically jogging pants are worn by the laziest people. A big part of becoming an adult is realising nobody gives a crap if you wear the same pants two (or more) days in a row. I wonder what human being number I am. Society hates a lazy person, until that lazy person becomes so lazy that they discover a very efficient way to do something. I wish my desire to sleep during the day and my inability to sleep at night would trade places. *Has Cough*\nFriend:  It's Coronavirus..\nDoctor: It's common cold...\nGoogle: Lung Cancer, You'll die in 3 days!!! https://t.co/8VZfa3yoBl Being able to tolerate the sound of your own voice in a video is probably the highest form of self acceptance.

If you can't look back at your younger self and realize that you were an idiot, you are probably still an idiot. The only reason we grow out of childhood fears like monsters and the dark is because we get real things to be scared of like taxes and dying alone. It\u2019s incredibly likely that there are at least some 10/10 gorgeous people out there in the world who would date you. What\u2019s even more likely is that you\u2019ll never meet one of them. The cow doesn't give us the milk. We take it from the cow. Humans like to sleep when it's raining, because of a primal instinct of safety, since no predators are going on a hunt while it's raining.

The first dent, scratch, or crack to an item is always devastating, but after that, the heavy burden of keeping that device in pristine condition is lifted and feels so much better. Everyone hates being sung happy birthday, and everyone hates singing happy birthday, so what the heck are we doing here. Why is it that you can hold a pee for 3+ hours but not the 3 seconds it takes to take off your pants? The human race should take a three year break from making babies and sort some shit out. As you get older, your birthday goes from a huge celebration to a mild inconvenience. Every t-shirt I\u2019ve ever bought is a future pajama top. Every time I read any variation of \u201c2 hours later\u201d it\u2019s in a french accent. Thanks SpongeBob. If age taught me one thing it is : Days are long, years are short. Every time I see the cat staring at \u201cnothing\u201d on the ceiling I have to prepare myself for two possibilities: bug or demon. You hate your alarm both when it works and when it doesn\u2019t. Imagine the life and body you could have if you just had some discipline. \u201cThey\u2019re coming for you.\u201d And \u201cnobody\u2019s coming for you.\u201d can both be very menacing threats. It\u2019s weird to think that nighttime is the natural state of the universe and daytime is only caused by a nearby, radiating ball of flame. Dogs hear us talk all day, but if they bark for more than a minute we tell them to stop. I wonder how many people there are out there who I would get along amazingly with but will never meet.

Looney Toons doesn\u2019t get enough credit for introducing countless children to classical music. We\u2019ve done more for the environment by doing absolutely nothing than we have in years. It\u2019s possible that writers with depression have come up with awe inspiring ideas and written the book entirely in their head, but their depression kept them from having the motivation to bring it to reality. And suddenly it\u2019s socially acceptable to cross the street to avoid another person. Commas, are, reading, speed, bumps \u201cStay safe\u201d is the new \u201cGoodbye\u201d Your adult personality is your child personality filtered through society. If you hear birds chirping before the sun\u2019s out, you\u2019re either ultra productive or you\u2019ve lost control of your life. When a cat falls asleep in your lap it\u2019s not a display of trust as we believe it to be. It\u2019s the ultimate display of dominance; for they know we will not move until they allow it. Going out to eat is SO last year. Breaking up is like deleting a game you spent lots of time, progress and money on. We are living through an event that our children/grandchildren will likely read about in history books. Robin Hood is literally a man who\u2019s Robbin\u2019 while wearing a hood. Our definition of \u201cessential worker\u201d is very rarely reflected in what they\u2019re paid. Cats and dogs get along much better than we were led to believe as children. Breakfast can\u2019t be skipped, only delayed. You spend your childhood trying to get your own bedroom and you spend your adulthood trying to find someone to share it with. As everyone who\u2019s pulled an all nighter knows, as soon as that first bird makes a noise, it instantly becomes day. Looks like we are going to miss Summer because some folks don\u2019t want to miss Spring. That \u201cSee you on Monday\u201d turned into \u201cSee you in June\u201d. 2019 wasn\u2019t so bad. The society could practically be on the brink of extinction and the banks would still be charging interest and late fees. We officially have three days of the week \n1.Yesterday\n2. Today\n3.

Quarantine made me realise that I have no real hobbies besides going out to eat and spend money. This march has been the longest year of my life. https://t.co/gUhWksAFfK Being part of a major historical event sucks. A lot of people are going to realise that the world still goes on without them going to work. I miss cancelling plans with my friends :( Humanity clicked on a link from an unknown email address. When quarantine is over don't ask me if I am free.. just say when and where. Anxiety about potentially having shortness of breath gives you shortness of breath. We thought we were going into the roaring 20s but instead we just got the great depression 2.0 Now I know why dogs get excited so to go for walks. This quarantine has taught me to reply everyone. If college wasn\u2019t so expensive maybe we would have more medical professionals available. We can all agree 2020 has been pretty sh*t so far.\nBut remember starting in April it will be 4/20 for an entire month. Quarantine has really shown me that I am, at all times, simply waiting to eat my next meal. I don't know who needs to hear this, but today is Wednesday. Feels like we\u2019re stuck on Sunday. I\u2019d have preferred zombies, at least you can see that sh*t. It\u2019s times like these when you truly realize how useless celebrities are and how essential your average grocery and health care worker is. Every house has a smell that only people living in the house don\u2019t smell. If a person stops to ask themselves if they\u2019re a bad person because of what they did in the past, chances are they are just a good person who made some mistakes. It\u2019s scary how your body can replicate the feeling of falling from high altitudes in nightmares when you\u2019ve never fallen like that before. We all owe 2019 an apology for what we said about it. My adult years have made me question why anyone would go big when they could go home. All of a sudden parents are ok with us sitting down and staring at a screen for a few hours straight. 4am feels totally different when you have to wake up at 4am versus when you been up all night past 4am. I\u2019ll never understand why some people feel their kids owe them something. The kid didn\u2019t bring itself into this crazy world. A human came out of a human because a human came into a human. Do you ever get that sudden outburst of motivation to go out and make your life better then after 5 minutes you\u2019re like \u201c yeah that\u2019s not happenin\u201d George Washington died in 1799, the first Dinosaur fossil was discovered in 1824. George Washington never knew Dinosaurs existed. Having anxiety/low self-worth is comparable to being trapped inside an abusive relationship with yourself. Clearing your throat at a public place in order to get attention has gotten 10 times more effective. Telling someone \u201cYou need to get out more\u201d just became a totally different insult. This is the closest thing to a summer break adults will ever get. Everyone today be acting like the people in our math books. Your 150 millionth grandfather was a fish.

All this technology and we still can\u2019t copy and paste from a pdf. Underwear is weird. I am currently wearing, underneath my pants, a smaller, secret pair of pants that only I know what they look like. If you\u2019re one of those public speakers that say \u201cGoodmorning\u2026.Oh come on we can do better than that, GOODMORNING\u201d I automatically do not like you from that moment on. At 29, I realised today that sweatbands on your wrists are to wipe your forehead not because your wrists get really sweaty. We get angry when the person we're talking to doesn't follow the script we gave them in our head. Looking for a job is about convincing a bunch of Mr. Krabs that you're a Spongebob when you're actually a Patrick, until you slowly become Squidward. Do you ever just crave to someone\u2019s presence, like you would literally be happy sitting next to them in silence and appreciating their existence. People who run out of shampoo and conditioner at the same time must really have their shit together. It is weird how the same people who once played a main or side character in your life can suddenly become mere surprise guests. Somebody somewhere hates you so much because of how someone described you to them. If money wasn\u2019t a so prevalent factor in the equation of life, more people would do what they truly love and it would make Earth an overall better place to live in. Parents worry about what their sons download and worry about what their daughters upload. No one says \u201cwith all due respect\u201d unless they know they\u2019re about to deliver an epic smack down. If you count, your lips don't touch until you reach 1 million. Falling back asleep is easiest when it\u2019s time to get up. Doing nothing all day seems nice until you\u2019ve actually done nothing all day and then wish you had.

The internet isn\u2019t full of stupid people. The WORLD is. The internet is just the proof. Sleeping is best enjoyed in an ice cold room with plenty of blankets. All dogs go to heaven, even though they don\u2019t go to a doggy church or worship a doggy deity. They go because they\u2019re good, and that\u2019s enough. If electric eels went extinct 1000 years ago we'd probably think they were just folklore. The main reason it becomes \u201charder\u201d to make new friends as you get older is that you get really good at spotting red flags in people you meet. We try to go to bed early, so we can wake up early, to get to work early. We try to leave work early if we can, so we can make dinner early, all so we can die early from stress related diseases. Maybe late isn't so bad. Imagine how amazing a rave in an Ikea would be, like a giant house party in all the fake rooms. Somehow it\u2019s socially acceptable to put another person\u2019s genitals in your mouth, but eat ONE Skittle off the floor and you\u2019re \u201cgross\u201d. A stranger will remember you years from now because of some throwaway line you used in a brief conversation, and probably tells that story multiple times in his/her lifetime about you. But you\u2019ll never know that. When you have to study, tidying up the house suddenly becomes the best decision you took in your life. You will never know what memories you lost. The only two satisfying ways to eat popcorn is like a horse or like a lizard. Somewhere, there\u2019s a person who recalls something brave or wise that you said or did and thinks of you as someone who really has their shit together. Imagine a fish coming into your living room wearing a mask and watching you eat breakfast. That\u2019s what snorkeling is to them you sick weirdo. Social anxiety is basically conspiracy theories about yourself. Being a Millenial is like joining a game of Monopoly when every property already has a hotel on it. Older music wasn\u2019t better the bad stuff just wasn\u2019t remembered. Need to get new shampoo. The worst moment ever is when you realise that you\u2019re the one who was wrong in the middle of an argument. Your future self may be thinking about you at this very moment in time. Your dog has no idea that they\u2019re the main reason for the walk. People who voluntarily take parenting classes are not the people who need to take parenting classes. Maybe the Mayan world-ending prediction in 2012 was more of a suggestion. If Apple ever made a car they would probably have oddly sized/shaped cup holders just so people would buy their custom drink containers. When you\u2019re in 1st Grade, 6th Graders looked like adults. Then when you\u2019re in 7th Grade, seniors look like adults. Then you\u2019re a senior and you realise you\u2019re still a kid. One day, you will either wake up and never go to sleep again, or go to sleep and never wake up again. High school is basically like a free trial on education and once you graduate they ask for $50,000 if you want to continue. 3 AM is \u201ca late night\u201d. 5 AM is an \u201cearly morning\u201d. 4 AM is where you just stare at the clock and try to categorise it but you can\u2019t. Going to the movies alone is considered odd when it\u2019s actually the perfect activity to do alone. If your friends tell you not to give in to peer pressure and you don\u2019t, technically, you did. It's crazy how you can be the same age as someone, but at a completely different stage in your life. A therapy dog is essentially just a regular dog who passed a program and has an \u201cOfficial Good Boy\u201d license. Giving a hug and receiving a hug are two completely different feelings. Sleeping in your own bed after being gone for a while is one of the most satisfying things in the world. No woman wearing a dress with pockets will fail to mention that it has pockets upon receiving a compliment on said dress. Being an adult is like carrying a huge ball of laundry, you think you\u2019ve got everything under control until you look back and see all of your socks scattered across the floor. We're lucky we can't control and be productive in our dreams, otherwise our culture would have us studying/working 20 hours a day. Microwaves and humans both say \"mmmm\" when you give them food. It's hard to let someone know that they're bad at taking criticism. You know you are an adult when you get excited to just go home. Your body knows how to do almost everything you learn in biology class about the human body, it just doesn't tell you. If someone is cheating on their significant other to be with you, they will have no problem with cheating on you. We miss the nineties so much because that was the last decade before the rise of social media and cellphones. Since then, our lives have been spent online and they seem to move faster and faster every year. No matter how synchronised synchronised swimmers are, they\u2019ll never be as synchronised as someone that keeps unlocking the car door for you to get in and you keep pulling the handle at the same time. The Powerpuff girls get their power from Chemical X, as in the X Chromosome. Their power is girl power. You don\u2019t realize how long a minute is until you start doing planks. You also don\u2019t realize how fast a minute is until you\u2019re waiting for your next set. Sleep is the body\u2019s best safety mechanism. It keeps you from screwing things up for 8 hours. You can accidentally make a human being but you can\u2019t accidentally bake a cake. The generation complaining about millennials not working are the ones not hiring them. If humans didn't have 10 fingers there's a good chance we wouldn't use base 10 for our numbering system. As a kid a wiggling tooth is exciting. As an adult a wiggling tooth is terrifying. If we do live in a simulation, maybe magic did exist during the dark ages, but it was patched out by the devs. If a pet has stayed with you their full life, then from their point of view you have always existed and will always exist. If we successfully colonize Mars, then Earth will have its first true competitor for Miss Universe. So many heroes would have been dead if the villain just did less talking. \"Noted\" is the respectful corporate version of \"Whatever\" Your current partner will be either the most important person at your wedding or not even present. A lot of people that park like an asshole aren\u2019t actually assholes, they just parked next to an asshole who then left. People who sleep naked don\u2019t have any fear of emergencies.

Adulthood is like losing your mom in the grocery store for the rest of your life. The only thing separating you from certain death at 65mph is a painted white line and a mutual agreement to not play bumper cars. When someone accuses you of being lazy, it\u2019s almost always because you aren\u2019t doing something they want you to do; so it\u2019s a shaming tactic rather than constructive criticism. It would be cool to have a movie shot by 2 directors and 2 versions released showing the protagonists and antagonists story. Admitting that you are wrong is the same as acknowledging that you learned something. Sometimes being a known as a \u201cgood kid\u201d growing up meant you weren\u2019t very good at being a kid. Maybe ghosts DO exist, but they\u2019re all out exploring jungles or mountains, instead of haunting people in boring houses.

If chickens are ever able to tell the story of their species, humans are gonna look like the most evil villains in history. When the person you\u2019re dating asks \u201cWhat are we?\u201d it\u2019s like the free trial period has expired and you have to decide whether or not to get a subscription. A person that does something dumb becomes cute if you like them. There are people out there you haven\u2019t met yet who will love you. We would all be happier if we believed the good things people say about us instead of the bad things we think about ourselves. As an adult, truly realising that \u201cyou can do whatever you want\u201d is the most inspiring and terrifying thing in the world. We spend 20 years of our life learning, to work for next 40 years so that we can afford to live out the next 20 years. The most unrealistic part of any superhero show is the part where the super hero can hold down a 9-5 job, stay out late, and function properly on almost no sleep. Sleep is such a weird concept. You lie there with your eyes closed doing nothing, then all of the sudden your mind just stops, but you have no memory of when this happens when you wake up.. Procrastinating is just enjoying all of the side quests of life while delaying the real mission at hand. Maybe crickets have the exact opposite sense of humor to us, so whenever you hear crickets after a bad joke it\u2019s just your tiny fan club absolutely dying with laughter. Working in groups in school was never meant to teach you teamwork. It was meant to teach you the incompetence of your co-workers. You can turn your ordinary sofa into a sofa bed simply by forgetting your wife\u2019s birthday. As a kid you think adults are these very serious people, then you grow up and realise everyone's just a big kid trapped in a system. We don't teach kids how to learn, we teach them how to pass. An onion is the bass player of food. You would probably not enjoy it solo, but you\u2019d miss it if it wasn\u2019t there. You never realize just how well you can impersonate yourself until you're struggling with depression. Clothes that are not dirty enough to go to the laundry but not quite clean for the closet, go to the chair. Friends are like bananas. If you peel their skin and eat them, they die. If humans suddenly lost the ability to tell lies, the world would be in flames in a matter of hours. There is nothing more relaxing than going to bed at night and knowing that your schedule is free the next day. If you get a girl home and she\u2019s wearing matching underwear, it wasn't your idea to have sex. If you go to jail for tax evasion, you\u2019re living off taxes because you didn\u2019t pay taxes. Peoples mental state would be a lot different if they remembered all the times they made people laugh instead of all the times they failed. Your younger self is your older version. Depression feels like being tired of a long days work even though you\u2019ve been home doing nothing. The biggest injustice in this miserable life is the fact that exhaustion stacks up but sleep doesn't. People are more depressed now because they can do nothing and still be able to survived. Back in the day they had no other choice to do something in order to survive. Lack of purpose is a big factor in happiness. Somebody heard snoring and thought, \"Yeah, that's the letter Z.\" Humans invented machines to skip some effort and now go to gym to make up for the skipped effort. We humans are weird. We run everywhere in video games because we're too lazy to walk, but In real life we walk everywhere because we're too lazy to run. The reason Ouija boards say \u201cDon\u2019t play alone.\u201d is because if you did, nothing would happen. Punishment for honesty is what makes us lie. Depression is like wanting to go home but already being there. You spend your entire life waiting for something. You're always free to do whatever you want until you're told you're not. Isn\u2019t it weird how we basically have an endless mental conversation with ourselves.

Men tell their daughters and sisters not to talk to strangers but get upset when women who don\u2019t know them don\u2019t want to talk to them. I get more motivated by the phrase \u201cF**k it\u201d than any other motivational phrase The word \"quiet\" is often said very loud. Being a teenager, you suffer from both the consequences of \u201cYou\u2019re just a kid\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re a grown adult\u201d We had to destroy the environment to get to the technological level to understand we were destroying the environment. Buying used silverware doesn't seem pleasant but using restaurant silverware that has been used hundreds of times by different people seems completely fine and normal.

There should be two shuffle modes. One for songs you play frequently, and one for songs you haven\u2019t heard in a while. My true soul-mate and I will probably be to shy to say hello to each other. Do you ever get that sudden outburst of motivation to go out and make your life better then after 5 minutes you\u2019re like \u201c yeah that\u2019s not happening\u201d A human came out of a human because a human came into a human. 4am feels totally different when you have to wake up at 4am versus when you been up all night past 4am. People who are rude to retail workers should be punished by having to work in retail for a week. I love talking to small children. No adult is ever going to ask me what my third favourite dinosaur is. If someone else has an awkward moment, I\u2019ll forget about it almost immediately. But if I have an awkward moment, I think about it constantly for years. I\u2019ll never understand why some people feel their kids owe them something. The kid didn\u2019t bring itself into this crazy world. Being depressed when you otherwise have a nice life feels a lot the same like having a full pack of cigarettes and no lighter. My adult years have made me question why anyone would go big when they could go home. A \"lap\" is a non-existent body part that imaginably exists only when you are sitting. We don\u2019t give enough credit to our ancestors for figuring out what we can and cannot eat safely. They are the real heroes. Everybody wants you to work hard, but nobody wants to hear about how hard you work. We should have a holiday like the Purge, but instead of killing people customer service employees are allowed to say whatever they want to customers.

If you marry the right person, for the rest of your life you\u2019ll be \u201cdoing what you love.\u201d Websites telling me I\u2019m using adblocker is a bit like a vampire at the window: \u201cI notice you\u2019ve got your windows locked\u2026\u201d I hope after I die I get to see my stats like, number of breaths taken, number of good deeds, number of house flies killed with my bare hands. The world has become so competitive now. If you share your troubles with someone, they start sharing their own to prove that your troubles are nothing compared to theirs, instead of just sympathizing. Attractive people probably think that everyone is a lot more friendly than they really are. Your funeral is the one thing you will attend and miss simultaneously. No wonder cats and dogs hate each other. One wags their tail when they're excited, the other when annoyed. It's all a huge misunderstanding. Buying erasers is literally paying for your mistakes. Demanding respect because you are older is a form of participation trophy. Everybody is gangsta until the cockroach starts flying. Somewhere someone on this earth needs a person just like you in their life, and they\u2019re always wishing for you to show up. \u201cSurviving high school\u201d now has a whole new meaning. You don\u2019t realise what a terrible singer you are until you\u2019re singing at the top of your lungs and the music suddenly stops or skips and you\u2019re forced to listen to yourself carrying a note that you have no business singing. If you suddenly realise that you're dumb, you're now less dumber than the time just before realisation. Being a baby must be traumatizing at times. Imagine going to sleep in your house and you wake up at Target. One day you\u2019ll stop being asked what you want to be when you grow up, and instead be asked what you wanted to be.

It\u2019s so insane that no matter how weird your dream is, they seem completely normal when you\u2019re in them. Like, you could be riding a giant chicken and it\u2019d be totally normal. The reason why moms always know where everything is is because they're the ones moving our things all the time. People spend billions on movies about saving the world but no one spends billions on real life saving the world. Some people think they're better than you because they grew up richer. Some people think they're better than you because they grew up poorer. Meeting new people is great because you haven\u2019t done/said anything cringy around them yet. Sleeping is the only way to not feel pain or depression. Driving the speed limit on a 1-lane road may be the easiest way to make enemies without doing anything wrong. Minty is just cold spicy. Smarter people are more depressed because they see how the world really is, not what it is made out to be. For a procrastinator, deadlines are both the most stressful, and the most helpful thing in life. Best advice you can get going into adulthood is don\u2019t trust anyone who talks down to janitors, trashmen, maids etc. What idiot named it hereditary depression instead of blue genes.

We\u2019re lucky that our bodies require sleep, otherwise our cultures would have us working 16-20 hour days. Doing nothing all day seems nice until you\u2019ve actually done nothing all day and then wish you had. History would be the most interesting subject in school if they taught just how raunchy, and violent, History really is. Imagine a new episode of Game of Thrones every time you went to class. Adulthood is having the \"there's food at the house\" talk with yourself. Bananas are always emitting ethylene gas which makes other fruit ripen quicker, but they also grow in bunches. Each bunch of bananas is a battle royale to see who can kill the others fastest. Travel size toothpastes last way longer than they have any right to. Ironically, being a food source for humans is probably the single most effective way for an animal to ensure the perpetual survival of their species. As a kid, the thought of living in a huge house was magical. As an adult, the thought of living in a huge house causes anxiety about the cleaning required. Somewhere in the world is a tree exactly your age. Part of growing up is learning to say \u201cf**k off\u201d in nicer ways every year Humans have terrible battery life. 8 hours of charging, 16 hours of use. It\u2019s funny how drinking 8 cups of water a day seems impossible but 7 beers and 5 shots in two hours goes down like a fat kid on a seesaw. You will never know what memories you lost. Once you hit a certain age, life is pretty much a list of chores you keep repeating till you die. If marriage licenses had to be renewed periodically like all other licenses, not only would divorcing be a lot cleaner, but spouses might be discouraged from taking each other for granted. Colleges make you take \u201ccore classes\u201d unrelated to your subject so they can milk two more years of tuition out of you. Once you know how to read, you can't stop reading.

Having someone's phone number memorized nowadays is a lot more significant sign of your relationship's strength/intimacy than it was 10 years ago 4\u00b0 looks like a guy who's having a hard time pooping. Before you start at a new job, everyone hears a new hire is coming in and hopes it's someone hot... then you show up. Every decision you\u2019ve ever made in your life, has led you to this exact moment where you\u2019re reading a pointless post, simply for entertainment. When you set an alarm at 2:00 am for 7:00 am and your phone says \"alarm set for 5 hours from now\" it is unnecessary salt on the wound.

People\u2019s voices get suddenly annoying the instant you know they\u2019re a toxic or bad person. The only thing that bottled water companies actually produce is plastic. Sometimes, the only reason people buy new clothes is to have higher chances of taking them off. Kissing is dismissed by teenagers as the tamest thing to do, and refused by prostitutes as being the most intimate thing to do. Weddings are an expensive way to let your entire family know you are fu**ing that night. Life is very unforgiving for anyone who messes up ages 13-21. Human dating seems pretty similar to looking in the fridge, not seeing anything, then looking again in 2 minutes. Every time we lower our standards and hoping something new looks good enough.

Every time it rains, there's someone really sad that their plans had to be cancelled, and there's someone really glad that their plans had to be cancelled. Spider-Man is lucky he got the desirable traits of a spider like climbing walls and spinning webs instead of having eight legs or eating bugs. If all the ants in the world decided to fight humans then each person would have to fight 1 millions ants. We as a population somehow universally decided on mint as being the taste of fresh breath. Losing weight is more of a mental challenge than a physical challenge. Ending a relationship after a fight is basically a rage quit. Somehow playing video games is one of the least sexy things a guy can do but one of the most sexy things a girl can do. As an adult, any \u201cfree time\u201d you have is actually just you procrastinating something. Too many adults demand respect from kids without showing any in return. Nobody remembers the cringe stuff you did because they are too busy thinking about the cringe stuff they did. Dogs or cats without clothes are technically nude. Therefore, if someone asks you to send nudes, sending them a dog or cat pic is completely legit. The older you get, the smaller the gift, but the more expensive they become. You will never be as young as any photo of yourself. 'They aren't even trying' can be used as an insult and a compliment. Sleep is a free trial of dying. For the first 18 years of your life, your body is under warranty. If you get broken, the people who made you have to pay for repairs. Despite there being 8 billion people in the world, people will still pressure you into having kids as if you're trying to repopulate the Earth after a near-extinction level event. When you look in to a mirror you are watching yourself watch yourself. Your bed is 10x more comfortable when you're not supposed to be in it. The most comfortable position in bed is discovered just before I\u2019ve realized I forgot to set the alarm or plug in my phone. When I\u2019m at a friend\u2019s house I have no problem with helping them do the dishes, but when I\u2019m home, there is literally nothing else I hate more, than doing them. I cannot fight with people, because my mind is constantly coming with counterarguments to my own arguments. It\u2019s pretty ironic that the internet was created to save time. Sometimes I just need a hug with no questions asked. There are people confident enough to be the first to start clapping in a crowd. Snakes either have a really long tail, or a really long neck. An Apple an year makes your money disappear. We are living fine without something that in the future probably will be considered essential. Growing up depressed feels so normal that when you\u2019re having a good time,you feel out of place. Dogs often get given the exact same meal every single day, and yet they never appreciate it any less Someone somewhere might be silently chuckling to themselves at a comment you made three years ago. Whenever you have a good dream reality becomes the nightmare. Odds are you didn't get away with your lie, someone just didn't feel like calling your bullshit. If all the photoshop, makeup and filters didn\u2019t exist. Everyone\u2019s standards will be lower and everyone will be 10x sexier. If a dog could use a computer he'd likely have his owner as his desktop background. The man who started the tradition of men not planning weddings was a genius. If it wasn't already used for photography, \"Selfie\" would also make a great term for masturbation. Your face is a combination of thousands of years worth of other people\u2019s faces. You've spent hours of your life rubbing a piece of glass. The generation that blames video games is the same generation that invented them. Never laugh at your partner's choices. You are one of them. Think of the most attractive person you know. Even that person, at some point, has had raging diarrhea. How fucked would it be if the last sentence of the last Harry Potter book was \"And then Harry woke up back in his bed under the staircase\" We live in a time where its faster to play a game with a complete stranger online than set up a couch co-op game with a friend. You are someone's reason for choosing a different username. The weird, artsy, loner usually gets the girl in movies (instead of the jock) simply because many movies are written by weird, artsy, loners. Monopoly would be more realistic if the person with the most money got to change the rules whenever they liked. Telling a dangerously overweight person not to lose weight because they're beautiful is like telling an alcoholic not to stop drinking because they're fun. Being an adult is eating the crust not because you like it, but because you paid for it. Your balls probably think you have over a hundred children by now.
