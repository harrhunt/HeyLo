Being an adult is basically a \u201cchoose your own adventure\u201d book, but every choice sounds terrible. There are different versions of you living within the minds of others.

Humans spend the first 18 (or more) years of their lives getting caught up to speed about what the other humans have been doing for the past few thousand years. One minute of Elon Musks income would set an average worker for life. Reading is just staring at marked slices of wood for hours while hallucinating vividly.

I wonder how many great books and songs were never released because the writer wasn\u2019t brave enough to show them to anyone. in English why does the letter C exist? a soft C sounds like an S and a hard C sounds like a K.

One of the most validating feelings in the world is being liked by a friend's pet who \"doesn't like ANYONE!\" Applying for a job is more stressful than the job itself.

Anxious people often don't respond to emails/texts not because they forget to reply, but because remembering to respond is *the* reason it takes so long.

Being in a relationship has been romanticised so much in our society, that people perceive single folks as lonely and sad. Losing an argument when you are right just because the other person is too stupid to understand what you\u2019re saying is probably one of the most infuriating things EVER. Remember in the \u201990s there used to be a room in your house that was called the \u201ccomputer room\u201d. English can be weird. It can be understood through tough thorough thought, though.

When you\u2019re criticised for being short, they\u2019re really just saying the worst thing about you is that there isn\u2019t more of you. I wonder if birds on my feeder are friends or if it\u2019s like a public bathroom and no one makes eye contact. Confidence isn\u2019t \u201cI know she likes me\u201d, confidence is \u201cI\u2019ll be okay whether she likes me or not.\u201d Does a cat have 9 midlife crises or just 1 during their fifth life?

If I can make a few people smile or laugh by saying some dumb stuff on the Internet, then that\u2019s good enough for me. Most people treat depression as if the depressed person sat down in a room, weighed out the pros and cons, and decided being depressed was a great option. You know you\u2019ve become an adult when you realise that sleep is a reward not a punishment. Yelling at a dog to stop barking doesn\u2019t work. The dog probably just thinks, \u201cAwesome, now we\u2019re both barking!\u201d The teacher first tells you the importance of a 7+ hour sleep. Then they gives you assignments that keep you up for the next seven nights. By saying \"without any further ado\" you just further adoed a little. People are trying to go to Mars while there are still plenty of people who don't have access to water. Harry Potter is way too emotionally stable for a kid raised by a family who hates him. Most of the people live their lives like Chess, always planning twelve steps ahead &amp; trying to \u201cwin\u201d. But life is more like Tetris. You can only ever know what\u2019s immediately coming next and try to not die for as long as possible. We work five days a week for the luxury of laying down for two. We shouldn\u2019t be so hard on ourselves by saying \u201cprevious generations lived through world wars, the depression, etc.\u201d Minimising social contact is still very hard in a different way. They named it \u201cHigh School\u201d then told us not to do drugs. A black cat crossing your path is actually good luck on account of you get to see a cat. Everybody\u2019s favourite dinosaur is dead. Introverts spend more time thinking about conversing than actually conversing. Yeah sex is cool but have you ever slept without a blanket and woken up to find yourself covered with one. Some people are not an early bird or a night owl. They are just permanently exhausted pigeon. When looking at the stars, you become the unique, final resting place for billions of photons that travelled thousands of light years only to make your life a little brighter. All clothing is unisex if you have the guts to wear it, much like your success in life. A college class is like Dora the Explorer. The professor asks a question, stares blankly for a few seconds, then answers his own question. 2015 feels like last week, but last week feels like 6 years ago. Nobody can insult you like a child can. Not because they are malicious, but because they are honest and very observant. If you don\u2019t look back on your past self and cringe, then you didn\u2019t grow as a person. Understanding that you are stupid is a sign of intelligence. The dark side of empathy is being disappointed in people\u2019s actions because you think they knew better. The date 1/20/21 is a palindrome, even if you write it as 1/20/2021. Growing up is realising that the bottom bunk of a bunk bed is the superior choice. The difference between being a genius and being crazy is the volume at which you talk to yourself. Depression is just being bullied by yourself. Younger people will never know the embarrassing horror of dropping your phone and having the back cover and battery fly across the room. Most people's handwriting show that doing something mindlessly a million times over does not yield improvement unless you actively try to improve. \u201cLife\u2019s too short\u201d is usually used to justify doing something that will probably make it shorter. The first 18 years of your life is not representative of how the rest will go. The sooner you realise this, the better off you\u2019ll be. With various things in life, I either find myself giving too many f*cks or no f*cks at all. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t find a middle ground for moderate f*ck distribution Confident stupidity is more powerful than timid genius. Life is a try not to kill yourself challenge. Does anyone else have a box in your house full of \u201cmystery cords.\u201d Cords that you have no idea what they do or what they are for, but you are too scared to throw them out just in case they are important . If you hear weird noises In the night, simply make weirder noises to assert dominance The first wave of lock down babies are coming. It\u2019s not your money, it\u2019s just your turn to play with it. As a child I was excited when the door bell rang\u2026as an adult I pretend I\u2019m not home. As I get older, I\u2019ve realised that part of being an adult is being tired all the time and trying to find different ways to deal with it. A song can either remind you how long 3 minutes is or how short 3 minutes is. \"You're not alone, millions of people suffer from depression\" is really more upsetting than reassuring sometimes. Future generations studying history will likely have to study tweets. It seems that no one notices what you do, until you no longer do it. Parents are bad at raising teens because they only planned so far ahead to have babies/children. Nobody plans to have teenagers. 85 is divisible by 17...eww... When you cry your brain releases an endorphin to reduce pain and better your mood. This is like the chemical equivalent of your own brain patting you on the back and saying \u201ceverything\u2019s gonna be okay.\u201d It\u2019s better to be alone in your room than to feel lonely in a group. Men think they want a lot of sex until they meet a women that wants a lot of sex. 2021 feels like when you think you\u2019re finally done doing the dishes but turn around and there\u2019s another dish to wash. And another one. And another one. Self deprecating humour is great until someone else joins in. Arguing with smart people is hard, but arguing with stupid people is impossible. One advantage of being a women is that no one can surprise you with a kid years later and say that you\u2019re the Mom. Being open to admitting that you\u2019re wrong is one of the most undervalued personality traits. When you get older, your body is more like a car. When it hurts, you just ignore it hoping it will go away, just like the check engine light. Somebody out there is living your dream life and hates it. Boys will STAY boys if we do not teach them to be accountable men. People don\u2019t realize how much bigger 1 billion is than 1 million. 1 million seconds equal to 11 days whereas 1 billion seconds equal to 31.5 years. It\u2019s f**ked up that when you have low self-esteem, other people liking you makes you question their judgement. Bad memory is useful when you want to rewatch a movie or show when a sequel comes out. RT @Andst7: He would have been proud of you @elonmusk #SergioTheSweatherman https://t.co/pParC5vxh0 You know you are an adult when you get excited to just go home.

There is no physical evidence to say that today is Tuesday we all just have to trust that someone has kept count since the first one ever. Sleep is the body\u2019s best safety mechanism. It keeps you from screwing things up for 8 hours. The problem with stupid people isn't they aren't intelligent , it's that they are confident. A period is like a person tearing down their party decorations in a rage because no one came. Homophobia is gay because you spend time thinking about what other people do with their penises.

You\u2019re probably constantly worrying about the next part of your life without realising that you\u2019re right in the middle of what you used to look forward to. It\u2019s hard to be a new you when you\u2019re surrounded by people that know the old you. The biggest secret parents keep from their kids is that no one actually has any idea what\u2019s going on and everyone is just making it up as they go along. January is just a really long Monday. 2:22:22 on February 22, 2222 will be the biggest and shortest celebration ever (one second long). (2/22/2222 2:22:22) Be thankful to all the emergency service workers, hospital staff, and military who are giving up spending the new year with friends and family to protect and serve your community/country. Happy new year! Instead of kissing at midnight on December 31st, we should do group hugs. The last thing people should feel going into the new year is alone. If people have new month's resolutions, instead of new year's resolutions, they would probably find it much easier to stick with them and feel good about themselves. You know you've grown older when you don't give a f*ck about new year anymore. People treat new year like some sort of life changing event. If your life sucked yesterday it's probably gonna suck tomorrow. If you\u2019re angry you\u2019re in the \u201cfriend zone\u201d, you were not a friend. It\u2019s very possible that, unbeknownst to you, one small ordinary decision you made once was the difference between life and death. In depression your brain refuses to produce the happy hormone as a reward for your brain cells for doing what they're supposed to do. And your cells go on strike, refusing to work for no pay, and the whole system goes crashing down for the benefit of absolutely nobody involved. Growing up is getting more excited about the gifts you are giving rather than the gifts you are receiving in Christmas There\u2019s a big difference between getting up at 6 a.m. to go to work and getting up at 6 a.m. to sit by the fire with a hot cup of coffee while everyone else is sleeping. Being an adult is eating the crust not because you like it, but because you paid for it. Most shit parents will be forever unaware that they were actually shit. In a world where everyone lies, being honest is a socially awkward thing to do. Dogs live in the moment on a level that we humans could never achieve. And they\u2019re content with it. They get in the car and don\u2019t know if the next destination is the dog park, the vet, or a 5 hour road trip. They\u2019re just happy to be included. Human languages are a perfect example of someone making up shit and everyone going along with it People need to stop thinking a number change at the last digit of the year has any impact on any thing. Music was better when people who weren\u2019t good looking were also allowed to make it. A joy of growing up is the realisation that you get far more happiness seeing your loved ones open presents than you do opening your own You are hearing this sentence with your eyes. RT @Andst7: I couldn\u2019t ask for more: my family, my girlfriend and my friends. My thoughts and prayers are with whom is suffering. God doesn\u2026 Nutritional labels should include a \u201cWhat if I ate the whole damn thing\u201d section. Parents are more likely to believe something said by a random guy they've never seen before than something said by their kids they've known for years. 2021 might be the first year that people don't accidentally put the wrong year when writing dates in January. The worst part about realising how lonely you are is when you realise you have no one to tell how lonely you are. Opening the fridge every 5 minutes not because I expect there will be something new in there, but if my standards has lowered enough to eat what\u2019s left. The worst feeling is when you really lack sleep and try to take a nap, and in the end wasted 1 hour trying to sleep. Most people treat depression as if the depressed person sat down in a room, weighed out the pros and cons, and decided being depressed was a great option. You know you\u2019re an introvert when you have inside jokes with yourself. We still live in a world where people think alcohol isn\u2019t a drug. Being an adult is just hiding how immature you actually are from other adults doing the same thing. The best part about being an introvert is all the money you save by not doing social interactions. So many people are in love, but not together. So many people are together, but not in love. If you think about it, birthdays are really satanic rituals about chanting around a flaming object that represents the amount of years taken off your life, upon which the flames are blown out and a knife is stabbed through it. \ud83d\ude02 Women spend an average of 6 years of their lives bleeding but are still stereotyped as not being able to handle blood. If the female orgasm was required to become pregnant, we wouldn\u2019t be currently facing a population problem. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to remind yourself that as an adult, you\u2019re free to just do whatever you want. There might be consequences, but you can still do it. Our society constantly approves morning persons for being productive and positive, but forgets that numerous night workers work so hard that they keep our mornings in an orderly state. You're living the memories of your future self. Adults seemed way adultier when we were little kids. Being able to get up in the morning and work on your own schedule is one of the most liberating things you will ever do. Your brain is a selfish. It encourages you to consume substances that makes it feel good but hurts other organs. Life is meaningless the same way a blank sheet of paper is meaningless. You have to create the meaning. One day you will be a memory for many people. Do your best to be a good one : ) We have normalized having mental illnesses but we haven\u2019t normalized getting treatment for it. I have made all my worst mistakes stone cold sober and after considerable thought. Today i went To The toilet without my phone and there 112 tiles in the bathroom. Always help someone, you might be the only one who does. I wonder if dogs think it\u2019s unfair that we get to bark all the time, but tell them to shut up when they try to get a word in. Every cell in your body is replaced every 7-10 years. The average friendship lasts 7 years. Maybe you stopped being that person's friend because you're both literally different people from when you met and decided to be friends. When I turned 10, I realised how dumb everything I said as a young child was. When I turned 20, I realised how dumb everything I said in my teens was. Now I\u2019m realising why old people don\u2019t talk much. It sucks when I read read as read and not read, so I have to re-read read as read so I can read read correctly and it can make sense!! Ever wondered how many people have masturb*ted thinking of you? The reason I\u2019m good at talking to people who are down on themselves is because I tell them everything I\u2019ve wanted to be told myself. It\u2019s awkward to be a critical thinker at a family gathering full of people who unquestioningly believe dumb shit. Life is a try not to kill yourself challenge.. What if rocks only get hard when you touch them. The last time I was someone\u2019s type, I was donating blood. A good way to know if someone is attracted to you is to realize it years later in a wave of flashbacks and regret. The reason I want to get ahead in life is so that I can be lazy once and for all. What if our dreams are just alternate universes of ourself and every night we catch a glimpse of what is happening to ourselves in that universe. What if every dog is reincarnated into another dog after they die and whenever you see a person walking their dog who goes crazy and tries to meet you and be your best friend is really your childhood dog trying to tell you he knows you and misses you? You\u2019re the bad guy in somebody\u2019s story. Sleeping is nice because you\u2019re not actually dead and you\u2019re not awake. So it\u2019s a win-win situation. I think my generation is slowly going through the stages of grief over realisation that we\u2019re losing the future we were promised. My day is backwards. I wake up tired and go to bed wide awake. Somewhere in the world, you are in the background of a random photo. I wonder how many moments I\u2019ve forgotten when I said \u201cI\u2019ll never forget this moment\u201d. Periods are inconvenient. We should be like turtles: one day a year we go to the beach and drop off our eggs, then everyone goes for margaritas. Do dogs ever wonder why we don\u2019t lick them back? One of the hardest things for humans to do is understand their own emotions but somehow we are going to program robots with emotional intelligence. Every home has a smell that you can\u2019t smell when it\u2019s your home. Isn\u2019t it amazing how one tiny egg, and one tiny sperm can come together and turn into a colossal twat? A compliment from a stranger is more impactful and touching than a compliment from someone you know. Surprisingly huge part of being an adult is trying to schedule a time when you can afford to have a mental breakdown. Money might not equal happiness, but a lack of money causes instability in life which causes anxiety and depression, the opposite of happiness. What if our phobias are what killed us in our past lives? Mental health should be advertised just as much as physical health. Millennial are the most educated, but least paid generation ever. A lot of people find you attractive, but they're too shy to tell you More people would enjoy reading if education didn't force you to write an essay on every book. Breaking up is like deleting a game you spent lots of time, progress and money on. After thousands of years spent on earth, it's pretty baffling that we still need to tell each other that it's ok to make mistakes, to cry and to basically be human. The education system still regards intelligence as the ability to memorise things in a society that has rendered memorisation nearly useless with technology.

Alcohol is interesting\u2026.you drink it to celebrate, you drink it to mourn. You drink it when you\u2019re happy, and also when you\u2019re sad. You drink it to remember the good times, and you drink it to forget. The smartest people don't know much information, they just know where to look it up when they need it. The cold side of a pillow is always just the right amount of cold. You don\u2019t have to solve your whole life overnight. And you don\u2019t have to feel ashamed for being where you are. All you have to focus on is one small thing you can do today to get closer to where you want to be. Slowly and lightly, one step at a time. You can get there. Everyone hates being sung happy birthday, and everyone hates singing happy birthday, so what the fu*k are we doing here. \u201cReal\u201d adulthood is choosing between 2 equally wrong options, and telling yourself that you made the right decision. Real growth starts when you\u2019re tired of your own shit. Everyone went through that phase where buttered toast was the tastiest food on the planet. Onions are the only vegetables that fight back. Humans can only see a certain spectrum of colours, so the feeling that we\u2019re being watched might be because there are creatures all around us that we can\u2019t see. It's funny how we think of prehistoric times in full color but think of 1940 in black and white. When you look up at night, you are seeing exactly the same moon as the first cavemen who ever looked up at the night sky, and every human being since then. You\u2019re probably constantly worrying about the next part of your life without realizing that you\u2019re right in the middle of what you used to look forward to It's crazy that you gotta pay to live on a planet you were born on.

Asexual people can have soulmates. Soulmates do not require sexual attractiveness. We're raised to fear failure so much that a lot of people don't even attempt to do things they could've been great at, meaning we may have skipped on the \"next\" Einstein, Beethoven or Mandela multiple times over. \"Stay safe\" is the new \"See you later\" Anxiety keeps us alive, but it prevents us from living. In your 20s you\u2019re worried about what everyone thinks of you. In your 30s you make it a point to not care what anyone thinks of you. In your 40s you realize that no one was thinking about you anyway. There would be a lot less babies if women had to orgasm in order to conceive. Having a pet is a great excuse for talking to yourself. What doesn\u2019t kill you gives you a lot of unhealthy coping mechanisms and a really dark sense of humor. The best thing about dogs is you can act like something good happened and they\u2019ll celebrate. They\u2019re always ready to party no matter what! Your favourite song always seems to sound worse when you are sharing it with someone. People who admit fault are a lot more trustworthy than people who always think they're right. There's probably a stranger out there that remembers you just because you were nice to them when they had a bad day. People who make \u201chow to\u201d videos are honestly the greatest contributors to society autocorrect is that kid in class who very confidently yells out wrong answers It\u2019s weird that anyone can have a kid, but to adopt you have to be a pillar of the community. Every night, we all allow our brain to paralyse our bodies &amp; give us vivid hallucinations that either torture or entertain us at random until it decides to let us go... Learning about sex by watching porn is like learning to drive by watching Fast and Furious. Confidence is not \"they will like me\" - it's \"I'll be fine if they don't\" If being a \u201cmoody teenager\u201d wasn\u2019t so stereotyped then teenagers might feel more comfortable talking about mental health. Send a wedding invite to every billionaire you can find an address for, as there\u2019s a good chance their assistants just send you a gift without ever confirming who you are or if their boss knows you.

You know you\u2019ve become an adult when you realise that sleep is a reward not a punishment. Mostly no one except you remembers the cringey situations you torture yourself with at night. No matter how old you are, Tom and Jerry will always bring back childhood memories. It feels better trying to warm yourself with a blanket in a cold room than being in a warm room. Being depressed is like being in an emotionally abusive relationship with yourself. The reason most of us stay up late is because we don\u2019t want our free time to end and tomorrow to start... Looking for a relationship when you\u2019re lonely is like grocery shopping when you\u2019re hungry. It\u2019s easy to be tempted to bring home unfulfilling, unhealthy junk. It sucks to realise you are finally getting old and there is nothing you can do to stop it. Reading \u201c!!!!!\u201d is like trying to scream with no mouth.

People who are in therapy talk about the things they went through because of people who need therapy. People who take naps are the real heroes. It takes courage to wake up twice in one day. Having an anxiety disorder is like having that \u201cfeeling in the pit of your stomach that something isn\u2019t quite right\u201d just before something bad happens, except you feel it constantly. A cactus is just a really aggressive cucumber. It would be great if your body could store sleep hours, like sleep for 16 hours, then you could stay up for two days without getting tired!! The internet could really use a fiction and non fiction section. You know you've won when they start attacking you and not your argument.

It\u2019s so much easier falling asleep on a couch unintentionally than it is falling asleep on a bed intentionally. If poison has an expiration date, does it get more poisonous or less poisonous. Remember that we're so dumb we made an undo button for the undo button. Your future spouse is currently walking around making memories that they\u2019ll tell you about one day. It doesn\u2019t matter how old you get, buying snacks for a road trip always feels like you are an unsupervised 8 year old who was given money. Nothing hits you like a dog not liking you. Your bed is a wireless charger that takes about 7-10 hours to fully charge a specific type of human. It's awful to feel so afraid of failing that you feel afraid of trying. Remember angry birds?

Every cell in your body knows how to replicate DNA, but you don\u2019t. Romance movies are relationship p*rnography and give people unrealistic views about love. Being an adult is just hiding how immature you actually are from other adults doing the same thing.. The best part about being an introvert is all the money you save by not doing social interactions. So many people are in love, but not together. So many people are together, but aren\u2019t in love... Social anxiety is just conspiracy theories about yourself. There\u2019s a big difference between getting up at 6 a.m. to go to work and getting up at 6 a.m. to sit by the fire with a hot cup of coffee while everyone else is sleeping. Being an adult is like one of those choose your own adventure stories but every option sounds terrible and costs way too much. If someone else has an awkward moment, I will forget about it almost immediately. But if I have an awkward moment, I think about it constantly for years... Life is just a really long story about how you died. People are getting way better at holding back coughs. If you\u2019re bi and you don\u2019t have a male or female partner, you\u2019re on standbi. Introverts need time to recover from social interaction because they\u2019ve been acting all day. Too many people live their lives like Chess, always planning 12 steps ahead and trying to \u201cwin\u201d. But life is more like Tetris. You can only ever know what is immediately coming next and try to not die for as long as possible. It\u2019s messed up that when you have low self-esteem, other people liking you makes you question their judgement. People on their phone appear lazy while people using a laptop appear productive even though you can do the same things on your phone and its actually faster and more productive to use phone for many tasks. Plastic takes 1000 years to decompose, and plastic was invented 113 years ago. Therefore, there is not a single piece of plastic that has fully decomposed. Nothing sucks more than being sleepy the entire day and unable to fall asleep at night. It\u2019s easiest to sleep when you're not supposed to. If two characters in a book agree on something then they are both figuratively and literally on the same page. Your not afraid of being alone in the woods ur afraid that your not alone in the woods. Therapy is paying someone $200 to ask you questions until you cry. For depressed people, walking around with a mouth covering is a nice way to not have to worry about forcing smiles when you really don't want to. We all love sleep but hate going to sleep, and love being awake but hate waking up. If school taught practical things like doing taxes, or fixing a broken down car, or how to defend against an attacker, just things that are actually helpful, school would be so much better. It sucks being smart enough to know that you\u2019re not very smart. Sleeping when you\u2019re not supposed to is a lot easier than sleeping when you are. Being afraid to check your bank account is the adult version of being afraid to check your grades, while as a college student you are afraid to check both. You'll probably encounter the same stranger multiple times in your life and not even realise it. Not many things are quite as enjoyable as the process of falling asleep when you\u2019re really really tired. Jealousy is often considered a negative emotion, but it\u2019s an incredibly honest one. You can learn a lot about yourself by reflecting on who or what you\u2019re jealous of. At some point in our life, we just stop playing with our shadow and never think about it again.

Knowing you have the next day off is more relieving than the actual day off. The first 18 years of your life is not representative of how the rest will go. The sooner you realise this, the better off you\u2019ll be. You know you are adulting right when you finally figure out that no one actually knows how to adult. You always win arguments in your head because everyone there thinks like you. 99% of issues arise because humans don't want to admit they are wrong. Adulthood is a never-ending scam. As you get older, the reasons you have to cry are more valid. Yet, the act of crying is more frowned upon. You only have one birthday, the rest are congratulations for surviving.

As a kid, adults were seen as carefree and cool, but as an adult, kids are seen as carefree and cool. It shows that life sucks as you experience it. Beds are so much more comfortable when you\u2019re not supposed to be In them. People who talk to themselves are not crazy, they are talking to themselves to avoid becoming crazy. Think of the amount of times where you went to somewhere fun as a child and hung out with another kid that was there, just to never see them ever again Mental exhaustion is more tiring than physical exhaustion..

Being in love in a dream is the purest feeling ever that you can't remember unless you experience it. If better things come to those who wait, then procrastination is a virtue. We men want to feel strong but really we just want head pats and being pampered by a girl we like. A chess match between a mind reader and someone who can see the future would glitch the matrix. Among Us reality has taught us that it's never enough just to be right, you have to be able to convince people that you're actually right. You can know someone for years and not know what color their eyes are. People often talk about leaving a better planet for our children but don't think about leaving better children for our planet.

The biggest letdown of growing up is realising how childish so many adults are. Your soulmate is out there, but you guys will never meet each other because neither of you like to go out. Your brain automatically transfers wtf but not lol. Adults hate being told \u201cno\u201d more than children do. We have woken up so many times and we're still not used to it. Cuddling is amazing until you realise you cannot move. You can argue that the opposite of assassin is dickdickout. Moving to other planets does very little if we don't change human behaviour.

Worst part of being a kid was not having adults take you seriously when you knew what you were talking about. The 15 minutes of extra sleep after you wake up feels like a lot more than the 8 hours of sleep that you just had.

Villains probably take so long to explain their evil plan because they have no one to talk to. Smoking actually makes you cooler, since a dead body is colder than a living one. If you're an only child, you have control of whether an entire bloodline dies or not. Since female mosquitoes need our blood to lay their eggs, in a sense we\u2019re all co-parents of a bunch of little mosquitoes. if beer is liquid courage than coffee must be liquid motivation. Humanity\u2019s most impressive survival instinct is the instinct to pull your feet under your blanket to protect yourself from monsters. No one taught you. You never saw others do it. You just knew.

You can pronounce \"drink\" like \"jrink\" your whole life and no one would know. H*ll and F*ck put together make heck, which is considered more family friendly. Putting happy cows on meat and dairy products is actually kind of sadistic. In school we are taught about all the cruelty and backwardness of humans during history.

One of the biggest goals of adulthood is to make enough money to be as carefree as you were when you were a child. You\u2019ve probably passed a pigeon on the street with the same birthday as you. Saying you sold an hour of your life for $15 sounds a lot worse than saying you work for $15 an hour. Replying \u201ck\u201d in morse \u201c-.-\u201d, has the same passive aggressive tone. Yeah sex is cool but have you ever slept without a blanket and woken up to find yourself covered with one. Pizza is an acceptable meal at any time of the day. Marriage is the ultimate co-op game.

It\u2019s weird how every person knows a different version of you. The 21st century skipped over the \u201croaring 20s\u201d decade and went straight into the Great Depression. It's very disturbing that the history we learn isn't 100% true and many interesting moments have been hidden, covered up or changed completely to fit those who pass it down.

You really don't understand how dumb most adults are until you become one. The answer to the age old half empty or full glass question: It depends on your last action with it. If you drank from it it's half empty, but if you filled it it's half full. Social anxiety and general awkwardness can come from parents that teach us what not to do in social situations but forget to teach us what to do.

Aren't you sometimes surprised when you type your password in the shittiest/fastest way possible, and it still works. Someone out there has the highest success rate of inserting the usb correctly on their first try... Comedy news shows used to make shit up to be funny, now they just tell the truth. We are taught by society that following the crowd is stupid. Nobody bothers to teach us that doing the opposite of the crowd can be just as stupid. There is no greater moment of empathy and understanding as a man seeing another man get hit in the balls. It would be super cool if after we died we could see a list of all our life stats like how much money we have spent, how much distance traveled, how much food we have eaten, etc...

If you close both your eyes, you see black. If you close just one eye, it sees nothing. Kids don\u2019t just dislike vegetables, they dislike the boiled, unseasoned ones they were forced to eat. A white person and a black person are unnecessary labels of the same species. If you lay down with enough force you can fall asleep instantly. You aren't paid according to how hard you work, you are paid according to how hard you are to replace. If you\u2019re ever feeling lonely, remember there are billions of cells in your body and all they care about is you.

We're living through events that look like something straight out of a history textbook. Getting a package in the mail is more fun than buying it at the store because you get to open the package like a present. Music is the closest thing we have to mind control.

If being a \u201cmoody teenager\u201d wasn\u2019t so stereotyped then teenagers might feel more comfortable talking about mental health. EAT becomes FAT if you don\u2019t draw the line. We never realise how skinny we are at a point in time until we get fatter and look back at our older pictures. Introverts need time to recover from social interaction because they\u2019ve been acting all day.

Cassette tapes had a side A and a side B, it\u2019s only logical that the CD was their successor. Sneezing with a mask on feels like shitting your pants with your face. I\u2019ve never been told when to do my taxes, how, or why. I have never been explained what taxes are, but If I get it wrong, I go to jail. Can a ghost and a zombie come from the same person? What if phobias are made from how you died in a past life. Best example for \"You either die a hero or live long enough to see your self become a villain\" is PLASTIC.

We live in a generation where robots are named Sophia and kids are named X \u00c6 A-12 Introverts don\u2019t make new friends, they just get adopted by extroverts!!

English teachers out there waiting for schools to re open so they can give students an essay topic \"How I spent my lockdown\". Breaking up is like deleting a game you spent lots of time, progress and money on.

Have you ever wondered how many fictional characters you\u2019ve absorbed into your personality. This generation is so used to depression that its become a source of humour.

I used to think I was in a bad mood but it\u2019s been a couple of years now so I guess this is just who I am now. I don\u2019t dislike mornings. I dislike being woken up and having to do a bunch of stuff right after. People who wear pyjamas in public have either given up on life or are living it to the fullest.

Dates are just interviews for sex. Insults only hurt when you already believe what they\u2019re saying. When you\u2019re dead, you won\u2019t even know that you\u2019re dead. It\u2019s a pain only felt by others. Same thing when you\u2019re stupid. Having the ability to fall asleep instantly would improve many people's lives. Ironically jogging pants are worn by the laziest people. A big part of becoming an adult is realising nobody gives a crap if you wear the same pants two (or more) days in a row.

The only reason we grow out of childhood fears like monsters and the dark is because we get real things to be scared of like taxes and dying alone.

Everyone hates being sung happy birthday, and everyone hates singing happy birthday, so what the heck are we doing here. Why is it that you can hold a pee for 3+ hours but not the 3 seconds it takes to take off your pants? The human race should take a three year break from making babies and sort some shit out. As you get older, your birthday goes from a huge celebration to a mild inconvenience. Every t-shirt I\u2019ve ever bought is a future pajama top. Every time I read any variation of \u201c2 hours later\u201d it\u2019s in a french accent. Thanks SpongeBob. If age taught me one thing it is : Days are long, years are short. Every time I see the cat staring at \u201cnothing\u201d on the ceiling I have to prepare myself for two possibilities: bug or demon. You hate your alarm both when it works and when it doesn\u2019t. Imagine the life and body you could have if you just had some discipline. \u201cThey\u2019re coming for you.\u201d And \u201cnobody\u2019s coming for you.\u201d can both be very menacing threats.

Looney Toons doesn\u2019t get enough credit for introducing countless children to classical music. We\u2019ve done more for the environment by doing absolutely nothing than we have in years. It\u2019s possible that writers with depression have come up with awe inspiring ideas and written the book entirely in their head, but their depression kept them from having the motivation to bring it to reality.

Commas, are, reading, speed, bumps \u201cStay safe\u201d is the new \u201cGoodbye\u201d Your adult personality is your child personality filtered through society. If you hear birds chirping before the sun\u2019s out, you\u2019re either ultra productive or you\u2019ve lost control of your life. When a cat falls asleep in your lap it\u2019s not a display of trust as we believe it to be. It\u2019s the ultimate display of dominance; for they know we will not move until they allow it.

Our definition of \u201cessential worker\u201d is very rarely reflected in what they\u2019re paid. Cats and dogs get along much better than we were led to believe as children. Breakfast can\u2019t be skipped, only delayed. You spend your childhood trying to get your own bedroom and you spend your adulthood trying to find someone to share it with. As everyone who\u2019s pulled an all nighter knows, as soon as that first bird makes a noise, it instantly becomes day.

Quarantine made me realise that I have no real hobbies besides going out to eat and spend money. This march has been the longest year of my life. https://t.co/gUhWksAFfK Being part of a major historical event sucks. A lot of people are going to realise that the world still goes on without them going to work. I miss cancelling plans with my friends :( Humanity clicked on a link from an unknown email address. When quarantine is over don't ask me if I am free.. just say when and where. Anxiety about potentially having shortness of breath gives you shortness of breath. We thought we were going into the roaring 20s but instead we just got the great depression 2.0 Now I know why dogs get excited so to go for walks. This quarantine has taught me to reply everyone. If college wasn\u2019t so expensive maybe we would have more medical professionals available. We can all agree 2020 has been pretty sh*t so far.\nBut remember starting in April it will be 4/20 for an entire month. Quarantine has really shown me that I am, at all times, simply waiting to eat my next meal. I don't know who needs to hear this, but today is Wednesday. Feels like we\u2019re stuck on Sunday. I\u2019d have preferred zombies, at least you can see that sh*t. It\u2019s times like these when you truly realize how useless celebrities are and how essential your average grocery and health care worker is. Every house has a smell that only people living in the house don\u2019t smell. If a person stops to ask themselves if they\u2019re a bad person because of what they did in the past, chances are they are just a good person who made some mistakes. It\u2019s scary how your body can replicate the feeling of falling from high altitudes in nightmares when you\u2019ve never fallen like that before. We all owe 2019 an apology for what we said about it. My adult years have made me question why anyone would go big when they could go home. All of a sudden parents are ok with us sitting down and staring at a screen for a few hours straight. 4am feels totally different when you have to wake up at 4am versus when you been up all night past 4am. I\u2019ll never understand why some people feel their kids owe them something. The kid didn\u2019t bring itself into this crazy world. A human came out of a human because a human came into a human. Do you ever get that sudden outburst of motivation to go out and make your life better then after 5 minutes you\u2019re like \u201c yeah that\u2019s not happenin\u201d George Washington died in 1799, the first Dinosaur fossil was discovered in 1824. George Washington never knew Dinosaurs existed. Having anxiety/low self-worth is comparable to being trapped inside an abusive relationship with yourself.

This is the closest thing to a summer break adults will ever get. Everyone today be acting like the people in our math books. Your 150 millionth grandfather was a fish. We all just kind of accept it as normal that a meat tentacle lives inside of our mouth. This is definitely the most \u201cFriday-the-13th\u201d Friday the 13th we\u2019ve had in a while. Whoever discovered cocaine probably just wanted to smell it. There are parallel universes, where this text doesn\u2019t exist. There are also parallel universes, where this text was made by you, not me. Being able to sleep on command would be the most useful superpower. Considering most kittens are raised in cardboard boxes when they\u2019re nursing, it\u2019s no wonder cats love getting in them. Like visiting your childhood home. Life could be worse. Milk could have pulp. The people who say \u201clife\u2019s not fair, get over it\u201d are usually the people who are directly making life unfair. -4\u00b0 looks like a sad person on a toilet. Every time someone dies information is lost that only they knew and no one else. The art of raising a child is the delicate balance of how to traumatise them just enough to make them functional members of society. The scariest part of growing up is realising you possess some of the same flaws that your parents have. Foxes are just cat software installed into dog hardware. People don\u2019t get crankier as they age - they just become less tolerant of other people\u2019s shit. If 99% of people find you unattractive, 78,000,000 people still find you attractive. The language babies inner thoughts are before they learn how to speak is the actual Human language. Spotify needs a \u201cnever play this again\u201d option. We\u2019ve been practicing going to sleep and waking up every day of our lives and some of us still haven\u2019t gotten good at doing either. You either exercise because you hate your body or because you love your body. It is funny about getting older, our eyesight may weaken yet we can see through people much better. Philosophers don\u2019t think outside the box, they ask why there is a box. One big difference between men and women is that if a woman says \u201cSmell this\u2026\u201d it will usually smell nice. People ask you what you do for a living so they can calculate the level of respect they have for you. Millennials are known as the generation where everyone got a trophy for participating, but no one points out the parents that kicked and screamed when their kids didn\u2019t get a trophy. If marriage licenses had to be renewed periodically like all other licenses, not only would divorcing be a lot cleaner, but spouses might be discouraged from taking each other for granted. If you\u2019re optimist, you\u2019re always either right, or disappointed. If you\u2019re a pessimist, you\u2019re always either right, or pleasantly surprised.

Maybe late isn't so bad. Imagine how amazing a rave in an Ikea would be, like a giant house party in all the fake rooms. Somehow it\u2019s socially acceptable to put another person\u2019s genitals in your mouth, but eat ONE Skittle off the floor and you\u2019re \u201cgross\u201d. A stranger will remember you years from now because of some throwaway line you used in a brief conversation, and probably tells that story multiple times in his/her lifetime about you. But you\u2019ll never know that. When you have to study, tidying up the house suddenly becomes the best decision you took in your life. You will never know what memories you lost. The only two satisfying ways to eat popcorn is like a horse or like a lizard. Somewhere, there\u2019s a person who recalls something brave or wise that you said or did and thinks of you as someone who really has their shit together. Imagine a fish coming into your living room wearing a mask and watching you eat breakfast. That\u2019s what snorkeling is to them you sick weirdo. Social anxiety is basically conspiracy theories about yourself. Being a Millenial is like joining a game of Monopoly when every property already has a hotel on it. Older music wasn\u2019t better the bad stuff just wasn\u2019t remembered. Need to get new shampoo. The worst moment ever is when you realise that you\u2019re the one who was wrong in the middle of an argument. Your future self may be thinking about you at this very moment in time. Your dog has no idea that they\u2019re the main reason for the walk. People who voluntarily take parenting classes are not the people who need to take parenting classes. Maybe the Mayan world-ending prediction in 2012 was more of a suggestion. If Apple ever made a car they would probably have oddly sized/shaped cup holders just so people would buy their custom drink containers. When you\u2019re in 1st Grade, 6th Graders looked like adults. Then when you\u2019re in 7th Grade, seniors look like adults. Then you\u2019re a senior and you realise you\u2019re still a kid. One day, you will either wake up and never go to sleep again, or go to sleep and never wake up again. High school is basically like a free trial on education and once you graduate they ask for $50,000 if you want to continue. 3 AM is \u201ca late night\u201d. 5 AM is an \u201cearly morning\u201d. 4 AM is where you just stare at the clock and try to categorise it but you can\u2019t. Going to the movies alone is considered odd when it\u2019s actually the perfect activity to do alone. If your friends tell you not to give in to peer pressure and you don\u2019t, technically, you did. It's crazy how you can be the same age as someone, but at a completely different stage in your life. A therapy dog is essentially just a regular dog who passed a program and has an \u201cOfficial Good Boy\u201d license. Giving a hug and receiving a hug are two completely different feelings. Sleeping in your own bed after being gone for a while is one of the most satisfying things in the world. No woman wearing a dress with pockets will fail to mention that it has pockets upon receiving a compliment on said dress. Being an adult is like carrying a huge ball of laundry, you think you\u2019ve got everything under control until you look back and see all of your socks scattered across the floor. We're lucky we can't control and be productive in our dreams, otherwise our culture would have us studying/working 20 hours a day. Microwaves and humans both say \"mmmm\" when you give them food. It's hard to let someone know that they're bad at taking criticism. You know you are an adult when you get excited to just go home. Your body knows how to do almost everything you learn in biology class about the human body, it just doesn't tell you. If someone is cheating on their significant other to be with you, they will have no problem with cheating on you. We miss the nineties so much because that was the last decade before the rise of social media and cellphones. Since then, our lives have been spent online and they seem to move faster and faster every year. No matter how synchronised synchronised swimmers are, they\u2019ll never be as synchronised as someone that keeps unlocking the car door for you to get in and you keep pulling the handle at the same time. The Powerpuff girls get their power from Chemical X, as in the X Chromosome. Their power is girl power. You don\u2019t realize how long a minute is until you start doing planks. You also don\u2019t realize how fast a minute is until you\u2019re waiting for your next set. Sleep is the body\u2019s best safety mechanism. It keeps you from screwing things up for 8 hours. You can accidentally make a human being but you can\u2019t accidentally bake a cake. The generation complaining about millennials not working are the ones not hiring them. If humans didn't have 10 fingers there's a good chance we wouldn't use base 10 for our numbering system. As a kid a wiggling tooth is exciting. As an adult a wiggling tooth is terrifying. If we do live in a simulation, maybe magic did exist during the dark ages, but it was patched out by the devs. If a pet has stayed with you their full life, then from their point of view you have always existed and will always exist. If we successfully colonize Mars, then Earth will have its first true competitor for Miss Universe. So many heroes would have been dead if the villain just did less talking. \"Noted\" is the respectful corporate version of \"Whatever\" Your current partner will be either the most important person at your wedding or not even present. A lot of people that park like an asshole aren\u2019t actually assholes, they just parked next to an asshole who then left. People who sleep naked don\u2019t have any fear of emergencies. There is no physical evidence to say that today is Friday, we all just have to trust that someone has kept count since the first one ever. Sheet music is just a sound recipe. Adulthood is like losing your mom in the grocery store for the rest of your life. The only thing separating you from certain death at 65mph is a painted white line and a mutual agreement to not play bumper cars. When someone accuses you of being lazy, it\u2019s almost always because you aren\u2019t doing something they want you to do; so it\u2019s a shaming tactic rather than constructive criticism. It would be cool to have a movie shot by 2 directors and 2 versions released showing the protagonists and antagonists story. Admitting that you are wrong is the same as acknowledging that you learned something. Sometimes being a known as a \u201cgood kid\u201d growing up meant you weren\u2019t very good at being a kid. Maybe ghosts DO exist, but they\u2019re all out exploring jungles or mountains, instead of haunting people in boring houses. Sex between a man and a woman usually involves the woman doing everything she can to orgasm while the man does everything he can to not orgasm. If chickens are ever able to tell the story of their species, humans are gonna look like the most evil villains in history. When the person you\u2019re dating asks \u201cWhat are we?\u201d it\u2019s like the free trial period has expired and you have to decide whether or not to get a subscription. A person that does something dumb becomes cute if you like them. There are people out there you haven\u2019t met yet who will love you. We would all be happier if we believed the good things people say about us instead of the bad things we think about ourselves. As an adult, truly realising that \u201cyou can do whatever you want\u201d is the most inspiring and terrifying thing in the world. We spend 20 years of our life learning, to work for next 40 years so that we can afford to live out the next 20 years. The most unrealistic part of any superhero show is the part where the super hero can hold down a 9-5 job, stay out late, and function properly on almost no sleep. Sleep is such a weird concept. You lie there with your eyes closed doing nothing, then all of the sudden your mind just stops, but you have no memory of when this happens when you wake up.. Procrastinating is just enjoying all of the side quests of life while delaying the real mission at hand. Maybe crickets have the exact opposite sense of humor to us, so whenever you hear crickets after a bad joke it\u2019s just your tiny fan club absolutely dying with laughter. Working in groups in school was never meant to teach you teamwork. It was meant to teach you the incompetence of your co-workers. You can turn your ordinary sofa into a sofa bed simply by forgetting your wife\u2019s birthday. As a kid you think adults are these very serious people, then you grow up and realise everyone's just a big kid trapped in a system. We don't teach kids how to learn, we teach them how to pass. An onion is the bass player of food. You would probably not enjoy it solo, but you\u2019d miss it if it wasn\u2019t there. You never realize just how well you can impersonate yourself until you're struggling with depression. Clothes that are not dirty enough to go to the laundry but not quite clean for the closet, go to the chair. Friends are like bananas. If you peel their skin and eat them, they die. If humans suddenly lost the ability to tell lies, the world would be in flames in a matter of hours. There is nothing more relaxing than going to bed at night and knowing that your schedule is free the next day. If you get a girl home and she\u2019s wearing matching underwear, it wasn't your idea to have sex. If you go to jail for tax evasion, you\u2019re living off taxes because you didn\u2019t pay taxes. Peoples mental state would be a lot different if they remembered all the times they made people laugh instead of all the times they failed. Your younger self is your older version. Depression feels like being tired of a long days work even though you\u2019ve been home doing nothing. The biggest injustice in this miserable life is the fact that exhaustion stacks up but sleep doesn't. People are more depressed now because they can do nothing and still be able to survived. Back in the day they had no other choice to do something in order to survive. Lack of purpose is a big factor in happiness. Somebody heard snoring and thought, \"Yeah, that's the letter Z.\" Humans invented machines to skip some effort and now go to gym to make up for the skipped effort. We humans are weird. We run everywhere in video games because we're too lazy to walk, but In real life we walk everywhere because we're too lazy to run. The reason Ouija boards say \u201cDon\u2019t play alone.\u201d is because if you did, nothing would happen. Punishment for honesty is what makes us lie. Depression is like wanting to go home but already being there. You spend your entire life waiting for something. You're always free to do whatever you want until you're told you're not. Isn\u2019t it weird how we basically have an endless mental conversation with ourselves. It seems like everyone in university is smarter and more qualified than you\u2026 except your group project members. One day you\u2019re not old and the next day you have a favourite supermarket. A marriage proposal is only one knee away from begging. Ironically, the inventor(s) of the Telephone wanted to bring people closer together. No matter how talented you are you will most likely need to know the right people to truly succeed. They say money can\u2019t buy happiness, but antidepressants sure aren\u2019t free. When Hollywood actors brush their teeth in movies there\u2019s no toothpaste foam. When I brush my teeth I get foam on my lips, my chin, my shirt, the mirror and my toes. There is no sleep as comfortable as the sleep you shouldn\u2019t be sleeping. Men tell their daughters and sisters not to talk to strangers but get upset when women who don\u2019t know them don\u2019t want to talk to them. I get more motivated by the phrase \u201cF**k it\u201d than any other motivational phrase The word \"quiet\" is often said very loud. Being a teenager, you suffer from both the consequences of \u201cYou\u2019re just a kid\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re a grown adult\u201d We had to destroy the environment to get to the technological level to understand we were destroying the environment. Buying used silverware doesn't seem pleasant but using restaurant silverware that has been used hundreds of times by different people seems completely fine and normal. Sucking on a hard candy until it completely dissolves without chewing it is an incredible feat of self control. We spend obscene amounts of money on vehicles and makes sure they have the features and comforts we want, only to drive aggressively and speed home to get out of it as fast as possible. Thor could have also gone for the thumb in infinity war, because he can't snap without a thumb. Life is just a really long story about how you died. They should stop selling razors by gender and start selling them by which part of the body you are shaving. i.e. Groin razors, face razors, leg razors. The mentality \u201cit\u2019s only $5, why not buy it?\u201d has probably cost me over $5000 dollars in my lifetime. Imagine what a spider wearing flip flops would sound like. There should be two shuffle modes. One for songs you play frequently, and one for songs you haven\u2019t heard in a while. My true soul-mate and I will probably be to shy to say hello to each other. Do you ever get that sudden outburst of motivation to go out and make your life better then after 5 minutes you\u2019re like \u201c yeah that\u2019s not happening\u201d A human came out of a human because a human came into a human. 4am feels totally different when you have to wake up at 4am versus when you been up all night past 4am. People who are rude to retail workers should be punished by having to work in retail for a week. I love talking to small children. No adult is ever going to ask me what my third favourite dinosaur is. If someone else has an awkward moment, I\u2019ll forget about it almost immediately. But if I have an awkward moment, I think about it constantly for years. I\u2019ll never understand why some people feel their kids owe them something. The kid didn\u2019t bring itself into this crazy world. Being depressed when you otherwise have a nice life feels a lot the same like having a full pack of cigarettes and no lighter. My adult years have made me question why anyone would go big when they could go home. A \"lap\" is a non-existent body part that imaginably exists only when you are sitting. We don\u2019t give enough credit to our ancestors for figuring out what we can and cannot eat safely. They are the real heroes. Everybody wants you to work hard, but nobody wants to hear about how hard you work. We should have a holiday like the Purge, but instead of killing people customer service employees are allowed to say whatever they want to customers. If Jon Snow is turned into a white walker, does he become Jonny Walker or Snow White? I definitely would go slightly out of my way to step on a crunchy looking leaf. If you marry the right person, for the rest of your life you\u2019ll be \u201cdoing what you love.\u201d Websites telling me I\u2019m using adblocker is a bit like a vampire at the window: \u201cI notice you\u2019ve got your windows locked\u2026\u201d I hope after I die I get to see my stats like, number of breaths taken, number of good deeds, number of house flies killed with my bare hands. The world has become so competitive now. If you share your troubles with someone, they start sharing their own to prove that your troubles are nothing compared to theirs, instead of just sympathizing. Attractive people probably think that everyone is a lot more friendly than they really are. Your funeral is the one thing you will attend and miss simultaneously. No wonder cats and dogs hate each other. One wags their tail when they're excited, the other when annoyed. It's all a huge misunderstanding. Buying erasers is literally paying for your mistakes. Demanding respect because you are older is a form of participation trophy. Everybody is gangsta until the cockroach starts flying. Somewhere someone on this earth needs a person just like you in their life, and they\u2019re always wishing for you to show up. \u201cSurviving high school\u201d now has a whole new meaning. You don\u2019t realise what a terrible singer you are until you\u2019re singing at the top of your lungs and the music suddenly stops or skips and you\u2019re forced to listen to yourself carrying a note that you have no business singing. If you suddenly realise that you're dumb, you're now less dumber than the time just before realisation. Being a baby must be traumatizing at times. Imagine going to sleep in your house and you wake up at Target. One day you\u2019ll stop being asked what you want to be when you grow up, and instead be asked what you wanted to be. It's only AFTER you graduate/leave a place or school that they put all the fancy shit in like AC, renovations, laptops, etc. When you wish upon a star you\u2019re actually a few million years late. That star is dead, just like your dreams. They say you can\u2019t put a price tag on knowledge, but they then put knowledge in books and sell it to students for way too much money. Going to the cinema alone is often seen as very odd but it\u2019s actually one of the most appropriate activities to do solo. The first rule of passive aggressive club is\u2026you know what, nevermind. It\u2019s FINE. There would be a lot less babies if women had to orgasm in order to conceive. It\u2019s so insane that no matter how weird your dream is, they seem completely normal when you\u2019re in them. Like, you could be riding a giant chicken and it\u2019d be totally normal. The reason why moms always know where everything is is because they're the ones moving our things all the time. People spend billions on movies about saving the world but no one spends billions on real life saving the world. Some people think they're better than you because they grew up richer. Some people think they're better than you because they grew up poorer. Meeting new people is great because you haven\u2019t done/said anything cringy around them yet. Sleeping is the only way to not feel pain or depression. Driving the speed limit on a 1-lane road may be the easiest way to make enemies without doing anything wrong. Minty is just cold spicy. Smarter people are more depressed because they see how the world really is, not what it is made out to be. For a procrastinator, deadlines are both the most stressful, and the most helpful thing in life. Best advice you can get going into adulthood is don\u2019t trust anyone who talks down to janitors, trashmen, maids etc. What idiot named it hereditary depression instead of blue genes. Your cringiest memories are actually just your most important lessons of the do\u2019s and don'ts of social interaction. Someone will be the last person who reads this sentence. The only thing that makes being human tolerable is going into a dark room, curling up into fetal position, and being unconscious for 8 hours a day. Nobody says \u2018huh\u2019 quicker than a person that heard exactly what you said. If you buy the same type of sock every time losing one of the pair will not affect you in any way. The only thing that\u2019s worse than being ignored by the other gender is being ignored by automatic door sensors. If you think about it we're all wet on the inside. True love is finding that special person you are comfortable exposing 95% of your true self to, and it doesn\u2019t result in catastrophe. Ever wonder if the bank just looks through your account and think what the f**k is this person doing. The worst part about being a kid is always being told what to do. The worst part about becoming an adult is not being told what to do. After honey was first discovered, there was likely a period where people were taste testing any available slime from insects. In 500 years a young archeologist is going to find someones preserved sketch book with crazy monsters, dark horror beings and evil Garfield sketches and spend his whole career trying to prove their existence. Not having to set an alarm on the weekends feels so great even though you're going to wake up at the same time anyways. The older you get, the more you feel sorry for Tom and see Jerry as the villain. One of the best feelings in life is waking up from a vivid dream where you think something horrible is real and realizing it was just a dream. We\u2019re lucky that our bodies require sleep, otherwise our cultures would have us working 16-20 hour days. Doing nothing all day seems nice until you\u2019ve actually done nothing all day and then wish you had. History would be the most interesting subject in school if they taught just how raunchy, and violent, History really is. Imagine a new episode of Game of Thrones every time you went to class. Adulthood is having the \"there's food at the house\" talk with yourself. Bananas are always emitting ethylene gas which makes other fruit ripen quicker, but they also grow in bunches. Each bunch of bananas is a battle royale to see who can kill the others fastest. Travel size toothpastes last way longer than they have any right to. Ironically, being a food source for humans is probably the single most effective way for an animal to ensure the perpetual survival of their species. As a kid, the thought of living in a huge house was magical. As an adult, the thought of living in a huge house causes anxiety about the cleaning required. Somewhere in the world is a tree exactly your age. Part of growing up is learning to say \u201cf**k off\u201d in nicer ways every year Humans have terrible battery life. 8 hours of charging, 16 hours of use. It\u2019s funny how drinking 8 cups of water a day seems impossible but 7 beers and 5 shots in two hours goes down like a fat kid on a seesaw. You will never know what memories you lost. Once you hit a certain age, life is pretty much a list of chores you keep repeating till you die. If marriage licenses had to be renewed periodically like all other licenses, not only would divorcing be a lot cleaner, but spouses might be discouraged from taking each other for granted. Colleges make you take \u201ccore classes\u201d unrelated to your subject so they can milk two more years of tuition out of you. Once you know how to read, you can't stop reading. You know you\u2019re getting old when your parents start disappointing you, instead of you disappointing them. You know you're getting old when everyone around you gets pregnant on purpose. Moonlight is 100% solar powered. Acting is the art of pretending to not be pretending. Having someone's phone number memorized nowadays is a lot more significant sign of your relationship's strength/intimacy than it was 10 years ago 4\u00b0 looks like a guy who's having a hard time pooping. Before you start at a new job, everyone hears a new hire is coming in and hopes it's someone hot... then you show up. Every decision you\u2019ve ever made in your life, has led you to this exact moment where you\u2019re reading a pointless post, simply for entertainment. When you set an alarm at 2:00 am for 7:00 am and your phone says \"alarm set for 5 hours from now\" it is unnecessary salt on the wound. To sleep, you must trick your body into thinking it\u2019s asleep. To wake up, you must trick your mind into thinking that it doesn\u2019t fu**ing hate life. People\u2019s voices get suddenly annoying the instant you know they\u2019re a toxic or bad person. The only thing that bottled water companies actually produce is plastic. Sometimes, the only reason people buy new clothes is to have higher chances of taking them off.
