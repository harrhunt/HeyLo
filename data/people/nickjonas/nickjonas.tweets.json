We must all do the work to be ANTI racist and stand with the black community. \n\nIn our first step towards our continued efforts to help fight this fight, Pri and I have donated to the @eji_org &amp; @ACLU. Pri &amp; I have heavy hearts ... The reality of the inequalities in this country, and around the world, are glaring. Systemic racism, bigotry and exclusion has gone on for far too long, and remaining silent not only reinforces it, but it allows it to continue. We need real leadership that unites and does not oppress. We need real change! NOW! It\u2019s time for change. KEKE FOR PRESIDENT. https://t.co/1MKEyqWXby https://t.co/CVIF1umLZF Too important.

Watching all that has transpired over the last few days has been incredibly heartbreaking. Blatant racism and lack of leadership and so many lives lost. Justice needs to be served! No one should ever have to say \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d at the hands and/or knees of law enforcement. Praying for #GeorgeFloyd and his family. A family lost their loved one\u00a0while pleading for help and the simple act to breathe. This is inexcusable.

I love you all. #letlovewin Being given more words to speak... means being given more responsibility. I commend @twitter for doing their part to help us all say more, which will in turn allow us to make a bigger impact globally. #letlovewin I love my fans/followers and friends who are also committed to doing their part to make the world a better place. You are truly amazing, and every single one of you can be apart of a move towards a beautiful world. #letlovewin To every single person effected by any and every act of violence or hate or natural disaster. Please know that I am with you. Beyond my thoughts and prayers I am making a commitment that my social media platforms will be used as a tool to find governmental and social resolutions. There are so many ways we can all get involved to do our part to make the world a better place, and I'm hopeful that in the coming months and years these social media platforms that give all of us a voice to make the world a better place will enable us to do our part #letlovewin I choose to be apart of the understanding and acknowledgement that there is a real problem, and that we can be the solution. #letlovewin Next. Hate and or biased based on someone's race or background or religious beliefs or sexual orientation or identification... THIS MUST END. We are all one. #letlovewin Okay. Real talk. Let's start with mass shootings. THIS HAS TO STOP. Too many innocent lives lost. My heart breaks every time I look at the news, and see that people that showed up to pray... or go to a concert or were just fucking walking down the street were killed. #letlovewin Ah man I ran out of characters... \ud83d\ude11 I guess it'll just have to wait till I'm not limited anymore. Hey everyone. I just wanted to say I'm not afraid to over share anymore. 160 characters used to define my point of view, but now being given over 200 characters is so liberating. I feel like I should start my first 260 character post by saying everything I wanted to say before.. Craigslist Missed Connections is a truly incredible place.
