Thank you for understanding me even when I don't say anything! Thank you for always listening, whether it's my rubbish or my advice!! (5/7) Everyone knows him for his intelligence and knowledge about this business, his witty humour but for me, it's his family values and beautiful upbringing that sets him apart as a person. I don't know if we realise it, we are same-same but different \ud83d\ude1c (4/7) Non judgemental and caring, Arjun has truly taught me how to handle this complex industry and business. He has the right to scream at me when I mess up, and vice versa. 3am friend? Totally. (3/7) I don't think I would have wanted to share this journey with anybody else but Arjun. He is my most compatible co-star, trustworthy mentor and honest friend. I can totally be myself and never have to apologise for it.
