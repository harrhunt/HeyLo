It's easy and secure. \n\nTrump himself has done it for years. \n\nYet the RNC has announced it is doubling its litigation budget to prop up discriminatory laws. \n\nAnd the president keeps tweeting. 1. Provide free or prepaid postage so no one has to pay to vote.\n\n2. Count ballots postmarked on or before Election Day.\n\n3. Reform signature matching laws to protect voters.\n\n4. Allow community organizations to help collect &amp; deliver sealed ballots. We have the data to guide us not only to implement voting by mail, but to make it secure and effective.\n\nIt comes down to state laws meeting four requirements (memorize these, there will be a quiz): We can't allow a public health crisis to become a crisis for our democracy.\n\nThe solution: We must dramatically expand and safeguard voting by mail. We saw it happen in Wisconsin, when GOP officials refused to postpone an election in April.\n\nThe result: Long lines, suppressed turnout for some groups, and over 50 voters &amp; poll workers testing positive for COVID-19. Free and fair access to voting shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue.\n\nBut the reality is that Republican officials are actively seeking to undermine our elections by cutting off voters\u2019 ability to safely cast ballots this fall.

For #InternationalWomensDay, I'm issuing you a challenge. \n\nWe know that when women run for office, they're elected at the same rate as men. \n\nBut not as many women run as men\u2014often because people don't ask women to run as often as they ask men. In other words: Women's rights are human rights and human rights are women's rights. Period. \n\nCall your members of Congress today and ask them to support the Reproductive Rights Are Human Rights Act: (202) 224-3121 #ReproRightsAreHumanRights By requiring annual reporting on women's access to basic health care like contraception, safe abortion, and maternal health care around the world, Congress can make sure the rights of women and girls will no longer be up for grabs in each election. Women's reproductive rights are human rights that are universal and indivisible. \n\nGovernments do not get to pick and choose whose rights and which rights will be respected. I introduced reproductive rights sections to the reports while I was secretary of state because access to reproductive health care is a protected human right affecting women's right to life, equality, and freedom from inhumane treatment. Her U.S. asylum officer opens up the State Department's human rights reports and finds no information about those 17 women imprisoned for miscarrying or El Salvador's abortion ban. He deems she has no credible fear of persecution if she returns home. He denies her application. Imagine how this can play out. A woman living in El Salvador, where abortion is banned, is raped and becomes pregnant. She suffers a miscarriage and decides to flee the country knowing that 17 of her countrywomen were sentenced to up to 40 years in prison after miscarrying. Of particular note: U.S. immigration judges and asylum officers use the human rights reports to evaluate the credibility of an applicant's fear of persecution. Human rights reports that contradict an asylum seeker in virtually any way can be fatal to an asylum application. Human rights advocates, lawmakers, academics, businesses, NGOs, and other institutions all over the world use the reports to inform their work as well. Some background: \n\nAll branches of the U.S. government use the State Department's human rights reports to shape policy and inform decision-making around diplomacy and allocations of aid and security. Important legislation introduced yesterday: The Reproductive Rights Are Human Rights Act would correct the Trump administration's dangerous decision to remove reporting on reproductive rights from the State Department's annual reports on human rights practices around the world.
