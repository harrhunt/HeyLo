(2/2) Quick favor: can writers please stop asking women in the public eye - particularly women of color -  if they have \u201cimposter syndrome\u201d? The implication of course being that the writers think they are imposters (1/2) When your doorbell rings and you\u2019re not expecting any deliveries https://t.co/jJBg7r0zTN This one hits different https://t.co/KgDHE0B2pz Absolutely loved #MissJuneteenth starring @NikkiBeharie!

I have been a proud member for years. I was the 1st woman of color nominated for writing a comedy script. Why not say \u201cyears ago we prevented a deserving woman of color from getting credit for her accomplishments. We\u2019re sorry and it would never happen now.\u201d? @wallerABC7 No no I just didn\u2019t want people to think I was claiming her brilliant quote as mine! @wallerABC7 Toni Morrison said it! I was quoting her! (3) The point is, we shouldn\u2019t have be bailed out because of the kindness our more powerful white male colleagues. Not mentioning it seemed like glossing over my story. This was like ten years ago. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t happen now. But it happened to me. (2) But I worked so hard and it was humiliating. I had written so many episodes, put in so much time in the editing room, just to have the Academy discard it because they couldn\u2019t fathom I was capable of doing it all. Thankfully I was rescued by my friends, the other producers. I\u2019ve never wanted to bring up that incident because The Office was one of the greatest creative experiences of my life, and who would want to have an adversarial relationship with the Academy, who has the ongoing power to enhance our careers with awards? (1) Respectfully, the Academy\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t make any sense. I *was* singled out. There were other Office writer-performer-producers who were NOT cut from the list. Just me. The most junior person, and woman of color. Easiest to dismiss. Just sayin\u2019.  https://t.co/frT2pQUfLF @oliviawilde Hahahahahhaa this is so funny Lewks on lewks.

(via #thepakistanimarthastewart) https://t.co/Ua6OM4b2Ua @BusyPhilipps WHIMSY!!! @jackburditt Oh it\u2019s real! But it does seem like something I made up! My friend Julia Powell found this pic of me from high school! I think we were rehearsing the musical Rags, where I played a rag picker. What a time. https://t.co/6UwPOPa7Xd @TheSunnyDhillon What a fun day! \u2764\ufe0f I guess I want to encourage writers out there to write specs. It\u2019s not futile, it\u2019s TRAINING and it\u2019s impressive. Showrunners want to read specs! Even if the showrunner doesn\u2019t know the specific show you\u2019re spec-ing, good writing is good writing, and it will shine through! This is so smart! https://t.co/FgUcOYb49S @weareallpeople We had Taco Bell today!!! @davidstassen David, this is just ridiculous @beejoli @naanking @djgoor I guess I\u2019m saying I would be far more likely to hire someone with a great spec script than anything else. It shows off such a valuable skill set. And some of the funniest show creators out there got their first job with a spec. @rcbl @BittrScrptReadr Disagree. I think it\u2019s really valuable to see someone put their original voice into an existing show. That\u2019s kind of what the job of being a staff writer is (to me). I meant spec script samples of other tv shows when people are staffing. Not movies or whatever Why don\u2019t people submit spec scripts anymore? I like to see writers who can adapt their great voice to a great show and succeed. That\u2019s so much part of the job as a writer. @weareallpeople Britt, a pineapple traitor in my own house! https://t.co/qEX9VeDPfY @MrJoshCharles Look, you\u2019re extremely hot in don\u2019t tell mom the babysitters dead, but this is cray #hawaiianpizza4ever RT @StephenAtHome: My heart breaks for all those at the Al Noor and Linwood Mosques and for the great people of New Zealand.
