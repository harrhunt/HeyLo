It made me super tough and appreciative for how awesome, resilient and SUCCESSFUL young women are here now. They wouldn\u2019t take that shit In LA comedy, as a woman, you couldn\u2019t not be white. You couldn\u2019t not be skinny. You had to be a thin white woman who wore unsexy clothes but somehow also talked like a sexy baby. The rules were so weird. Anyway it\u2019s great it\u2019s not 2005! My first year in LA I cried every day. I hated that all my co-workers were more settled or had gone to college with each other. I hated that I wasn\u2019t sexy! This was in 2005 when to be funny and be a girl you needed to have a kind of low monotone voice have a sex kitten persona @mindypleasedmme Ahhhhh!! I will!! Sorry for the delay!! @naanking Horrible. I had no self esteem Another 20s memory: waiting in line to sign up for an open mic stand-up set at a club on 3rd. Got there early and was 2nd in line. But the guy in front of me wrote down the names of 30 of his friends so I wasn\u2019t up until 1:30am. I still remember that guy and his shitty friends I remembered suddenly today that in my 20s, a whimsical date for a comedy writer guy was to take a girl to a public high school production of a play or musical.

Ask me what I\u2019m preparing for my bbq this weekend. (For my quarantine crew before people get mad. It\u2019s 3 people ) Watched Unsolved Mysteries before bed again. It was the Rey Rivera one.

Feeling very, very loved \ud83c\udf82 https://t.co/v4Cd8d4X75 (2/2) \u2063\u2063If you can, please take a few minutes today to demand justice for Breonna. Call Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear 502-564-2611\u2063\u2063. Email Attorney General Daniel Cameron attorney.general@ag.ky.gov\u2063\u2063. Sign the @Change #JusticeforBreonna Petition \u2063\u2063 (1/2) I\u2019m so grateful for my lucky life and to be celebrating another blessed year. Of course there are so many people who don\u2019t get to because of systemic racism and police brutality. My birthday wish is accountability for the men who murdered Breonna Taylor.\u2063\u2063 \u2018Cause no one is wondering if Ava Duvernay or Awkafina or Reese or Michaela Cole has imposter syndrome, dude. We just think they\u2019re awesome. It makes it so the woman has to pretend she DOES have imposter syndrome or risk looking arrogant. The answer is no. I don\u2019t remember David Benioff or Steve Levitan being asked if they have \u201cimposter syndrome\u201d. Because they would laugh in your face. (2/2) Quick favor: can writers please stop asking women in the public eye - particularly women of color -  if they have \u201cimposter syndrome\u201d? The implication of course being that the writers think they are imposters (1/2) When your doorbell rings and you\u2019re not expecting any deliveries https://t.co/jJBg7r0zTN This one hits different https://t.co/KgDHE0B2pz Absolutely loved #MissJuneteenth starring @NikkiBeharie!

I have been a proud member for years. I was the 1st woman of color nominated for writing a comedy script. Why not say \u201cyears ago we prevented a deserving woman of color from getting credit for her accomplishments. We\u2019re sorry and it would never happen now.\u201d? @wallerABC7 No no I just didn\u2019t want people to think I was claiming her brilliant quote as mine! @wallerABC7 Toni Morrison said it! I was quoting her! (3) The point is, we shouldn\u2019t have be bailed out because of the kindness our more powerful white male colleagues. Not mentioning it seemed like glossing over my story. This was like ten years ago. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t happen now. But it happened to me. (2) But I worked so hard and it was humiliating. I had written so many episodes, put in so much time in the editing room, just to have the Academy discard it because they couldn\u2019t fathom I was capable of doing it all. Thankfully I was rescued by my friends, the other producers. I\u2019ve never wanted to bring up that incident because The Office was one of the greatest creative experiences of my life, and who would want to have an adversarial relationship with the Academy, who has the ongoing power to enhance our careers with awards? (1) Respectfully, the Academy\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t make any sense. I *was* singled out. There were other Office writer-performer-producers who were NOT cut from the list. Just me. The most junior person, and woman of color. Easiest to dismiss. Just sayin\u2019.  https://t.co/frT2pQUfLF @oliviawilde Hahahahahhaa this is so funny Lewks on lewks.
