That children who can tolerate it, wear masks.

When you talk about forcing teachers to come back to school you better be careful about that and make sure you pay attention to keeping them safe and healthy.\" - Dr. Fauci \"What we don't know - do children get infected as easily as adults? We started at @NIH on May 31 a study of 6,000 people in 2,000 families looking at the rate and prevelance in children. We should know that answer by Dec. 2020.\" - Dr. Fauci \"It's called herd immunity. If you get enough people protected, the virus has no place to go. That critical level varies from virus to virus.

In 2013, President Barack Obama posthumously awarded Rustin the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom posthumously pardoned Rustin for his 1953 arrest for consensual sex with men. 2. He advocated for nonviolent means of protest and was a close advisor to Martin Luther King Jr. Rustin helped organize the 1963 March on Washington, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the New York City school boycott to protest de facto segregation. 1. Bayard Rustin (1912-1987) was a civil rights organizer &amp; gay rights activist. As an openly gay man, Rustin often organized behind the scenes during the Civil Rights Movement.
