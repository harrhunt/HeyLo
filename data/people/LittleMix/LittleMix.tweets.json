I think I would\u2019ve found it so much harder if I was just doing it for myself if that makes sense? Knowing it was for charity kept me going. #ReturnToKili https://t.co/fY6aPr0O1Y The altitude sickness is quite scary as it\u2019s something I\u2019ve never felt before. And on summit night I found it hard to breath which made me panic. It was so much harder than I thought it was going to be. #ReturnToKili https://t.co/5YdvR0B1yi We did! We shared a tent with Dani \ud83d\udc95 #ReturnToKili https://t.co/NLwerVG9OX I would have been so gutted if I didn\u2019t make the top. I can\u2019t believe we all made it together! We said 9 of none \u2665\ufe0f #ReturnToKili https://t.co/jLLoPCwlQw @thirlwalarrie Of course! It felt so weird having no signal for the week and not being able to keep in touch with you all. But actually probably quite healthy for the soul too to have time to yourself with your own thoughts \u2601\ufe0f #ReturnToKili Unbelievable support! From the whole team, each other, our lovely fans and all the public! It\u2019s amazing to see so many people come together to support something so worthy \u2728 #ReturntoKili https://t.co/RbgbOaWL5t There was a point when the altitude sickness was bad that I wasn\u2019t sure how I was going to keep walking for hours and hours. On summit night, it was so gruelling I wanted to just fall asleep and be rolled back down \ud83d\ude02 but knowing why we were doing it kept me going. #ReturnToKili https://t.co/nHXW9qOqvv Whenever any of us were down or unwell, everyone was there for each other and it was very special \u2665\ufe0f I got an extra big brother now @mrdanwalker who stayed with me at the back everyday as I was the slowest \ud83d\ude02 #ReturnToKili https://t.co/C64Bnphz1G I have a better perspective on everything.
