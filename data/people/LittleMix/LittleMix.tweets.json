It was in the running for first single when it first came around. Jade x #Confetti Not A Pop Song stemmed from the stigma attached to being in a girlband/guilty pleasure over the years.

As soon as Perrie suggested Confetti that was it \ud83e\udd73 @olivia_LM_ Probably Break Up Song as there was such a gap in between the first session and last. It came together last minute, when the original first single was going ahead!

Jade x https://t.co/hdmr7inx1F On #Confetti probably GLOVES UP. Whenever we work with Meg (Salute, Move...) we bash them out so quickly as she knows us so well and it\u2019s so fun! It\u2019s always going to be extra/theatrical and I think for me I find it easiest to write that way, when there\u2019s a big concept.
