Here in my hometown, Public Health Seattle &amp; King County (@KCPubHealth) is doing incredible work that we should all be very proud of. All the work that rich countries are doing now to develop vaccines will save lives in developing countries too. Without a vaccine, those countries are at even greater risk than wealthy ones, because it\u2019s even harder for them to do physical distancing and shutdowns. If everything goes well, there might be an effective vaccine in less than 18 months\u2014the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. That will depend on decisions we make today, including the federal government investing in building up manufacturing capacity. Work is going full speed on potential treatments, and vaccines. But people should know that it will take time to prove they are safe and effective and to start making them. There\u2019s been some progress on more efficient testing methods, such as the self-swab developed by the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network. I hope this and other innovations in testing are scaled up across the country soon. https://t.co/qdrr7Qz16r The federal government needs to step up on testing: far more tests should be made available, and we should aggregate the results so we can quickly identify potential volunteers for clinical trials and know with confidence when it\u2019s time to return to normal. Extreme physical distancing measures will make a big difference in the U.S., but we need a consistent nationwide approach. Until the case numbers start to go down across America\u2014which could take 10 weeks or more\u2014no one can continue business as usual or relax the shutdown. There\u2019s no question the United States missed the opportunity to get ahead of the novel #coronavirus. But the window for making important decisions hasn\u2019t closed. The choices we and our leaders make now will have an enormous impact. https://t.co/mAa2XWwBIB I\u2019m inspired by the generosity of everyone who has contributed to this effort to help keep kids learning at home.

Here\u2019s what I really think. https://t.co/OuiTD1oI4Z If your New Year\u2019s resolution is to be healthier in 2020, this book is a good place to start. https://t.co/Fu5isRsAHd I\u2019m glad @beautiful__news is highlighting some of the amazing things happening in the world. https://t.co/MSbKErgru1 RT @melindagates: Sir Fazle was a humanitarian who helped us learn about development work: Building an efficient organization while never f\u2026 Vaclav Smil is one of my favorite thinkers, and I couldn\u2019t wait to get my hands on his new book about the growth of *everything*. https://t.co/3R8UWhEcwb What\u2019s next for our foundation? I\u2019m particularly excited about what the next year could mean for one of the best buys in global health: vaccines. https://t.co/MbjNWPEl5l I\u2019ve read a lot of books about history over the years, and These Truths by Jill Lepore is the most honest and unflinching account of the American story I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s also one of the most beautifully written. https://t.co/fYfIFLrmrq Check out my end of year books list (plus a bonus recommendation) on @Likewise. https://t.co/ZE0Sa2ib8u December is a great time to take stock of everything you\u2019ve done over the last twelve months\u2014including all of the books you\u2019ve read. I found these books to be really clever and engaging. I hope you them find as intriguing as I did: https://t.co/xKdpvoXbvR https://t.co/XZguGFYssO Back in my early Microsoft days, I routinely pulled all-nighters when we had to deliver a piece of software. I even stayed up two nights in a row on occasion\u2013I don\u2019t recommend that. This book taught me a lot about the importance of a better night's sleep. https://t.co/xUthhTyRb6 This new treatment is a gamechanger for millions of people living with HIV in South Africa. I\u2019m optimistic that it could help #EndAIDS around the world. https://t.co/vrvqM9DA3w I was deeply moved by Tayari Jones\u2019s story of a married couple whose lives get torn apart by an incident of injustice. The book is so well-written that you\u2019ll find yourself sucked into it despite the heavy subject matter. https://t.co/JAhJOFwdOm Here are two amazing statistics: primary health care interventions could save 60 million lives in low-and middle-income countries and increase average life expectancy by 3.7 years by 2030: https://t.co/VfDzACwTNu #HealthForAll https://t.co/tQTEyIaQj3 Diane Tavenner had a simple but very ambitious goal: \u201cWe wanted to teach kids not just what they needed to get into college, but what they needed to live a good life.\u201d You can read an excerpt from her wonderful new book on my blog. https://t.co/hYwdeNFTPM I\u2019ve read a lot of great books this year. Here are some I think you\u2019ll enjoy reading over the holidays. https://t.co/YOpc07Qv3T I'm a big fan of @SiliconHBO and was excited when they asked me to appear in the series finale tonight. #AlwaysBlue https://t.co/kDnM81w8IF Thank you, Sue, for your extraordinary leadership. Melinda and I are grateful for the opportunity we\u2019ve had to learn with and from you over the past five-and-a-half years, and we wish you and your family the best. https://t.co/VsVPTo731p I really enjoyed sitting down with @reidhoffman to talk about the role great cofounders and partners have played in my career, like Paul Allen at Microsoft and @melindagates at the Gates Foundation. You can listen to our conversation here: https://t.co/GlFWwylYcI https://t.co/JQjdxFGxle Technology has made it faster and easier than ever before for people everywhere to give. I\u2019m inspired by how many people from all over the world participate in #GivingTuesday. https://t.co/CkwcQb5roI https://t.co/VjIycC6Kig I was impressed to see the tremendous impact @Gestamp\u2019s apprenticeship program is having on students and their community: https://t.co/VFuOrRM9ms https://t.co/2GkWeB6Ojj This #WorldAIDSDay, I\u2019m excited about breakthroughs in treating and preventing HIV thanks to organizations like the @GlobalFund. https://t.co/Sm5dUhTR2A The world has made incredible strides toward ending the AIDS epidemic over the last twenty years, and I\u2019m optimistic that more progress is on the way. Explore the data: https://t.co/uQ05HXrrPL #WorldAIDSDay At @Gestamp, an auto parts maker in Chattanooga, Tennessee, I saw how the factory is putting high school students on a path to opportunity: https://t.co/EAB1Enj48G https://t.co/3rhl9PSfQt Dr. LeAndrea Ware is one of the most energetic school leaders I\u2019ve ever met. Her positivity is infectious. It\u2019s no wonder she was recently named the Tennessee principal of the year: https://t.co/wGwZju8qS7 https://t.co/SmZDJNXzvL We\u2019re getting closer to having a blood test for Alzheimer\u2019s \u2013 which could help doctors detect and diagnose the disease earlier: https://t.co/L6m5WYhova https://t.co/AyR2EqyEHO US education may be the hardest issue our foundation works on. A recent visit to The Howard School in Chattanooga, Tennessee reminded me why it\u2019s also one of the most inspiring. https://t.co/927CwK2imF You could find wild poliovirus in 125 countries in 1988. Today, it exists in just two. And more than 18 million people are walking today who would otherwise have been paralyzed by polio. Here\u2019s why we aren\u2019t done yet: https://t.co/uXZoglQS7Z https://t.co/rY2eMaDReI The incredible, diverse global partnership that halted wild polio\u2019s spread in Nigeria 3 years ago makes me optimistic we\u2019ll #EndPolio worldwide. https://t.co/Kr3ibLXdmd Some of our most vital partners in the fight to #EndPolio are philanthropies like @alwaleed_philan, @bloombergdotorg, Tahir Foundation, Dalio Philanthropies &amp; Ningxia Yanbao Charity Foundation. Their support has helped deliver vaccines and protect millions from polio paralysis. https://t.co/w6yUlN1CwX Even a single child paralyzed by polio is one too many, but I\u2019m optimistic that we will eradicate the disease thanks to the GPEI\u2019s persistence and creativity. https://t.co/olGWetQPSN In Abu Dhabi this week, the world committed $2.6B to #EndPolio. Thank you @MohamedBinZayed for your leadership in helping push this terrible disease to the brink of eradication. https://t.co/7tr4wNQjRK @narendramodi .@narendramodi's leadership has been a catalyst to India's progress on improving health, nutrition and ensuring safe sanitation practices for many. @PMOIndia The more I\u2019ve learned about Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the more I\u2019ve come to admire the volunteers who participate in clinical trials, and their caregivers too. Here\u2019s a way you can help fight Alzheimer\u2019s: https://t.co/isfZoyZFPU https://t.co/rS27wglMOJ Better tools for collecting and sharing data will help community health workers protect families in the poorest parts of the world.  https://t.co/dVONnMcY4c Expanding the diversity of therapies in the pipeline and more efficiently recruiting patients for clinical trials will increase our odds of discovering a breakthrough. I\u2019m hopeful it will lead to an intervention that reduces the impact of Alzheimer\u2019s. https://t.co/j8DZbeUp8F @ewarren I\u2019m always willing to talk about creative solutions to these problems. @ewarren I greatly respect your commitment to finding ways to address wealth inequality and poverty at home. While we may disagree about some of the ways to get there, we certainly agree we need a lot of smart people committed to finding the path forward. @ewarren You and the other candidates are having a really interesting conversation on how to solve some of the world\u2019s toughest problems like eliminating global poverty and avoiding a climate disaster (though those issues don\u2019t get talked about as much as they should). One of the many awful things about watching someone you love struggle with Alzheimer\u2019s is the feeling of helplessness. You keep thinking that there must be something more you can do. Here's one option. https://t.co/TQ1Z0lYCkN We have cut the number of child deaths in half over the last 20 years. New tools like these precision maps from \n@IHME_UW will help us cut child mortality in half again by 2030.  https://t.co/9XfRu6WuLK Buildings are one of the five areas where we need a lot of innovation if we\u2019re going to avoid a climate disaster. I wrote about one company with a particularly clever approach. https://t.co/OXdxSChPCX A lot of work remains, but it\u2019s exciting to see positive data on a drug candidate that may alter the course of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. https://t.co/h97EBGqWyJ I always like to try out a new TV show or two when I\u2019m on the road. What should I watch next? I set up an Ask on @Likewise to collect your recommendations. https://t.co/6Knu7M3wyO \"This is a solvable problem.\" @CarbonCure (which I\u2019ve helped fund through @btenergy Ventures) has developed an innovative way to reduce cement's carbon footprint: https://t.co/9gvmkPGtnT https://t.co/zaqUc3In6R One of the best parts of my job is getting to work with some of the world\u2019s most brilliant minds on seemingly intractable problems. Here\u2019s how we\u2019re trying to tackle one of the defining technical challenges of our time. https://t.co/F2Wd8vM4ia This is one of the most important topics in medicine today: how can we make data more readily available for researchers to look for patterns and identify new pathways for treatment. https://t.co/hcji8sAhmy The world has made incredible progress toward the goal to #endpolio thanks to partners like @MohamedBinZayed and the UAE. https://t.co/80j0A3MyJg Melinda and I feel pressure to make every dollar and every day count, which is why we say no to a lot more opportunities than we say yes to. Working with partners around the world to #EndPolio has been a fight worth every dollar. https://t.co/a3gcP3M2HV Tackling the world\u2019s toughest health challenges requires the best that science has to offer. Thank you to @NIHDirector and @WHOAFRO for your partnership. https://t.co/85nrN9FFS2 Congrats to the 2019 winners of the @NobelPrize in chemistry! Few inventions have changed our lives as much as the battery, and the quest to build a better one is an important step in the fight against climate change. https://t.co/8XrKz2Zw1s Malnutrition is the single greatest health inequity in the world. In its 2019 State of the World\u2019s Children report, @UNICEF takes a critical look at how we can help everyone reach their full potential by improving access to nutrition. https://t.co/rpwu3XuuGt The world\u2019s poorest people often rely on farming both to feed their families and to earn an income. They will be among the first to face the effects of climate change. I\u2019m excited about innovations aimed at addressing this problem: https://t.co/H7KrSXFo4b https://t.co/1QJg3gyJZY Congrats to Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer for winning this year\u2019s @NobelPrize in economics. I\u2019ve learned a lot from their pioneering work to better understand the complexities of the lives of the world\u2019s poorest people. https://t.co/Uc0XeytGRs The world is facing a crisis at the dinner table, one that climate change will only worsen. I\u2019m optimistic about the progress being made by @RIPEproject on a much-needed breakthrough. https://t.co/pzM61gDdWE The odds of dying of AIDS in South Africa are less than half what they were at the peak. That progress wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the @GlobalFund and other global health organizations. Even more progress is possible if we keep up the fight: https://t.co/71W2exSVZT https://t.co/f2gJwuIb9H We need more approaches to stopping #Alzheimers disease. I\u2019m excited to see this news out of @DZNE_de and @ISD_Research about a promising starting point for the development of new therapeutic strategies. https://t.co/zj81EbL7X6 I\u2019m impressed by the international cooperation that made this year\u2019s @GlobalFund Replenishment round possible. The world has committed more than ever before. Our foundation is proud to commit $700 million to over the next 3 years. #StepUptheFight https://t.co/mfuamNyygd I can\u2019t think of a more fitting tribute to Hans Rosling and his life\u2019s work. Hans was a dear friend to Melinda and me \u2013 and inspired us all with his passion, intelligence, and wit. https://t.co/gYfioNQBuW I\u2019m in Lyon, France for the @GlobalFund\u2019s replenishment \u2013 celebrating the most money ever raised for their life-saving work. I\u2019m excited for the day that these diseases are in the history books. #StepUptheFight https://t.co/isnpGkyNWE In Afghanistan, one of the last countries with polio, vaccine acceptance rates have reached 98% thanks to the tireless work of female health workers. Their increased involvement and passion is why polio eradication is within reach in Afghanistan. https://t.co/v2yPVeSCiz If all countries in the world had the same concentration of researchers as wealthy ones, there would be 3x as many researchers. That\u2019s mind-blowing. We all lose out when talent isn\u2019t connected with opportunity. @OurWorldInData https://t.co/a9m56tDdLp Malnutrition is the greatest health inequity in the world. I recently spoke with my friend @AlikoDangote about how we can use iodized salt to help kids gets the nutrients they need: https://t.co/PXp3WeJfEy https://t.co/qpQ51LWZuf I\u2019m lucky to have known Stephen Hawking \u2014 and he was as exceptional in person as you imagined he was. As remarkable as his contributions to physics were, his biggest accomplishment was inspiring the world to believe in the magic of science and research. https://t.co/FxiyzmBTuz Here is the story of the day I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life and the influence of someone who\u2019s been a critical guide along the way: https://t.co/KWOicXCab6 https://t.co/R62eDi82yG @TheEconomist is right: climate change touches everything and everyone -- and, unfairly, the poor and marginalized have the most to lose. \n\nIf you want to understand what can be done, I highly recommend you read this issue. https://t.co/3JZS3WsAzQ Melinda's work on behalf of women and girls around the world inspires me every day. She's committing $1 billion over the next ten years to increasing women's power and influence in the United States. Because #EqualityCantWait. https://t.co/QHnPyAeN59 I\u2019m delighted that @erna_solberg has re-upped Norway\u2019s commitment to support the work of the @GlobalFund. I welcome her sustained leadership and partnership in the fight against AIDS, TB, and malaria. https://t.co/2NTVVpmEul Most people know @AlikoDangote as Africa\u2019s wealthiest man, but I know him as one of our foundation\u2019s most impactful partners in improving health. Melinda and I are lucky to count him as a partner (and friend!) in our work. https://t.co/9Pk8seLGpi More and more children are living to see their 5th birthdays. That\u2019s because the world has made incredible progress in reducing child mortality. But progress has been uneven. We have more work to do to close the gaps across countries and within them. https://t.co/TaeiqkLD0U It's really incredible how much time and effort goes into producing a documentary like the new @netflix series I participated in. I shared more about the experience on my blog: https://t.co/BgTeiguaFf https://t.co/UzqI251nxU Ending poverty and achieving the SDGs requires a whole-of-government approach. @ImranKhanPTI and @SaniaNishtar have shown leadership in developing a new anti-poverty strategy. #Ehsaas https://t.co/tbRNz4Gbf6 .@sanchezcastejon\u2019s commitment to the @GlobalFund reflects Spain\u2019s leadership. At a time when more countries are turning inward, Spain is showing that we can\u2019t back away from our commitment to fighting poverty and disease. https://t.co/H0ffOpSGr9 RT @gatesfoundation: The third annual #Goalkeepers19 event brings together a new generation of changemakers to accelerate progress toward t\u2026 Sanitation is a difficult issue to take on because there are no easy solutions. Tonight we recognized the progress India has made on this issue through its Swachh Bharat program, under the leadership of @narendramodi. https://t.co/liTmmHl7ap I had the privilege of meeting @DrElvisEze at last year\u2019s Malaria Summit in London, and I was struck by his optimism about the fight against malaria. I think you\u2019ll be inspired by his story. https://t.co/92006G0AtA I\u2019m excited to see world leaders and climate advocates coming together to make progress at the UNGA #ClimateAction Summit. Working together we can prevent the worst effects of climate change. https://t.co/AHOwRfmk0i I\u2019ve always loved playing tennis. Maybe this is why. See more deleted scenes from the @netflix series about my life and read exclusive stories on my blog: https://t.co/bjWwDvqQkc https://t.co/HquaH9PrBc I am hopeful that we can substantially alter the course of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This World Alzheimer\u2019s Day, join me in supporting Alzheimer\u2019s research by watching and sharing @AlzResearchUK\u2019s #SharetheOrange video with @SamuelLJackson. https://t.co/5Gl8hWHXtA The docuseries about my life and work is out today. I hope you\u2019ll check it out on @netflix \u2014 and then read some of the stories that didn\u2019t make the cut on my blog. https://t.co/G6BfXXK93I Adapting to climate change requires support from governments and businesses to ensure those most at risk have the opportunity to thrive. A new report from @GCAdaptation lays out steps we can take to address this urgent issue. https://t.co/QWEGBqY3Vl The new docuseries that looks at my work is out tomorrow. I hope you check it out on @netflix. I can\u2019t wait to hear what you think: https://t.co/1UXX3xEja5. https://t.co/ZortFamUF0 As governments invest more in primary health care systems, overall health outcomes improve. Here\u2019s how: https://t.co/GqQ8EHynUP https://t.co/gBtqPBh8Vw Melinda and I started out ahead. But hundreds of millions of people around the world have to overcome hurdle after hurdle to be successful. Read about how advocates are working to even the odds for everyone: https://t.co/w0DQYCunTK https://t.co/NGmF01h66W Health and education are improving everywhere in the world. But the gap between countries\u2019 progress can be enormous. Our foundation\u2019s 2019 Goalkeepers report examines two of the biggest factors responsible for this inequality: https://t.co/TQjcnNbu2y https://t.co/FFIkp6Crzf The Lasker-Bloomberg Public Service Award is a well-deserved recognition of @gavi's life-saving work. Congratulations to all of the winners: https://t.co/Hvpw43o3jb Congratulations @BradSmi and @CarolAnnBrowne! Your insights have never been more relevant, and I am glad others will have the chance to benefit from them too. https://t.co/zDBkZk5YnB Today, it\u2019s difficult for researchers to diagnose #Alzheimers patients early enough to intervene. A reliable, easy and accurate diagnostic would be a game changer, and artificial intelligence could be the answer. https://t.co/M0FxOmUAX2 Here\u2019s a remarkable statistic: Nearly 1.1 billion fewer people are living in extreme poverty today than in 1990.  But over 700 million still live on less than $2 a day. Six of them share their stories, their challenges, and their dreams for better lives. https://t.co/8zjsa5RiP7 The fact that a quarter of the kids born on the planet don\u2019t get the right food to develop is a mind-blowing tragedy. \n\nOur growing understanding of the microbiome will make this problem #solvable: https://t.co/IUI8I6EKxi https://t.co/fIf97bjwqL Climate change is one of the toughest challenges facing the world. But don\u2019t despair\u2026\n\nScientists and entrepreneurs are working on some innovative solutions. Here are four that I\u2019m excited about: https://t.co/WKwW0PccbI https://t.co/KEdegq2V0A Manufacturing steel is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Boston Metal is working to change this, and I\u2019m excited about their approach: https://t.co/3xp7NCHPio https://t.co/RPX6TEy3J2 Tuberculosis is still the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. To #EndTB, we need to continue to develop safer and simpler solutions. The FDA\u2019s approval of a new treatment is a promising step in the right direction. https://t.co/dJQapVKgjW Whenever I hear an idea for what we can do to keep global warming in check, I always ask this question: \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan for steel?\u201d \n\nI know it sounds like an odd thing to say, but it opens the door to a very important subject. https://t.co/Oo20WYmkAZ Germany, Italy, and the European Commission have demonstrated great leadership with their commitments to the @GlobalFund. Thank you @BMZ_Bund, @GiuseppeConteIT and @EU_Commission. Your pledges will help protect the world\u2019s most vulnerable from #AIDS, #TB, and #malaria. https://t.co/gfu5ovysf2 When I think about the world I want for my children, I know that #EqualityCantWait. When women and men can reach their full potential, everyone benefits: https://t.co/Yo2Ru84nBx Canada\u2019s $930 million commitment to the @GlobalFund is a big step towards saving millions of lives. Their pledge, and the commitments of other countries, are helping to #StepUpTheFight against AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. https://t.co/wo4aKpQQ72 If we want to give our kids the best chance possible to succeed after high school, we need more teachers like @_MrHand: https://t.co/GxtYKlRH0u https://t.co/vqEtVG8XJF Today marks three years since Nigeria's last wild poliovirus case.

I\u2019m finally learning my way around the kitchen, though, thanks to Robert Hand: https://t.co/AJdkDB7fzE https://t.co/g3pQw4fxpZ Four billion people are at risk from mosquito-borne diseases. We can get that number down to zero if we invest in new tools \u2014 like a set of techniques for genetically modifying mosquitoes \u2014 to complement the ones we already have. https://t.co/YSemQDFsw6 I learned a lot from Washington State Teacher of the Year @_MrHand about creating a classroom where kids want to be (and he taught me how to make BBQ chicken). https://t.co/V1XHZDy4GG Melinda and I are big fans of @DonorsChoose, and we were thrilled to learn that @WKamauBell is, too.

But can we power the world without contributing to climate change? I think we can: https://t.co/33sGjLspfT https://t.co/NRjXc2HReH Think back to the last time you experienced a power outage. If you live in New York, you don\u2019t have to think that far back! Now imagine what it would be like not to have access to electricity at all. Nearly one billion people face that reality every day. https://t.co/4jg2JC7EVQ Five years ago, India was declared polio-free. This incredible milestone was made possible by the health workers, governments, partners, and donors who didn\u2019t rest until every child was reached.

This important @IEA report outlines how countries can support existing reactors and advance nuclear innovation. https://t.co/cS9cuHn1WA I wish I had understood much earlier in my career what true inequity looks like and how to fight it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m inspired by the story of William Wu, an engineer who started using his tech skills to fight inequity much sooner than I did: https://t.co/qEDOk3kVEo https://t.co/WDxHCur6Ki This is the teletype that brought Paul Allen and me together. And I\u2019m so glad that it did. Paul was one of the most thoughtful, brilliant, and curious people I\u2019ve ever met: https://t.co/CNw9gc5Xh7 https://t.co/pC9FIQ0kK5 More people are getting their electricity from renewable sources that ever before. Here\u2019s how we can build on the progress we\u2019ve made: https://t.co/ftMb24y6sd https://t.co/46kGyQP7EQ Today\u2019s commitment by @theresa_may to #StepUpTheFight against AIDS, TB and malaria will help save millions of lives. @GlobalFund is one of the best investments the world can make in the years ahead: https://t.co/imFw4POQzI My friendship with Paul Allen changed my life. I loved sharing some of my favorite stories about him (and a few old photos!) at the Forbes Philanthropy Summit yesterday: https://t.co/3i6SFNg9q4 https://t.co/t2t7yTBVie Few inventions have changed our lives as much as the battery. I\u2019m excited that more inventors and investors are being attracted to the quest to build a better one. https://t.co/KAyNoiaXzr It\u2019s great to see such early support from Japan in re-committing to the @GlobalFund. The support of @AbeShinzo and the Japanese people will help the world #StepUpTheFight against AIDS, TB, and malaria. https://t.co/0oitm7xmA6 I\u2019m excited about the progress we\u2019re making toward understanding Alzheimer\u2019s. For the first time, @MIT researchers have completed an analysis of the genes that are expressed in individual brain cells of Alzheimer\u2019s patients. https://t.co/lluUJ0oC9u I love talking about toilets. @NatGeo recently wrote about two that I think could change the world.\nhttps://t.co/2Q521aLrDK I\u2019m excited to see such incredible leadership from @EmmanuelMacron and the people of France towards @GlobalFund. If more countries #StepUpTheFight against AIDS, TB, and malaria, we can save 16 million lives. https://t.co/n0Wdr5ScCy I learned what\u2019s possible in agriculture from studying a remarkable scientist named Norman Borlaug. If you\u2019re curious about Borlaug and his breakthroughs, I recommend this article and a book called \u201cThe Man Who Fed the World.\u201d https://t.co/GZrs6iKxMX If you have the willingness to learn about a problem and the talent to help solve it, you can make a remarkable difference in the world. Just ask former NASA engineer William Wu: https://t.co/YDvisdSjki https://t.co/qB3qAQCrzR I encourage software developers, inventors, and scientists to consider how they can use their skills to fight inequity. https://t.co/bedv0SXjgs When @goodreads asked me to share my top summer reading recommendations, it was hard to narrow down the list. https://t.co/SlVDDIDnd7 Fighting disease is like fighting fire. It\u2019s not enough to put out most of it \u2014 you have to get it all. @Rotary\u2019s generous pledge to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will help us extinguish this terrible disease for good. https://t.co/OHdVufsVrF The fight against malaria is one of the greatest success stories in global health \u2014 but progress has slowed in recent years. To regain momentum, we must work together to combat drug and insecticide resistance. https://t.co/2vw0LMzEuX I was moved by this story: Bob\u2019s daughter has Down syndrome, which puts her at a higher risk for dementia. Motivated by her condition and his love of science, he volunteered for an #Alzheimers clinical trial. https://t.co/tfQScwYo2J Our foundation\u2019s Day of Caring is one of my dad\u2019s favorite days of the year. I know he can\u2019t wait to hear what our employees learn from our partners this year. https://t.co/D2DNr3xCgE I\u2019m always amazed by the disconnect between what we see in the news and the reality of the world around us. As my late friend Hans Rosling would say, we must fight the fear instinct that distorts our perspective: https://t.co/uQRofM4q2u https://t.co/SzXDFr4clj Thank you for being a friend, Warren: https://t.co/4hhwUvkGox #BestFriendsDay https://t.co/1hmF1WE5gC I\u2019m thrilled about the elimination of malaria from Algeria and Argentina. This news gives me hope that we\u2019ll one day get rid of the disease forever. https://t.co/mizZSMgpUe David Letterman\u2019s newest season of #MyNextGuest has a lot of fascinating guests, but there\u2019s one clear standout for me. Check out @melindagates's terrific interview on @netflix: https://t.co/vzS70LBNyj https://t.co/RBtynivvu4 Patience: it's a valuable skill for investing and for training new employees at Dairy Queen. https://t.co/654kxGktaO Warren and I recently picked up a @DairyQueen shift. I think I may have been a quicker study in the Blizzard department, but watch the video below and judge for yourself: https://t.co/BJc1nV4kpa https://t.co/J1NgS0EbfE A powerful call to action from @angienguku on the eve of #WD2019. @melindagates and I are impatient for every mother to have access to high-quality maternal care. https://t.co/ZrKzfdupVx If you\u2019re working on digital biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, I encourage you to apply for the next round of funding on the Diagnostics Accelerator website: https://t.co/pQP0E0x8oO https://t.co/3aziBMTR7c Congratulations to the first round of award recipients from @TheADDF\u2019s Diagnostics Accelerator. Your ideas are getting us closer to a reliable, affordable, and easy-to-use diagnostic for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. https://t.co/JENlb92P6h Identifying candidates for clinical trials more quickly is essential in the fight against Alzheimer\u2019s. That\u2019s why I\u2019m excited about reliable, affordable, and easy-to-use diagnostic tools like blood tests. https://t.co/pXuIUiIY4I I recently sat down with one of my favorite authors, Jared Diamond. His perspective on political polarization really caught my attention: https://t.co/cfPHMmYgcw https://t.co/F88NEAzZLp Breakthrough Energy Ventures \u2013 Europe will be a catalyst for innovative solutions to fight climate change. We have the resources to make a meaningful difference and the flexibility to move quickly. That\u2019s a rare and powerful combination. https://t.co/K4j7ggRzI4 We need the collective effort of governments, individuals, and the private sector to tackle climate change. I\u2019m excited about Canada\u2019s new partnership with @btenergy. #CEMMI2019 https://t.co/adQcnEpvxV I can\u2019t recommend these books highly enough: https://t.co/h9J71vWAcz https://t.co/3gOdcA4OaX Last year I recommended \u201cBad Blood,\u201d which is about the rise and fall of Theranos. This year I\u2019m recommending \u201cNine Pints,\u201d another book about blood that you won\u2019t want to put down. https://t.co/AcnsyCT9TR Congratulations @NarendraModi on a remarkable win in #IndianElections2019. Your continued commitment to improve health, nutrition, and development will significantly improve lives of many. @BJP4India I\u2019m a big fan of everything Jared Diamond has written, and his latest book, \u201cUpheaval,\u201d is no exception. You can download a free chapter here: https://t.co/aeB13snhM3 https://t.co/FkapORHnpH This #RedNoseDay, I\u2019m swapping out my usual summer books for something a little different. Learn how you can help end child poverty, one red nose at a time: https://t.co/8z5vwVqiCB https://t.co/KM8VRG4CHY Whether you\u2019re a political leader or just an armchair historian, you\u2019ll learn a lot from @BeschlossDC's book \u201cPresidents of War.\u201d https://t.co/YD8sOHXG9l This book will take you on a trip you\u2019ll never forget: https://t.co/l4IvTS9AHD https://t.co/mNkg6G9lof Looking for a summer read? You can\u2019t go wrong with one of these great books: https://t.co/xB82XMnJY9 This is great news: wind and solar power generation is expanding at record rates, allowing more people to get their electricity from renewable sources than ever before. Here\u2019s how we can move even faster towards a zero-carbon future: https://t.co/dtpxiKGHSb https://t.co/6tAITSZGp3 Together, we can achieve what @Rotary first envisioned: a world where no child will be struck with polio ever again. This weekend, I was honored to thank @RotaryRassin and other Rotarians in person for their dedication to the fight against polio. https://t.co/sYNHU7RqGS Nearly every job created since the last recession has gone to someone with a post-high school education. But which degrees and programs provide the greatest value? Our foundation is launching a new commission to find out: https://t.co/382oqYQ161 https://t.co/i1JXF0xTzU A college degree is the surest path to a healthy, rewarding life and career. But which degrees and programs provide the greatest value to students? Our foundation CEO @SueDHellmann is co-chairing a new commission to get that data into the hands of more families. https://t.co/0lszyYXPtH Everyone at the @gatesfoundation looks forward to days when our trustee Warren is on campus. @melindagates and I couldn\u2019t ask for a better champion for our employees, partners, and grantees. https://t.co/t7vlrjNR6s It is surprisingly hard to store renewable energy. Here are three startups I\u2019m excited about that are tackling this challenge: https://t.co/ilUAEa5TVJ https://t.co/PH0bNzRSJ2 It\u2019s easy to be overwhelmed by climate change and what to do about it. I recently wrote about why I\u2019m optimistic we can prevent the worst from happening: https://t.co/J4sntwJFRO https://t.co/Ygnxjwy5Om A fascinating discussion with computer scientist @drfeifei, historian @harari_yuval, and journalist @nxthompson on the future of AI. https://t.co/6gXSOZ5oLo My mom was one of the most generous people I\u2019ve ever known. If I grew up #WithoutMom, I wouldn\u2019t be the man I am today. Join the fight against preventable maternal deaths so that no child grows up without a mother. https://t.co/8MaSCBW012 All my life I\u2019ve been surrounded by remarkable women. And I was moved when Melinda decided to write about two of them \u2014 my mother and my grandmother \u2014 in her new book, The #MomentofLift. Happy #MotherDay to all the amazing mothers out there! https://t.co/syfEgdIz2N This fascinating #dataviz looks at how the global population pyramid is changing. With the right investments in health and education, young people at the bottom of the pyramid will drive tremendous growth and innovation. https://t.co/uvx1gFL7pu I was touched when Melinda asked me to introduce her at her #MomentofLift book tour stop in Seattle tonight. I wanted to do right by her but wasn\u2019t sure what the best approach was -- so I turned to someone with some expertise in this area\u2026 https://t.co/AYKp6MPC6E 2018 National Teacher of the Year @MandyRheaWrites told me about the remarkable resilience of her students. I was inspired by their stories and Mandy\u2019s ability to connect with them: https://t.co/rMLfrtVrHv #ThankATeacher https://t.co/d7re2bbUet I really enjoyed spending time with 2017 WA State Teacher of the Year @farmtableteach. She showed me a neat lesson that can be used to teach science and engineering to students as young as 5 years old: https://t.co/iBbGi2Iu18 #ThankATeacher https://t.co/NenWzBfdIZ For Teacher Appreciation Week, I\u2019ll be highlighting some of the most impactful lessons I\u2019ve learned from educators in my home state. 2019 WA State Teacher of the Year @_MrHand showed me how he could build lesson plans that resonate with every student. #ThankATeacher https://t.co/aRYp7klSy1 RT @GatesUS: No one has more insight than teachers into what makes a classroom tick, or how to reach &amp; inspire a struggling student. \n\nHapp\u2026 I\u2019ve learned a lot from the career of this real-life Sherlock Holmes: https://t.co/LhCRp52KgN https://t.co/0GnuegjFep Melinda and I love meeting with people who are trying to change the world. Here are four of the people who inspired Melinda when she set out to write her new book, The #MomentofLift. https://t.co/SiJCanAna1 What does a \u201cdirt detective\u201d do for a living? I\u2019m eager to watch this talk from soil scientist Asmeret Asefaw Berhe about how we can use soil to fight climate change. @TEDTalks https://t.co/X6EKzhlKfU A few months ago, Fred contributed a piece to my blog which outlined why educating the next generation of African leaders will be so important. https://t.co/wCLJIENm6g By the end of the century, almost half of the young people in the world will be in sub-Saharan Africa. https://t.co/ZiBfAgjpxx .@FredSwaniker has an ambitious plan to unlock the talents of young Africans. I was thrilled to see him featured in the latest issue of #TIME100. https://t.co/9PParcGi6q It\u2019s hard for me to overstate how brave people who fight outbreaks are. They face a near-impossible task with grace under pressure: https://t.co/dZi32udwDm https://t.co/rYFftiE7Wu Congratulations @SueDHellmann on your 5th anniversary @gatesfoundation. Your leadership on some of the world\u2019s toughest challenges inspires me. https://t.co/gEQGO9MrV7 The world\u2019s historic progress to #endpolio would not be possible without the strong commitment of partners like @MohamedBinZayed and the UAE: https://t.co/MedY3Ta6vx https://t.co/FgCCRjTzG9 If you enjoyed the @Avengers this weekend, I think you\u2019ll be inspired by these real-life heroes: https://t.co/51u5y77EqZ https://t.co/0EqePCsPIH It\u2019s amazing to think about the creative ways we\u2019ve delivered vaccines over the years (even by dog sled, when necessary). Today, a startup called Zipline is even using delivery drones to reach the most remote parts of the world. https://t.co/ivkdFYc2j0 #VaccinesWork The promise and perils of gene-editing might be the most important public debate we haven\u2019t been having widely enough. I encourage you to read up on it whenever you have a chance. This @TheEconomist piece is a great place to start. https://t.co/srP2L1zu6T One of my favorite authors, @sapinker, co-wrote a piece about why nuclear power is so important in fighting climate change. It\u2019s worth reading. https://t.co/bDkDgF8sEQ Deaths from malaria have dropped 42% since 2000. I\u2019m as optimistic as ever that we can get to zero deaths in our generation: https://t.co/7PGDJv9PWG #WorldMalariaDay https://t.co/nWLLtMXz1B Stories like this one from Kenya remind me of why Melinda and I started our foundation. I'm optimistic we will continue to make progress towards the day that no child dies from a preventable disease. #VaccinesWork https://t.co/srfCk36l83 Melinda\u2019s new book, The #MomentofLift, is out today: https://t.co/sC4eE1Jy8N.\n\nShe combines her mastery of data with her ability to tell powerful stories. It was a lot of fun watching her write it, and I\u2019m excited for all of you to read it. https://t.co/Mc76kYsWIJ On #EarthDay, I\u2019m inspired by the inventors who are tackling climate change and all the people who are supporting their work. I can\u2019t wait to share their progress with you throughout the year. https://t.co/bZMYnhmZjY Melinda\u2019s new book The #MomentofLift is an urgent call to action. I\u2019ll commit to the lift by working to ensure that we collect better data about women\u2019s lives and livelihoods. https://t.co/KgFxAmXFl0 Gene drive is a technique where you give a few mosquitoes an edited gene and it drives itself into all their offspring. It could one day help us defeat diseases like malaria: https://t.co/8rlIYXbWSN https://t.co/l1I0zhg0g3 Less than a century ago, families everywhere lived in fear of a mosquito bite. Now 75% of all malaria cases occur in just 15 countries. The partners fighting this disease won\u2019t rest until we\u2019ve reached every case of malaria, while saving as many lives as possible along the way. https://t.co/WDTG7lKiDg 3: Which of the following factors affect the spread of malaria? The answer is in my latest blog post: https://t.co/Vv1rQ79zSJ 2: What kind of pathogen causes malaria? Find the answer here: https://t.co/tUPDUDpfK7 Biology pop quiz! Test your knowledge about the world\u2019s deadliest animal: the mosquito.\n\n1: Of the 3,000 species of mosquitoes, how many are responsible for most cases of malaria? Read my post to find the answer: https://t.co/ICUKMpu3EO Here\u2019s one reason why I really, really hate mosquitoes: https://t.co/DDG0kG692T #MosquitoWeek https://t.co/7qTfCLDKmu I\u2019ve been fascinated by Leonardo da Vinci for decades. Although he died 500 years ago, there\u2019s still so much to learn from his remarkable life: https://t.co/mLf6AU0QLX https://t.co/mXtaErPSN5 Precision maps are bringing us closer to the day when malaria is gone forever. https://t.co/mxqN60hOJN Why I would rather encounter a shark in the wild than a mosquito: https://t.co/6CrnkJ6f31 #MosquitoWeek https://t.co/uB5YFPLgzO I\u2019m proud that @Microsoft is one of the many companies taking action to fight climate change and excited about its leadership in using AI to accelerate progress on these challenges. https://t.co/psSwcQms3M To kick off #MosquitoWeek, I wrote about the world\u2019s deadliest shapeshifter (and what scientists are learning about how to beat it). https://t.co/EOR9vx1M20 Shapeshifters are not just the stuff of science fiction, though. We have them right here on earth. There\u2019s an epic scene at the end where Spock has to figure out which one is the impostor. https://t.co/yOSI4WyneG As a teenager, I remember watching an episode of the original Star Trek where the bad guy is a shapeshifter who turns himself into a second Captain Kirk. When I was younger, I loved science fiction. The author I read the most was Robert Heinlein (\u201cThe Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\u201d was a favorite). They're back... #MosquitoWeek https://t.co/4vt2Vt3fGN Young Africans will shape the future of not just their own communities but the entire world. https://t.co/8h83nylCgw Melinda and I were honored to join President Bush and Laura Bush @TheBushCenter. Their leadership of programs like @PEPFAR has helped save millions of lives around the world. https://t.co/hgenuuOk5j I would say this even if I weren\u2019t married to the author: @melindagates\u2019s new book \u201cThe Moment of Lift\u201d is a terrific read. You can see for yourself by downloading a free excerpt: https://t.co/BdQoC5LiIv https://t.co/Wa2GwCio4H I\u2019ve learned so much from Melinda over the years and I\u2019m delighted she is now sharing her insights with the rest of the world: https://t.co/FPw5nIAoGm https://t.co/l1vrbbw5qD I\u2019ve recommended a lot of books over the years, but The #MomentofLift is particularly special to me\u2026 https://t.co/E2ZbzXSCU5 It also includes insights about our marriage, the path we took to become equals in our work, and how she has helped me grow as a father and husband. She shares her personal journey from private citizen to public advocate -- including how she pushed our foundation to focus more on women\u2019s empowerment. \u201cThe Moment of Lift\u201d is a wise, honest, and beautifully written book about how empowering women lifts up everyone. .@melindagates is the most important person in my life: an amazing partner, wife, mother, and friend (and now accomplished author!). Her new book is a terrific read that will leave you feeling enlightened and inspired: https://t.co/iCWebQwSH1 https://t.co/CdBwQQb0QA Of the many uses for AI, I\u2019m particularly excited about how it can help improve the lives of the world\u2019s poorest. https://t.co/JFoLoWJPEL In the future, identifying your risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s could be as simple as speaking into an app on your phone: https://t.co/6BJKeQkjUk https://t.co/R6BNQagErr When Paul and I founded @Microsoft together, we were confident that computers would change the world. But we never could have imagined how much fun we would have along the way. https://t.co/YZ3l4z94ao Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from buildings is one of the five biggest challenges in the fight against climate change. I love that architects are looking to nature to find solutions. https://t.co/VXVuuCtOVY Most Americans want to know if they will get Alzheimer\u2019s as early as possible. That\u2019s an important insight for scientists as they work to improve diagnostic tools. https://t.co/Iz4ZBK4MZu Thanks to major breakthroughs over the last several years, we\u2019re closer than ever to having a reliable, affordable, and easy-to-use way to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s. https://t.co/Ba7l79tPMR This surprised me: there\u2019s more carbon in soil than in the atmosphere and all plant life combined. Here\u2019s what that means for how we fight climate change: https://t.co/i1vPN7G3Sn https://t.co/iDv16zaMh1 Pivot Bio has developed an alternative to synthetic fertilizer that could help transform farming and reduce greenhouse gas emissions: https://t.co/3keIlFe2MR https://t.co/iAdaBmKFVI I\u2019m thrilled that senators from both sides of the aisle have come together to support advanced nuclear. This is exactly the kind of leadership our country needs to both solve the climate challenge and reassert our leadership in this important industry. Nuclear energy is one of these critical technologies. It\u2019s ideal for dealing with climate change, because it is the only carbon-free, scalable energy source that\u2019s available 24 hours a day. To prevent the worst effects of climate change, we need to reach near-zero emissions on all the things that drive it\u2014agriculture, electricity, manufacturing, transportation, and buildings\u2014by investing in innovation across all sectors while deploying low cost renewables. Yesterday, a bipartisan group of leaders in the U.S. Senate introduced the Nuclear Energy Leadership Act, which establishes an ambitious plan to accelerate the development of advanced nuclear reactor technologies. I can\u2019t overstate how important this is. https://t.co/tRovGTm2sg RT @gatesfoundation: We\u2019re celebrating the anniversary of an incredible public health achievement - 5 years since the entire South-East Asi\u2026 We need to reach zero net emissions from every sector of the economy including agriculture (which, along with forestry, and land use, is responsible for almost as much greenhouse gas emissions as electricity). https://t.co/Sioivi1R9L Most discussions about fighting climate change focus on electricity and the need for renewable energy. De-carbonizing the way we generate electricity would be a huge step, but it won\u2019t be enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change. https://t.co/C4oCIz6iXg Five years ago, India was declared poliofree. Whenever someone asks me how they did it, I tell them about one of the country\u2019s lowest castes: the Musahar. https://t.co/X6AZTigffl https://t.co/I2Ija5AyKY I\u2019m inspired by Azim Premji\u2019s continued commitment to philanthropy. His latest contribution will make a tremendous impact. https://t.co/IOTiHxtivw Thanks to the incredible work of goat nurses, thousands of women in India have an opportunity to lift themselves and their families out of poverty: https://t.co/KzLMfLz5Um https://t.co/6pWqbFRLAT .@SueDHellmann recently sat down with @CDCFound to talk about how our foundation measures the impact of our partners and grantees. It\u2019s worth a listen: https://t.co/DJkkrX2Ytj https://t.co/ptBtRPBaXM Meet the goat nurses, an incredible team of health workers who help women gain financial independence by raising healthier goats. https://t.co/9yiSjvg7tL 2019 marks 150 years since the creation of the periodic table. Whenever people visit my office, I like to show them my favorite version. It\u2019s made out of samples of each element, and reminds me every day of why I\u2019m so fascinated by science and technology: https://t.co/d5sYO9ehUE https://t.co/1dVHpF9jCg If you believe innovation is for everyone, then I have a list for you: 10 challenges that the world needs your ideas to help solve. https://t.co/fnV9s61Lk3 Diversity is good for innovation. This is a great conversation between @robotsmarts and @timnitGebru on the importance of representation and female leadership in tech. https://t.co/21uMzF5Ofk If you want to discover what makes a school great, there\u2019s no substitute for spending time in the classroom. I learned a lot from the students and teachers at this Chicago school: https://t.co/hN6zJEnjQW https://t.co/pL5cHJCejq Medical advances should be available to everyone who needs them. That\u2019s why I\u2019m excited about an inexpensive blood test that could help doctors predict if a baby will be born prematurely. This information would undoubtedly save lives. https://t.co/GsCYZU7gqs It\u2019s great to see leaders in Washington talking about accelerating energy innovation to fight climate change. This op-ed from @lisamurkowski and @Sen_JoeManchin is worth reading. https://t.co/Z45BIXBLVq I was lucky to be a young person when the digital revolution was just getting under way, and my Microsoft colleagues and I had the chance to help shape it. Celebrating #Web30 leaves me feeling nostalgic about 1995. https://t.co/krIFxTGd1q Behind every progress report is a student story. As Yusef \u2014 a senior at North-Grand High School in Chicago \u2014 told me, he is \u201cseeing himself clearly\u201d in ways he couldn\u2019t before thanks to better data about his progress: https://t.co/zlGlEZPZPE https://t.co/yeKQdwXL9T When I visited Ethiopia last month, I was impressed by the government\u2019s commitment to gender equality. Ethiopian President @SahleWorkZewde explains why lifting up women benefits everyone. https://t.co/XCc6IXqRa2 Melinda\u2019s work on behalf of women and girls inspires me every day. I love this video she made for #IWD2019 https://t.co/1CeWYGPTAv Tomorrow is #IWD2019 \u2014 a day when we celebrate the progress made by and for women. To celebrate, @melindagates is sharing a chapter from her new book, \u201cThe Moment of Lift,\u201d about the lessons she\u2019s learned from women around the world. https://t.co/im5O3CRRaQ I recently visited a high school that has gone from one of Chicago\u2019s worst to one of its best: https://t.co/1GaU7pLcSs https://t.co/wHMDnmVJjF By embracing data, research, and community, schools have an opportunity to help students succeed in high school, college, and beyond. https://t.co/Yzcgxi47S3 Congrats on your 100th title @rogerfederer! Looking forward to seeing you soon. https://t.co/ztX9PIyfdI I had a great time chatting with a fellow tech enthusiast, @MKBHD. We talked about electric cars, AI, and how tech can give back. https://t.co/0e8BoDXjn3 I was excited when I thought @MarkRober brought me a hamburger. Turns out it was a bottle of swamp water\u2026 https://t.co/nwiluClsWt Reading is my favorite way to learn about a new subject. Here are 10 books that have shaped how I\u2019m thinking about technology today. https://t.co/J7UqIkRSHM Everything I\u2019ve learned about Leonardo da Vinci leads me to believe he was one of the most innovative thinkers ever. Here\u2019s what he\u2019s taught me about art, optimism, and innovation. https://t.co/9SHBSxmEBz I\u2019m a big fan of the MIT @techreview's annual list of breakthrough technologies \u2014 so when they asked me to choose this year\u2019s list, I jumped at the chance. https://t.co/FtX5QS7PYZ RT @gatesfoundation: Toilets of the future will save millions of lives. https://t.co/VlpC7LvOIR https://t.co/1rEi9oC6B9 I\u2019m on @reddit right now if you want to ask me anything: https://t.co/lfm64sWrcE https://t.co/i4Oeh72a7B Hey @reddit, come ask me anything during my AMA at 10am. https://t.co/pDsfPk304K You can\u2019t improve things if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with half the population. https://t.co/baMoi7o9g4 Who has the best musical taste in our family? Hint: It\u2019s not me\u2026 https://t.co/gMoHIPFv3v Even as someone who enjoys reading textbooks (for fun\u2026), I\u2019m excited about the online tools replacing them: https://t.co/zOEBeImDBa https://t.co/5Oo5gEB8H9 Since 2002, the @GlobalFund and its partners have saved 27 million lives. This shows what\u2019s possible when we act on the idea that all of us have a stake in the health and well-being of the poorest: https://t.co/sUZP0EA2pb https://t.co/9Sg0tKGmqE The correct answer is: Africa https://t.co/4MCsXlX8Z6 While the world gets older, one continent is staying (nearly) the same age. Which continent\u2019s median age has stayed basically flat? Check your answer here: https://t.co/g762QNCjap .@MelindaGates explains how mobile phones can help connect marginalized people to their communities, their bank accounts, and more: https://t.co/27eeYrpBKT https://t.co/FM3iUKX0kR If you believe every student should have a chance to learn how to code, nominate your favorite teacher for a @codeorg scholarship: https://t.co/f9KB0qj1te https://t.co/jXvvHtL8Mf The world keeps getting older, but Africa stays the same age. It sounds confusing, but it makes sense when you break it down: https://t.co/6dZeFCxsp3 https://t.co/hhH8IE0rQQ Electricity accounts for just 25% of greenhouse gas emissions. We need breakthroughs in five key areas to prevent the worst climate-change scenarios: https://t.co/vPalC2h56X https://t.co/1est6TTZ1U I wish more people fully understood what it will take to stop climate change. I break down the five grand challenges we face (using squishy toys): https://t.co/Nw6r3J2qrC https://t.co/OFvHFgp1xF Even if your primary concern is the welfare of your fellow citizens, these investments are overwhelmingly smart things to do. Progress benefits everyone. Here\u2019s how: https://t.co/b6S5lpyUVr https://t.co/SSFC0i6Em2 At a time when bad news seems to dominate the headlines every day, I want to keep reminding people that life is getting better for millions in the world\u2019s poorest countries, thanks in part to smart investments in health. You probably won\u2019t be too surprised to learn that I love a good cheeseburger. But you may be surprised by some of the things you read in our annual letter: https://t.co/ylXwYeSCxd https://t.co/0zb5M2ZG0Y Melinda and I are live with @wkamaubell and hundreds of high school students talking about how surprises can move us to action: https://t.co/cgCqP2fmTj https://t.co/Ns6fjSFJtA In our 2019 Annual Letter, we wrote about the things that have surprised us over the years. Some worry us. Others inspire us. All of them are moving us to action. https://t.co/GwFW6sNgVL Health is a catalyst for economic growth. I enjoyed hearing from @CyrilRamaphosa about how South Africa is investing in its human capital. https://t.co/oQZycpBAhs .@PMEthiopia Abiy Ahmed is a champion for diversity and gender equality. I enjoyed talking with him while in Addis Ababa. https://t.co/cX1pypY4cB Under @PaulKagame, Rwanda has become a leader in promoting health across the continent. We had a great conversation about the importance of continued health investment. https://t.co/FT9se17gpj This is an interesting take from @RahmEmanuel about challenging your assumptions of what makes a good school. https://t.co/2dUtj99PCS In 2009, my friend @NandanNilekani was tapped by the government of India to turn its vision for a digital ID system into a reality. A decade later, nearly all of India\u2019s 1.3 billion residents are enrolled in this impressive program: https://t.co/2YUxCRwXPE https://t.co/QisjcAtjvL I enjoyed serving as @TIME first-ever guest editor last year, and I was excited when I heard that @ava would be taking the helm this year. Congrats, Ava, on a great issue highlighting the power of \u201cart and optimism.\u201d https://t.co/5EtZmcOUor Energy innovation is the best investment we can make to prevent the worst effects of climate change. @btenergy just released a new report with @ErnestMoniz and @DanielYergin outlining near-term actions to bring more clean energy technologies to market. https://t.co/HBX9vdbnsC Nandan Nilekani is one of India's leading technology entrepreneurs. He and I are both optimistic about the potential of secure digital ID systems to improve people\u2019s lives: https://t.co/JICcHOgdJ2 https://t.co/NKLet3u07C When @melindagates and I started our foundation, we knew our investments would be high-risk, high-reward. Melinda explains why the returns have been greater than we ever could have imagined. https://t.co/XcXqPukw72 One billion people don\u2019t have an official proof of identity. One of India\u2019s leading technology entrepreneurs is working to change that: https://t.co/dQDp2kKQ7O https://t.co/eHlKmfMKZR Some good news in the Ebola fight: nearly 64,000 vaccine doses have been administered so far. Great partnership between @gavi, @WHO, and @Merck. https://t.co/X4FDBzk30p Global health organizations turned a $10 billion investment into $200 billion in benefits. You can\u2019t beat that deal: https://t.co/abKrtagQo7 https://t.co/aUiskZYxsn I love this series from @HumanProgress. I wish I could have met Norman Borlaug, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate whose work in agriculture has greatly influenced my thinking. https://t.co/qrEyNL6Kqc It\u2019s hard to beat this #10YearChallenge: https://t.co/HZqjeE2Q8t https://t.co/xyfvnBSXky I look at a lot of global health data, and one trend stands above the rest: Global health groups like @gavi, @GlobalFund, GPEI and @theGFF are some of the best investments the world can make. https://t.co/EM2dNRm8YQ Global health organizations are the best investments that Melinda and I have ever made. I look forward to continue working with you to advocate for health financing, @DrTedros. https://t.co/gPhgWmzHMZ RT @gatesfoundation: Why should we continue to invest in global health funds?\n\nBecause every $1 in = $20 out in economic benefit. https://t\u2026 I\u2019m in Davos to talk about the best returns on investment I\u2019ve ever seen: https://t.co/8xzK8zTgvm #wef19 https://t.co/KCoMCbojje .@reidhoffman\u2019s podcast is insightful for leaders at any level. I enjoyed hearing him describe how the best leaders make everyone a hero. https://t.co/NRxHZWIjtk Martin Luther King Jr. inspired civil rights legend @repjohnlewis to get in \u201cgood trouble.\u201d On #MLKDay, here\u2019s the congressman\u2019s advice for young people. https://t.co/5VssQATw04 I saw two positive trends in Alzheimer\u2019s research in 2018: fresh ideas and better data. Here\u2019s how we can make even more progress in 2019. https://t.co/TadwuxApxz This is one of my favorite infographics. A lot of people underestimate just how much life has improved over the last two centuries: https://t.co/djavT7MaW9 https://t.co/kuII7j4AuW You can\u2019t beat this ROI. https://t.co/MgzJkjec7l If we\u2019re going to win the fight against poverty, we have to be able to reach the world\u2019s poorest people. Drones could be a powerful tool in reaching the last mile. https://t.co/BRpsQHWhyg Congratulations to the Indian government on the first 100 days of @AyushmanNHA. It\u2019s great to see how many people have been reached by the program so far. @PMOIndia https://t.co/AHHktUt95z The world needs energy breakthroughs that improve people\u2019s lives without contributing to climate change. As @IEA highlights in its latest report, governments have an incredible opportunity to shape the future of energy. https://t.co/YCPep4ytgn There\u2019s never been a better time to be a student of robotics. I can\u2019t wait to see what these brilliant minds discover in the years ahead: https://t.co/UTqcm3Yzf7 https://t.co/h8knOJdw4c Good news you might have missed in 2018. https://t.co/vLwKbnaNzT When you hear the word \u201crobot,\u201d what comes to mind? At Harvard, I saw some surprising inventions that challenge our popular images of robots: https://t.co/b0vT9UZuU7 https://t.co/hAZeCEFu4J There's no question that it was a tough year for a lot of people. But @NickKristof makes a convincing case for why 2018 was actually the best year in human history. https://t.co/1FUNwLwhwR I can\u2019t think of a better person to bring these stories to light. Congratulations, @Malala. https://t.co/ZAMoQxNdyq I recently visited @Harvard to learn more about robotics research. It was exciting to speak with the many young people drawn to this rapidly growing field. https://t.co/qBqfaMndcK Melinda and I have gotten really into meditation. If you\u2019re thinking about trying mindfulness in 2019, this is the perfect introduction: https://t.co/xCMv4XYTDU https://t.co/qABXybP0vr When I was in my 20s, my year in review would amount to just one question: Is Microsoft software making the personal-computing dream come true? These are the questions I\u2019m asking myself today: https://t.co/fuBOYurIP5 #TBT https://t.co/HsQEZx7Xye Happy anniversary, @melindagates. I can\u2019t wait to spend 25 more years laughing together. https://t.co/LMJ126c3ua I hope you have a happy and healthy start to 2019. In the meantime, Melinda and I are working on our next Annual Letter, which we\u2019re going to send out in February. Although I\u2019ve never been one for New Year\u2019s resolutions, I\u2019m making one for 2019: I\u2019m committing to learn and think more about the balance between privacy and security, as well as the use of technology in education. Gene editing might be the most important public debate we\u2019re not having right now. Read up on it whenever you have a chance. Even better, read @DrSidMukherjee\u2019s \u201cThe Gene.\u201d https://t.co/4qM8faMGkp The good news is that there has been progress toward a vaccine that would protect you from every possible strain of the flu. But the world still needs to develop a global system for responding to epidemics. I had hoped that hitting the 100th anniversary of the Spanish flu would spark a lot of discussion about whether we\u2019re ready for the next global epidemic. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t, and we still are not ready. Some people think we have all the clean-energy sources we need to stop climate change. But we don\u2019t. As I wrote earlier this year, the world needs to be working on lots of solutions to stop climate change. https://t.co/I2wylMHEJE This year @btenergy, the clean-energy investment fund I\u2019m involved with, announced the first companies we\u2019re putting money into. Almost a decade ago, I predicted that the world would soon be polio free. But we had more polio cases in 2018 than in 2017. Even so, I remain optimistic that we could eradicate polio soon. Just over a year ago, I made my first investment in Alzheimer\u2019s research. I\u2019m hopeful that we can make a lot of progress in the coming years. 1/ What a year. If you\u2019re anything like me, you\u2019re taking stock of your work and your life, and wondering where all the time went. Here are a few of my thoughts as 2018 wraps up. https://t.co/N4EBlC5y4O The books that kept me up reading in 2018: https://t.co/Up1rwhXV4G https://t.co/yaoBHNV4gR I\u2019m excited to share a project I\u2019m involved with to bring Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s work to life. https://t.co/kXKDZByOhP New report from @TheAEIC shows the importance of federal investments in R&amp;D to developing cleaner energy technologies like advanced nuclear, energy storage, and carbon capture. https://t.co/9t2iJLQpgG This year I asked my Secret Santa (one of my favorite @reddit traditions) to give to a cause that matters to them. My Santa is helping a young girl continue her education in a refugee camp through @theIRC: https://t.co/wtTunWwJaW https://t.co/kkie3vk98O New data. New insights. New discoveries. These are just a few of the reasons why @gatesfoundation kept me optimistic in 2018: https://t.co/yIG2l8qhDf https://t.co/kbJsHEGH6i This one-of-a-kind device brings you closer than ever to one of history\u2019s greatest thinkers: https://t.co/PY0l9skp3B https://t.co/aH1KEaDrIr I\u2019m a fan of everything @harari_yuval has written, and his latest book is no exception. https://t.co/HJSuZRwT5n I am an optimist. For me that means that I\u2019m inspired to look for people making progress, and to help spread that progress as widely as possible. Here are some of those areas. https://t.co/57JTr2pNWm Tara Westover didn\u2019t step foot in a classroom until she was 17. At 32, she\u2019s written one of the best books of the year. I was thrilled to sit down with her to talk about her remarkable life: https://t.co/r1aQWLyTWx https://t.co/AJgvpHs3BK I often talk about how much progress we\u2019ve made in health and energy. Turns out, the same thing can be said about innovation in sports: https://t.co/kPjgGWOOzG @TEDTalks This book is a must read for anyone interested in AI, machine learning, and machine vision. https://t.co/bOFgrnkORN Since 2000, @gavi has vaccinated 700 million children, saving more than 10 million lives. That kind of progress is thanks to the many Gavi alliance partners, including the UAE. #vaccineswork https://t.co/8oNPVo08X2 When it comes to meditation, @andypuddicombe turned me from a skeptic to a believer. https://t.co/hRos0ulrH6 Good news in the fight against TB: More and more South Africans are surviving the disease: https://t.co/ROxM7LZYGH https://t.co/6AmQne28Oa Melinda explains why the next great programmer won\u2019t look anything like me (which is good for them, and for the world). https://t.co/zvBPk0msBQ My kids tease me for being the most competitive person in our family. My latest challenge? A game called \u201cGuess the Philosopher\u201d with @tarawestover: https://t.co/7pHSK0bZE8 https://t.co/IdJ2y7CEtl It\u2019s no wonder Hollywood is turning this book into a movie. I couldn\u2019t put it down. https://t.co/27nz1XKVY6 Brilliant engineers and scientists around the world are working hard to get the next generation of toilets off the ground. And then there is Ronny Chieng... https://t.co/CbdklQnpCb Everyone could use a few more books in their lives. You can\u2019t go wrong with one of these five. https://t.co/J0afS0Cj7V Five of the books I couldn\u2019t put down in 2018: https://t.co/UyDnOLSBQl https://t.co/KX53usqRYY One of my favorite authors, @sapinker, sums up why history is an imperfect guide for progress: \u201cIf history is about all the wars, all the disasters, you\u2019re missing all this incremental improvement that can only be ascertained through data.\u201d https://t.co/G4ipdkrhzm Tuberculosis has haunted humanity for millennia\u2014it\u2019s even been found in Egyptian mummies. This is the story of a doctor on the frontlines of the fight against one of the world\u2019s oldest diseases: https://t.co/PJZLdyXsyA https://t.co/eA2CbO1EOj If you\u2019re a science and data nerd like me, you may be interested in \u2018Alice and Bob Meet the Wall of Fire\u2019 and \u2018The Prime Number Conspiracy\u2019 from @QuantaMagazine and @7homaslin. https://t.co/UVoBZkI0Vb Thanks to brilliant scientists in South Africa and around the world, there are signs of hope in the fight against TB. https://t.co/FsEJTp4XRh Before we got married, Melinda and I talked about how we would give back. We agreed that, once you\u2019ve taken care of your family, the best use of extra wealth is to help make the world a better place. Join us in one of our favorite traditions https://t.co/tlrxu6FYjQ #GivingTuesday https://t.co/BjLkaiv0ks Last week I wrote about why I enjoy watching the @HBO series \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201d Here are six more shows worth catching up on. https://t.co/T4ogimPbwh via @Likewise Can we grow enough food to feed the world? Agricultural transformation is at the heart of reducing poverty and creating prosperity: https://t.co/YYRehcfd88 https://t.co/gKghvzVu48 Considering the impact Silicon Valley has on our lives, I\u2019m surprised how rarely pop culture gets it right. To understand how it works today, you should watch @SiliconHBO. Personally, I identify most with Richard Hendricks: https://t.co/EsiglR37Bo https://t.co/5agUIEUdF2 These six toilets could change the world: https://t.co/4ZXqwpQKxw #WorldToiletDay https://t.co/DKeMC4hokn The future is bright for the world\u2019s poorest farmers because of innovative companies like @myAgroFarms: https://t.co/OTckufEyN8 https://t.co/UKCfFKT3b5 I\u2019ve been impressed by @CapriaVC\u2019s work over the last several years and applaud @VulcanInc's investment in the firm. https://t.co/kCEBnTFXwt Well said, @MaxCRoser. Being an optimist doesn\u2019t mean you ignore tragedy. https://t.co/GmFeuPGjcN Farm yields in many parts of Africa are just a fifth of those in the United States. Innovations in agriculture will make it possible for poor farmers to increase their yields: https://t.co/oW7hMmOwd7 https://t.co/49j1LEo4fA Whenever I travel for the foundation, the farmers I meet talk about one thing that holds them back: they can\u2019t save their money. @myAgroFarms is one of the companies working on creative solutions to this problem. https://t.co/xcXjisdlcu I just shared the stage with a beaker of poop in China. Seriously. Here's why: https://t.co/9pH7NjRk4L https://t.co/FEvtEI7wWB The toilet hasn\u2019t really changed in more than a century. But a new generation of technology could save millions of lives. https://t.co/H5qr5b76gD There are few things I love talking about more than toilets. https://t.co/rQdY3ZiIpC Climate change may be the toughest problem humanity has ever faced \u2014 but it's solvable. Washington has a unique opportunity to lead the way as a hub for innovation on clean energy. I urge you to vote yes on 1631. Ballots must be in the mail by Tuesday. https://t.co/TjuU5KZ7pX A compelling look at how advocates and energy sector leaders are working together to tackle the real drivers of climate change. https://t.co/dQ23c8drzk .@ava I can\u2019t wait to see which stories you shine a light on in the next @TIME Optimist issue. I was thrilled to contribute. https://t.co/Y6bKit0yYQ I\u2019m at @Stanford today to talk about energy innovation. To prevent the worst effects of climate change, we need to get to zero net greenhouse gas emissions in every sector of the economy within 50 years. Here\u2019s how we can do it: https://t.co/G3iCIQL0lA #StanfordGEF https://t.co/7Mk8Plxu0V Thailand\u2019s \u201cMr. Condom\u201d has taught people that there is no reason to be shy about talking about sexual health: https://t.co/BQGQXYYiK9 https://t.co/AsnIIT6pEm Can we end extreme poverty? I believe we can get close. https://t.co/69MSMUqRk7 Technology is not an end in itself. What matters is how we use it to enhance people\u2019s opportunities.  As @melindagates writes in @CNN,  that\u2019s where the magic happens. https://t.co/Ddv2TyqM71 In a country where most people were uneasy discussing sex, Mechai Viravaidya pushed the conversation out into the open. Thanks to his efforts, Thailand became one of the first countries to achieve a decline in HIV infections: https://t.co/aODfPs5Hcj https://t.co/7238ZgMMN5 When people in Thailand want a condom, they don\u2019t call it a condom. Instead, they refer to it by the name of the man who taught them the importance of using one: https://t.co/RNQfVEqfSi https://t.co/EI7hGVvYYU Rwanda\u2019s health system has become a model for other nations to follow. The country\u2019s example should inspire all leaders to renew their commitments to primary health care. #Astana2018 https://t.co/qox6K2iHmv In his home country, \u201cThe Condom King\u201d doesn\u2019t need an introduction. Mechai Viravaidya\u2019s extraordinary life and work in global health has helped improve the lives of millions of people in Thailand. https://t.co/eAZJc4L490 A polio-free future is within reach. @TVAshleigh is hosting @Rotary\u2019s #WorldPolioDay event to highlight the road ahead. Here\u2019s how to tune-in now. https://t.co/abAXLV1YvQ We must take bold steps to end polio for good. Two of the leaders of in this effort, @RotaryRassin and @DrTedros, share what it will take to finish the job. #WorldPolioDay https://t.co/jpzfkWDJs3 As long as polio exists anywhere, it is a threat to children everywhere. The progress that we\u2019ve made is thanks to the heroic efforts of health workers, governments, partners, and donors who are working to reach every child. \n#WorldPolioDay https://t.co/LGud5DlJPh Few people tell stories as well as Melinda. Whenever she gets back from a trip, I always love hearing her talk about the places she went and the people she met. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m excited about her new book. https://t.co/ggHhdgjZ2Z I try to visit India at least once a year, and every time I\u2019m excited by something new that our foundation\u2019s partners are working on. Here are a few notable updates from the @BMGFIndia team: https://t.co/L9z2UqzV4x #StrongerTogether https://t.co/UhuY9eFdLW Over the next year, I will be writing a lot about the effort to stop climate change.

Here\u2019s why I\u2019m voting @Yeson1631 and why I\u2019m encouraging my fellow Washingtonians to do the same. https://t.co/JdjctyHaDG If all the cattle in the world joined together to start their own country, they would be the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Here are four more mind-blowing facts about climate change: https://t.co/xQoZN49JRQ https://t.co/m45HNVmWIG We need the world\u2019s brightest minds working on preventing the worst effects of climate change. I\u2019m placing my bets in five key areas: https://t.co/GxDk4orF6D https://t.co/i3K7L9SpFF How many drivers would have to switch to electric cars to equal the annual emissions saved by replacing one coal power plant with a nuclear plant? Check your answer here and see if you can beat my score on the rest of this climate change quiz: https://t.co/v0qc5jdOWE I\u2019m in Brussels this week to sign an agreement between Breakthrough Energy and the @EU_Commission. We\u2019re creating a pilot fund that will invest \u20ac100 million in European companies working to stop climate change. https://t.co/3PrAa4Wsky Paul deserved more time in life. He would have made the most of it. I will miss him tremendously. https://t.co/npPAjGCCsc Creativity is how the younger generations will solve the world\u2019s toughest problems. What will you create? #HourOfCode https://t.co/sUIuABm8Dm https://t.co/iOJu2WhHvR The balloon that helped me take this selfie could help us win the fight against poverty. Here\u2019s how it works: https://t.co/Yq6wgfU2LJ https://t.co/J0CjMypnrT Data can help farmers improve their yields and increase their incomes. A team of amazing researchers has developed a series of innovations that might one day put -changing information in the hands of even the poorest farmers: https://t.co/7Lgo9vncyg https://t.co/hmvt0Ma9g3 Of all the things I\u2019ve discussed with @reidhoffman, one of the most thought-provoking might be blitzscaling. I\u2019m glad Reid and @chrisyeh are sharing their insights on how to start and scale companies in their new book. https://t.co/O5BVi8kWuy I just shared a new list on @Likewise. These books make me optimistic about the world and help me understand the role of innovation in driving progress. https://t.co/SVqGlLdBUp The leadership of @narendramodi and the Indian government has played an important role in improving sanitation. Now is the time to build on the success of @swachhbharat. https://t.co/HKXapJxQ3x I\u2019ve been traveling to African countries regularly for more than two decades. I wish others could come along so they could see what I see: a young continent filled with optimism and innovation. https://t.co/KpiyxW1euw Clean energy is one of the smartest investments our country can make. @ARPAE is leading the way with some exciting new investments in energy storage. https://t.co/sWVBfMGOUL Congratulations to @DenisMukwege on receiving this year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize. He and his team have helped more than 50,000 survivors of sexual violence rebuild their lives. https://t.co/VMmtWmshxM Congratulations to @NadiaMuradBasee on receiving this year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize.

I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work with him on many occasions.

Here\u2019s my review: https://t.co/7VU7i8wvPA The portion of the global economy that doesn\u2019t fit the old model just keeps getting larger. But the rules that govern the economy haven\u2019t kept up. This is one of the biggest trends in the global economy that isn\u2019t getting enough attention. Unlike the goods that powered our economy in the past, software is an intangible asset -- \u201csomething you can\u2019t touch.\u201d And it\u2019s not the only example: data, insurance, e-books, even movies work in similar ways. But software doesn\u2019t work like this. Microsoft might spend a lot of money to develop the first unit of a new program, but every unit after that is virtually free to produce. This chart assumes that the total cost of production increases as supply increases. When a car company makes a new vehicle, the 10th car costs the same to manufacture as the 1000th. At the time I was in college, this was basically how the global economy worked... https://t.co/2polaSbsXY My friend @PaulGAllen's @LivingComputers Museum &amp; Lab is a great place to learn about the tech revolution and what will come next. (It also has a working Altair 8800 \u2013 very cool) https://t.co/bxtBhEREhE One in five students who plan to attend college don\u2019t actually enroll. @GeorgiaStateU, a school I visited last year, used chatbots to reduce \u201csummer melt\u201d by 21%: https://t.co/OatrCs5Z54 https://t.co/G99itf15dO Congrats to @PearlJam on bringing together so many incredible partners and fans to fight homelessness in my hometown of Seattle.

Creating a zero-carbon future will take time, which is all the more reason to get started now. But I am more optimistic than he is. I think innovation\u2014and the urgency brought on by climate change\u2014will speed up the process when it comes to clean energy. Smil is absolutely right that the transition to clean energy will not happen overnight. Here is a chart showing that energy transitions can take many decades. https://t.co/2vV4tB2E9Z Vaclav Smil is one of my favorite authors. I\u2019ve read nearly all of his 37 books. This is an excellent overview of how Smil has helped shape how people (myself included) think about energy. https://t.co/FEOkVkVyaH Ironman triathlete and polio survivor @mindadentler\u2019s story is incredible.

Hans and two family members wrote it at the end of his life, and it\u2019s a wonderful summary of everything he stood for. Here\u2019s my full review. https://t.co/vwU2a21ZYW I use this one all the time: \u201cBig numbers always look big. Small numbers on their own are misleading\u2026 Always look for comparisons.\u201d https://t.co/nl9VK3t2iP \u201cSlow change is still change.\u201d Extreme poverty has gone down by an average 2.5% per year in the last two decades. Over time, that adds up to a 50% drop. https://t.co/3lymk8bjgX \u201cGive the system some credit.\u201d It\u2019s great to celebrate heroes (I do!). But there were heroes 1,000 years ago, and life was awful. Modernity\u2014being able to flush the toilet and turn on the lights\u2014is a miracle of systems plus heroes. https://t.co/c92VUmlbjP \u201cThings can be both better and bad.\u201d This is the heart of our foundation\u2019s work. It\u2019s bad that 5 million children die every year\u2014but it\u2019s better than it was, which is why I think it can keep improving. https://t.co/hcYm3u0kX1 \u201cFactfulness,\u201d by the late Hans Rosling, is one of the best books I\u2019ve read in a long time. It\u2019s a great guide to thinking clearly about the world. Here are some of my favorite tips\u2026 https://t.co/0TfEtVqNof It\u2019s hard to pick up on progress if you divide the world into developed countries and developing countries. In his newly-released book, Hans Rosling offers a better framework. You can download a free excerpt here\u2026 https://t.co/lK4xtl4DeV Good news: the world\u2019s newest country reported zero cases of Guinea worm in 2017 and hasn\u2019t had a case in 15 months. https://t.co/uOo4MMEtFm My family loved talking about this book at the dinner table, and I think yours will, too. https://t.co/vVqVFlTSG0 It was great to visit @MSFTResearch TechFest.

We talked about how his own experiences have played a big role in shaping his approach: https://t.co/mPpyfMv3x6 https://t.co/a7wfliF5Gj Developing affordable, clean energy for all is one of the smartest public investments our country can make. We need lots of innovation to get there, and @ARPAE is leading the way: https://t.co/thKFCIsq6o #ARPAE18 I feel lucky to have known Stephen Hawking. His work is an inspiring reminder of what human minds are capable of. I often meet with educators who have creative ideas about how to make school systems work for every child.

This is a great conversation with @EasterbrookG about his new book, \u201cIt\u2019s Better Than It Looks.\u201d https://t.co/ou4UdXuqnU The evidence is clear: if you want to empower women and girls, give them the power to decide what to do with their own money. #IWD2018 https://t.co/YO5gJ6f7Zl Tomorrow is #IWD2018 \u2014 a day when the world celebrates the progress made by and for women.
