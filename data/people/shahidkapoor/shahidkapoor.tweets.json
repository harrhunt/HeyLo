Thank you for this. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udc95 Need your love and best wishes. Thank you for everything. The appreciation and the criticism. I am because of you. Keep it real. And always make it count. Big love. And the duality of the human existence is its most challenging aspect and it\u2019s most fascinating contradiction. I find strength in weak characters. And vulnerability in strong ones. That\u2019s the tastiest part of the dish. Hope I can find truth in this new journey. Of finding the soul of a protagonist who\u2019s story merits being told. Every character if real will be flawed in some way. Some more than others. The beauty of life and humanity lies in its acceptance of its own imperfection. Thank you all for all the concern and wishes. Last 2 weeks I was out of action but am well and raring to go now. #Jersey shoot starts tomorrow.  As usual pre shoot nervousness. Sleepless and anxious. Every character is a new challenge. And the responsibility of finding truth. https://t.co/rncBeiAeHx BOOM !! Nuf said \ud83d\ude4c #jersey #prep https://t.co/0huoKgK0Wo Pleasure to have you on board.

And at the end just felt for the kiwis. England played amazing cricket. But so did the kiwis. They didn\u2019t deserve to be second.  No way. This World Cup should have been shared. If England got more boundaries. New Zealand took more wickets. So the criteria is absurd. All 22 of those boys gave their everything and no one was lesser. Then why do only 11 get to feel like they were the best. \ud83e\udd2a https://t.co/juEKjRk61P Yeah baby. https://t.co/UTBSwvuN9c When you top the table you prove you are the best in the world.

Prefers running around outside the d Another underdog Algeria making Germany sweat it out Van persie's header and James Rodriguez's goal against Uruguay are the goals of the World Cup for me so far . Mexico n chile .. My heart goes out to them .. This World Cup the underdogs are killing it and I'm loving it. Morning all Ramadan Mubarak to all . Sometimes life just gives it to you and it feels good . But when you EARN it it makes you a man . Just saying. Shabbakhair all Neymar Neymar neymar ....... Insane match ...... Loving the energy The only difference between Iran and Argentina today was the genius of messi and now Ghana and Germany tied ....
