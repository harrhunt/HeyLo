Let\u2019s run it up!!! #Detroit2 https://t.co/qlc6B1BQhE I don\u2019t know if my album Detroit 2 is goin #1 or not, that would be crazy if it did, but I feel like it\u2019s already #1 to me because all I put into it, what I went through to make it and the impact it\u2019s had on some of you. I\u2019m too grateful for that alone! When I see someone say \u201cyou was speaking to me\u201d or people being inspired in some way even if it\u2019s just to turn the fuck up n go get it, it makes me feel incredible because that was my goal, in my heart that\u2019s what I hoped for. That\u2019s why stayed so late every night for \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe To the fans, listeners, even other artist who feel me through the music, or share it, or mention it on their platforms have inspired me to be more supportive of art and speak up. I feel a sense of community in music and less competition and that feels amazing! So thank you! I couldn\u2019t rush it. I listened to God and myself for when the time was right. That\u2019s one of the hardest things to do as an artist was be on my time, and not the time everyone kept telling me is right for me. I had to learn MY timing isn\u2019t everyone else\u2019s timing n that\u2019s fine. While I was working on me and figuring things out (still am everyday but I just mean while I was making the album) I was worried that it was taking too long, and adding extra stress to my life worrying if people will even still want to hear from me, but even then I still... That\u2019s the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to learn how to do, I pray if and when it happens to you, you just hold on to your faith! You may discover more passions if it\u2019s meant to be as well. Not sure if we are only meant to do one thing in life, who knows for sure... I thought doing what I loved would always make me happy and satisfied, so when I got tired of it, I was confused and it drove me insane. Later i realized I was just growing n had to gain a new mentality and foundation on many levels n re-discover my passion! And try new things.. I don\u2019t feel like this currently, but I had never gone through wanting to kill myself, give up on my life until the past few years and I didn\u2019t realize how important it was to embrace the ups n downs of life and enjoy (in joy) taking active steps to better it. it\u2019s the Journey! Lotta things I learned making this album... I feel a like I should share a couple on my heart, a lot of it is in the music tho. Feel like I\u2019m finna tweet a lot right now \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I had people in my circle but they wasn\u2019t in my corner, I had people IN my business but they didn\u2019t support it... @WayofWillis For some reason the Vinylz are backed up man, factory production or something like that.

But when you work on yourself and bring your best self to something, I believe that\u2019s truly how to experience a love where you are bringing happiness and joy and not dependency. There\u2019s beauty in being your own source of happiness and fun and working on yourself. That\u2019s the process I been going through personally and it can be a scary thing. I never knew that I didn\u2019t know how to be alone in life. I always would find so much joy n happiness in a relationship or being with friends, but I didn\u2019t know how important it was to be in a relationship with yourself. Listen to your heart, it truly speaks to you! That\u2019s something I didn\u2019t always do even when I knew better I think at one point I stopped having fun with life and it became a burden, I know a lot of you feel that way too, if I felt that way doing what I always dreamed of. It\u2019s not suppose to feel like that and if it is then change it. @Jenn_19_ She\u2019s amazing! I didn\u2019t fumble anything but I can see from how things can look from the outside looking in. It\u2019s all love though, that\u2019s what you don\u2019t understand I been gone for awhile and barely on the internet, I learned so much about myself... I feel way more spiritually grounded. For the first time in my life I 100% believe in myself and that\u2019s something I\u2019m so happy I got to achieve in this lifetime... I appreciate the love on my Overtime freestyle, I just wanted to drop some bars n have fun... thanks for listening RT @Spotify: Sean Don back \ud83d\ude4f\nListen to @BigSean's #Overtime right now https://t.co/RHLWnvpYlT https://t.co/tMP6sYVb8e RT @pandoramusic: \u201c'Overtime' is me going back to my roots, my Detroit stomping grounds,\" says @BigSean of his brand new single.

Everyday a dream come true\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe#IDecided. I wanted to keep the signing going but the store shut it down. Sorry it got ruined for the rest of the real fans He claimed he had wrote songs for Michael Jackson, Jay Z n was wit Birdman etc. I'm hoping he's getting the proper treatment he needs. the dude was released from a mental hospital last week, has a long record of mental illness n was off his meds. Very serious issues some guy waited in line in the cold since 10am, bought my CD, when I signed his CD n shook his hand he TRIED to hit me off guard Look I never comment on this type of shit but they can't do me dirty and say a fan smacked me or no shit like that.
