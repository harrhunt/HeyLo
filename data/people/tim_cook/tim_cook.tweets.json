We feel a duty to channel grief into action, and we hold to the hope that a single soul may yet change the world. Minneapolis is grieving for a reason. To paraphrase Dr. King, the negative peace which is the absence of tension is no substitute for the positive peace which is the presence of justice. Justice is how we heal. Larry Kramer was an American original who got loud, acted up, and saved many LGBTQ lives. His unrelenting efforts won\u2019t be forgotten and should be held up as an example of a timeless truth: \u201cthe one thing that doesn\u2019t abide by majority rule is a person\u2019s conscience.\u201d We will never forget the memory and sacrifice of those who have given their lives to protect our freedoms. And it is up to all of us, as Lincoln said, to be dedicated to the unfinished work which they so nobly advanced. #MemorialDay Wishing safety, happiness and peace to those celebrating Eid al-Fitr around the world \u2014 especially those who\u2019ve been unable to share these special moments in person with their loved ones this year. #EidMubarak!

This tribute to the late Grammy Award-winning jazz legend Roy Hargrove, sketched on the new iPad Pro by @rob_zilla_iii, is one of my favorites. https://t.co/nx3OKpaUFi Wishing everyone a Happy #Diwali\u2060\u2060! May we all strive for peace, prosperity and the triumph of light over darkness. These beautiful photos were #shotoniphoneXR by @ashishjparmar https://t.co/cDkyukpY2B \"The best, most powerful, most capable iPads I\u2019ve ever used.\" - @WIRED https://t.co/wwuhodRG5T What a \ub530\ub73b\ud55c welcome for iPhone XR, iPhone XS and Apple Watch Series 4 in Korea this weekend! \uace0\ub9d9\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4!

We\u2019re looking forward to an exciting day at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. See you in a few hours! https://t.co/MvyyAemoIj Great to be back in NYC. See you tomorrow morning in Brooklyn! #shotoniphoneXR https://t.co/98XxwjMMAw On this Sunday morning, let us remember the words of Martin Luther King, \u201cDarkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.\u201d Our hearts are with the Tree of Life community, first responders and the families of those tragically lost in Pittsburgh today. We must reject intolerance and hate if we are ever to find peace in our world. After 20 years, Matthew Shepard is going to his final resting place\u2014where his life will be celebrated, his loss mourned and his memory preserved. An important reminder that darkness may win temporary victories, but light will always find a way to shine. Buongiorno Piazza Liberty! Milan is one of my favorite cities and I am very happy to be here with you today. Around the world, we hope everyone is enjoying the new iPhone XR! https://t.co/hmJb8yrNCM Our teams here in Madrid and all around the world are gearing up for Friday\u2019s launch of iPhone XR. Thanks for stopping by, @rosaliavt! https://t.co/3YsBkNo8bB La m\u00fasica corre por nuestras venas. Thank you for making HomePod\u2019s launch in Spain extra special, @rosaliavt!  Your new album is phenomenal. https://t.co/VnJARrgV9X Technology is capable of doing great things. But it doesn\u2019t want to do great things. It doesn\u2019t want anything. That part takes all of us. We are optimistic about technology\u2019s awesome potential for good \u2014 but we know that it won\u2019t happen on its own. And fourth, everyone has a right to the security of their data. Security is at the heart of all data privacy and privacy rights. Third, companies should recognize that data belongs to users and we should make it easy for people to get a copy of their personal data, as well as correct and delete it. Second, users should always know what data is being collected from them and what it\u2019s being collected for. This is the only way to empower users to decide what collection is legitimate and what isn\u2019t. Anything less is a sham. First, companies should challenge themselves to de-identify customer data or not collect that data in the first place. We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right. No matter what country you live in, that right should be protected in keeping with four essential principles: GDPR has shown us all that good policy and political will can come together to protect the rights of everyone. It was an honor to be invited to #ICDPPC2018 in Brussels this morning. I\u2019d like to share a bit of what I said to this gathering of privacy regulators from around the world. It all boils down to a fundamental question: What kind of world do we want to live in? Proud to announce our new training program in partnership with France\u2019s @simplonco, teaching the basics of coding with Swift. Learning to code unlocks a world of creativity and potential. Thanks to the staff and trainees for a warm welcome this morning!\nhttps://t.co/e0xpnhA1NO A profoundly moving visit to @aartistesenexil in Paris.

We send our deepest condolences to Paul\u2019s friends, the Allen family and everyone at Microsoft. Apple is standing with our friends and neighbors in the Gulf Coast region, and will be donating to recovery and relief efforts. I grew up on the shores of the Gulf Coast, near Pensacola and Mobile, and that region holds a special place in my heart. That\u2019s never been more true than now. To all those communities in the path of Hurricane Michael, you are in my prayers. Please stay safe. Teachers around the world inspire us every day.
