He knows Bayern's strengths from his time in Germany and expects another difficult game. \n\nThat's all from Toni. More from him and Lampard online and on the app soon. #BAYCHE Rudiger says Callum Hudson-Odoi is a young guy with loads of talent who wants to play in big games like these and prove a point. #BAYCHE Rudiger recognises we have conceded too many goals this season and he says analysis of how we can improve will continue after the season ends. He says the recovery period between seasons will be unusual but the players will be ready for whenever the next one starts. #BAYCHE Rudiger starts by saying Chelsea 'have nothing to lose and the pressure is not on our side. That can be something good for us.' #BAYCHE That's all from the boss. We'll be hearing from Toni Rudiger next!\n\n#BAYCHE Frank says he will speak to the players to make them aware they have an opportunity to show, act and believe they can turn this tie around. He believes it is a one-off game for them to do something special and they must feel they can do it.\n\n#BAYCHE Lampard on Willian: 'He remains our player. He was injured for the FA Cup final and he's injured for tomorrow but he would have given everything to play those games.'\n\n#BAYCHE Frank says he believes we can turn around this 3-0 deficit against Bayern Munich but reiterates we will have to be at our very best to do it.\n\n#BAYCHE Lampard reports that Pulisic and Azpilicueta's hamstring injuries are likely to keep them out for between three and six weeks, while the outgoing Pedro had an operation earlier in the week on his shoulder injury.\n\n#BAYCHE It's Frank up first and he starts with an injury update on the squad. 'Pulisic, Azpi, Pedro and Willian are all out.

Lampard finishes by saying he has great respect for David Luiz, and recalls the amazing feeling of winning the Champions League with him in 2012. \n\nThat's all from the boss for now. More online and on the app shortly. Thanks for following.\n\n #HeadsUpFACupFinal Lampard isn't sure if it is a positive or a negative that Arsenal have the added incentive of securing Europa League football next season if they win. From the outside, the boss has been impressed by Mikel Arteta's impact since he took over. #HeadsUpFACupFinal Lampard has no doubts Willian will give everything tomorrow, whatever his future. He says the Brazilian's attitude since restart has been fantastic, and he expects more of the same should he play tomorrow. #HeadsUpFACupFinal Lampard says it will be a big boost for his young players if we win tomorrow, but he notes 'the experience of a Cup final is an experience anyway. You improve with the more finals you play.' He won't be heaping pressure on his squad before kick-off. #HeadsUpFACupFinal Lampard says his selection tomorrow will be difficult. He knows how keen players are to be involved in games such as these, but he says the group must stick together and try and win together. #HeadsUpFACupFinal Lampard says it will be different tomorrow without fans, and he is sad they won't be there, but he is focused on winning silverware for them and the club. He expects a very tough match against a side who showed their ability in the semi-final. #HeadsUpFACupFinal Lampard starts with injury news, and reports N'Golo Kante and Willian are in the squad. 'We will see if they are fit to be in the starting XI'. \n\nThere is less good news on Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who is out after picking up a knock in training yesterday.\n\n#HeadsUpFACupFinal Two more guests at #CupFinalFest...\n\n@TimoWerner and @billygilmourrr! \n\nDon't miss it! \ud83d\udc4a \ud83c\udf99 Frank Lampard's #HeadsUpFACupFinal press conference will be taking place at 1.30pm (UK) today!

The Spaniard was serenaded in the dressing room afterwards, and Lampard is grateful for his professionalism and quality throughout this season. #CHEWOL Lampard says Azpilicueta has set the standard this season, and leads by example every day. The boss then thanks the Chelsea support, who he wishes could have been here today to celebrate a good end to the league campaign. #CHEWOL Lampard says Giroud 'has to take all of the credit' for his performances since January. 'He has always been big in the training ground and the dressing room, players love playing with him, so I'm delighted to have him'. #CHEWOL Lampard believes finishing in the top four should help recruitment for next season, but for now he is focusing on Arsenal next Saturday. #CHEWOL Lampard says the players deserve credit for securing us a top-four finish. The boss is quick to complement the experienced players as well as the younger ones who have burst onto the scene this season. 'We should be happy with what we have achieved'. #CHEWOL Lampard says Mason Mount will continue to get better, and deserved to score today for a fantastic performance that summed Chelsea up. #CHEWOL Lampard starts by praising his side's 'spirit and professionalism', saying we 'saw out a job that was potentially very difficult'. He hopes the watching Timo Werner will have seen the 'talent, resilience, and unity' in the squad. #CHEWOL The thoughts of Frank Lampard coming next! \ud83d\ude03\n\n#CHEWOL https://t.co/AjWthHFZub Man of the match for you today? \ud83e\udd14\n\n#CHEWOL Mason knew... \ud83d\ude09\n\n#CHEWOL https://t.co/tfKkWdc9vv Full-time: Champions League football secured! \ud83d\ude4c\n\n#CHEWOL https://t.co/uxRh0unx2c It's almost a third!

Thanks for following. #LIVCHE Lampard notes inconsistency generally comes when teams are in a process, like Liverpool were a few years ago. The boss strongly believes that will come with hard work. He adds qualifying for the Champions League was the number one goal at the start of this season. #LIVCHE Lampard says we still have to go 'a long way' before we can consider ourselves title contenders, particularly when you factor in the consistency shown by Liverpool in the league this season, and Man City in the last two seasons. #LIVCHE Lampard says Callum Hudson-Odoi has made a good impact off the bench in the last two games and he wants to see the youngster continue working hard in training and going on to fulfil his potential at Chelsea. #LIVCHE Speaking from experience, Lampard says playing after you have won the Premier League 'does change the face of it', but he is only thinking about the strong Liverpool that have won the Premier League with so much time to spare. #LIVCHE We want \ud835\ude06\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02 to choose the cover page for each of the four home matches featured in our collectors' edition Project Restart programme! \ud83d\udcd6\n\nHere's the first poll, for last month's win over Man City...

He also praises the midfield contribution by Kovacic today.\n#MUNCHE Lampard says there was no plan to shoot from distance against De Gea as he has great respect for the Man United keeper, but he did speak to Mount at half-time about shooting more and striking through the ball. \n#MUNCHE Frank Lampard says it is a great achievement to make the FA Cup final but the most important thing is to win that final.

I want to talk about focus rather than bottle.'\n\n#CHENOR Frank says ideally we would have scored more goals tonight but the games are so intense at the minute so we are just happy to take the three points.

Thanks for following. #CRYCHE The boss also credits the impact made by his strikers Olivier Giroud and Tammy Abraham for their goals today. He says it will be great for Tammy's confidence as he hadn't scored since the restart. #CRYCHE Lampard starts by saying his team should have managed the game better, especially at 2-0 up and then again in the final stages when we led 3-2.

He says the tactical reasons behind team selection remain between him and the players.\n\n#CRYCHE Asked about whether the drinks breaks are being used as tactical interventions by coaches, Lampard responds: 'As a coach, you try to use it if you can because any moments to speak to player in a game are precious.'\n\n#CRYCHE Frank believes Manchester United are the biggest threat from behind us in the table as they have plenty of quality individual players and are gaining momentum. However, he states our emphasis remains on us and our performances.\n\n#CRYCHE Lampard starts with an injury update ahead of Palace: 'Kante won't be in the squad - he has a low-level hamstring injury so it will be a week or so hopefully.'

There will be more on our app and website later this afternoon. Thanks for following!\n\n#WHUCHE Lampard acknowledges that Werner and Ziyech will officially become Chelsea players tomorrow: 'We're in the process of making plans. Hakim has not played for a long time and Timo finished at the weekend so it will look slightly different for them individually.'\n\n#WHUCHE On N'Golo Kante's midfield role, Frank says it cannot be compared to that of Claude Makelele because he is asking him to do more than just sit in front of the back four, citing his capacity to make plenty of high-intensity runs and be fluid in the middle of the pitch.\n\n#WHUCHE Lampard: 'Lockdown gave me some really good reflection time on how we can improve.' The boss adds that the team can always be more clinical in front of goal but we have been scoring more regularly and we need to keep that up.\n\n#WHUCHE Frank accepts that it will take time for players to get that extra five per cent of sharpness back after so long without football: 'We've had great buy-in from the players in terms of working hard and the physical numbers.'\n\n#WHUCHE Lampard: 'I'm happy with elements of the games we've played, particularly the first two, and that must continue. I was disappointed with the performance at Leicester but when you reflect on a 1-0 win then that's a positive.'\n\n#WHUCHE On transfer reports, Frank says Man United youngster Angel Gomes has not been mentioned in his plans. He is also asked about West Ham's Declan Rice but repeats a familiar line that he doesn't want to talk about players at other clubs.\n\n#WHUCHE Lampard starts by reporting on the fitness of his squad.  'Christian Pulisic had a tightness in his calf when he came off at Leicester, which we're managing. It feels better than it did but we'll see tomorrow.' Andreas Christensen's fitness is also being monitored. \n\n#WHUCHE Frank Lampard's #WHUCHE press conference will start at 1pm (UK time), and you can tune in live on the Chelsea app and our website. \ud83d\udc4d @RefugeCharity @NHSCharities @PlanUK .@CesarAzpi: \u2018Our fans have once again shown that their support for our communities is as strong as it is for the team.' \ud83d\udc4f https://t.co/b7tPPsEbwy .@cpulisic_10 \ud83d\udc4f https://t.co/vPmDs7Q92N https://t.co/qQfNo0TlLG We signed Deco from Barcelona #onthisday in 2008! \ud83d\ude80 https://t.co/BRaL2kSxz7 West Ham tomorrow! \ud83d\udc4a\n\n#WHUCHE https://t.co/uUMGEYUMw1 Chelsea supporters have helped raise an incredible \u00a3600k for @RefugeCharity, @NHSCharities and @PlanUK! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc99 If you missed yesterday's FA Cup quarter-final win - have a watch of this! \ud83d\udc4a https://t.co/cYVf6FWQha .@RBarkley8 reveals the reason why the FA Cup has always meant so much to him... \ud83c\udfc6 .@cpulisic_10 right now... \ud83d\udd25 https://t.co/xGMG3tVt9D https://t.co/rT41MivTWX Typical. https://t.co/e6Yat1Zc25 .@nglkante v Leicester... \n\nNo player spent more time in possession (7.3 per cent), no player had more touches than his 87, and nobody completed more passes than him either (61).\n\n\ud83d\udd25 https://t.co/MTsavPv72D .@RBarkley8 reveals what the boss said to him at half-time yesterday, before coming on and grabbing the winner! \ud83d\udc4f https://t.co/0rTrBH07o4 Take a bow, @RBarkley8 and @willianborges88! \ud83d\udc4f https://t.co/sGN509CKnO The boss talks us through yesterday's big win, and provides an update on injuries... \u2692 v \ud83d\udd35\n\n#MondayMotivation https://t.co/uubwaegaln It's Man Utd next for the Blues in the FA Cup - our 25th visit to the new Wembley! \ud83c\udfdf https://t.co/75IGkB2ruf WWW https://t.co/QY2RR8aD9Y RT @emersonpalmieri: To the #FACup semi-final!

'Christian felt a tightness in his calf in the second drinks break, hopefully nothing that keeps him out. Andreas had a problem with his hip yesterday.'\n\nThat's all from Lampard's post-match reaction.\n\n#LEICHE Lampard praises match-winner Barkley's attitude and application, not just today but over the last few months. 'He can score goals, he can shoot with both feet, he makes the box. He's a big player for us.'\n\n#LEICHE Frank insists the triple substitution was not about teaching individuals a lesson because the performance from the team was lethargic. He doesn't feel he will have to address the issue with them moving forward.\n\n#LEICHE Lampard says he made changes at half-time to add urgency and intensity following a first-half performance he was not pleased with. He feels he could have made more but is happy with the reaction.\n\n#LEICHE We'll be hearing from Frank shortly...\n\n#LEICHE https://t.co/WYD7XYnARS RT @EmiratesFACup: Congratulations, @ChelseaFC \ud83d\udc4f\n\nSee you in the #EmiratesFACup semi-final! https://t.co/eOj5enqM4q Impact. \ud83d\udc4f\n\n#LEICHE https://t.co/M1ZP5sxrdm \ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc-\ud835\uddd9\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf\ud835\udde6, \ud835\udddb\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\uddea\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8! \ud83d\udd25\n\n#LEICHE https://t.co/YwJG5CPmNX Four minutes added time!\n\n\ud83e\udd8a 0-1 \ud83d\udd35 [90'] #LEICHE Soyuncu heads over from close range.

There will be more on our website and app later this afternoon.\n\n#AVLCHE Lampard reports that Ruben Loftus-Cheek is physically fit and has looked good in training ahead of the season restart. The midfielder hasn't played yet this campaign but is available for selection this weekend.\n\n#AVLCHE Frank says he will be without two players this weekend. 'Tomori has a muscle injury, maybe due to the stresses of getting fit quickly, and is out for 10 days. Hudson-Odoi had a small injury earlier on and is not match fit, albeit he is physically fit.'\n\n#AVLCHE Lampard reports that talks with Pedro and Willian regarding short-term contract extensions until the end of the season are continuing. 'They're ongoing and we have until next week to find a solution. It will be good to finish the season with the squad we started with.'\n\n#AVLCHE Lampard insists his team will not play with the handbrake on: 'We have to go full throttle no matter what game it is in terms of giving it everything. It won't be easy but we need to be focused and be at our best.'\n\n#AVLCHE Frank says there have been plenty of challenges in getting his players ready for the season restart and he knows it will be a unique period. 'We've trained really well and had some friendlies but nothing replicates the Premier League.'\n\n#AVLCHE Lampard on seeing John Terry again this weekend: 'We're always in contact and it's good to go up against him. I have huge respect for him as a friend but we both have big things at stake.'\n\n#AVLCHE Lampard: 'I had good conversations with Timo personally. He understands our project and what we want to do as a club. We're pleased he's decided to come to us and look forward to him joining next season.'\n\n#AVLCHE Frank Lampard begins by discussing the imminent arrival of Timo Werner. 'He's clearly a player we liked and I've followed him for a long time as a talented player. He will strengthen us, he's a huge talent and he's had a fantastic season.'\n\n#AVLCHE \ud83c\udf99 Tune in from 1.30pm (UK) to hear from the boss! 20 years ago today, @Eidur22Official became a Blue! \ud83d\udc99 https://t.co/VfV7gAAZL5 The wait is almost over!

'He is a personality and we need that'. #CHEEVE Lampard: 'The whole attitude and focus of the team felt really strong today after Liverpool. There was pure focus in the group. Maybe the injuries helped out in that respect. The application was spot on. Now we have to work to show we can finish the season strongly.' #CHEEVE Lampard starts by saying it was our 'most complete' performance at home this season because of the goals and the clean sheet. He adds we have had other home games like that this season when we haven't found the finishing touch.
