There will be more online and on the app shortly. Thanks for following. \n\n#CHENEW Tuchel is sure Kai Havertz will come good: 'He is totally self-aware, very humble and super talented, and I am convinced he will have a big future at this club'.\n\nTuchel adds he hopes to see Havertz back training very soon.\n\n#CHENEW Tuchel notes players like Hudson-Odoi can offer a threat from different parts of the pitch, giving us the possibility to react and be flexible. He adds the Academy is the backbone of any club and it was good to see three youngsters combine for the goal last night.\n\n#CHENEW On the busy schedule, Tuchel recognises it would have been beneficial to have more time to work with his players on the training pitch, but he has 'got to know his team better' from matches and witnessed the spirit and mentality of his squad during tricky times. \n\n#CHENEW Tuchel says he will focus on the details from last night's game and won't be too critical of his players. His job is to help them understand what they can do better ahead of what he expects to be a tough challenge from Newcastle.\n\n#CHENEW Tuchel starts with the latest team news. He confirms Christensen didn't suffer any sort of concussion last night, just a headache. Werner should be 'absolutely okay' to come back, but the game will be too soon for Thiago Silva and probably Havertz, too.\n\n#CHENEW At 11am, Thomas Tuchel will be previewing #CHENEW!\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 You can watch his press conference live on the 5th Stand app!

'We rely on them and trust them so they will be given every chance to make their steps,' he adds.\n\n#TOTCHE On being aware of Spurs as a kid, Tuchel admits he and his friends knew of them but he insists 'there is no doubt I go there tomorrow in blue and we do everything to win the game.' He says he doesn't drink a lot of alcohol but will have a gin and tonic if we win!\n\n#TOTCHE Tuchel believes Mason Mount's dedication and positive energy will help him grow into a top player: 'When you train and play with him, you are sure he gives 100% all the time. He has everything needed to reach even higher levels.'\n\n#TOTCHE Tuchel says he and his staff are working to develop bonds with each individual player in the squad to find the best conditions for them to succeed. On Werner, he believes the team need to create situations for him to attack the space in behind and utilise his speed.\n\n#TOTCHE Tuchel starts by assessing the challenge of taking on Tottenham in his first away game as Chelsea boss, stating it will be a tough test against 'a strong and competitive squad' put together by Jose Mourinho.\n\n#TOTCHE From 1.30pm (UK), Thomas Tuchel will be previewing #TOTCHE in his pre-match press conference! \ud83c\udf99\n\nWatch live on the 5th Stand and our Facebook page, or follow updates here! \ud83d\udcf2 https://t.co/TUPPUtHzLN Our #9 by Alva Skog \ud83c\udfa8 \n\nAn illustrator and graduate from Central Saint Martins, the capital's finest art school, Alva puts their spin on our striker, @TammyAbraham! \n\n#ChelseaCreates https://t.co/1k7NQH155Z Inside the mind of a wizard! \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udcad Win, lose or draw - How did Tuchel's predecessors get on in their first London derbies against Spurs? \ud83e\udd14 One-touch Rondos! \u26a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4c https://t.co/nJwtXrUikF Oops, @BillyGilmourrr! \ud83d\ude06\ud83e\udd5c https://t.co/u7j7iwxUTx \ud83d\udca5 You BEAUTY! \ud83d\udca5 @GaryJCahill\n\n#TOTCHE https://t.co/kTnlmXjZFt Get well soon Canners! \ud83d\udc99 Wednesday weights! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udfa7 @TSilva3 x @ToniRuediger #Hustle https://t.co/1YYCu6htN9 If you think you know what the score will be in Thursday's derby against Tottenham, you could win yourself a special prize... \ud83c\udf81\ud83d\udd2e #TOTCHE https://t.co/X1kCDwKPmB 'The Boys In Blue' by Alva Skog. \ud83c\udfa8\n\nIntroducing #ChelseaCreates - a collaboration with @Copa90 where we'll bring you London's finest up and coming artists over the remaining derby fixtures.

There will be plenty more from a fascinating press conference on our website and the 5th Stand app soon. Thanks for following. \n\n#WelcomeTuchel On Billy Gilmour, Tuchel says he is a 'strategic guy with a high level of understanding, and super quick with his feet and decision making'. He sees no reason for anyone in the squad to leave this month. \n\n#WelcomeTuchel Tuchel says he likes what he sees from Mount so far: 'His personality is amazing and he is such a competitive guy. He leaves his heart on the pitch and he cares for Chelsea 100 per cent. This is the best basis for big development.'\n\n#WelcomeTuchel On Kante's best position, Tuchel thinks it is in a 'double six' in the middle of the pitch where we can use his energy and his range of attributes. \n\n#WelcomeTuchel Tuchel believes the Premier League brings the best out of coaches and players, and he expects it to do the same for him as he pits his wits against the best managers in the world.\n\n#WelcomeTuchel Tuchel says it is a 'big, big challenge' to take over a team in the middle of the season, especially this one. He says we will miss the supporters in the stadium, and also because of social distancing rules at Cobham it is harder to create a bond between everyone.\n\n#WelcomeTuchel Tuchel: 'People should be excited to come to Stamford Bridge and watch our team, and see a team playing with a special kind of energy and atmosphere, but at Chelsea we play for trophies and titles, we don't hide from that.'\n\n#WelcomeTuchel Tuchel says he is happy with the squad size and adds Kante returned to training today so he has 22 outfield players to pick from. He thinks that is a good number considering our busy schedule and the fact we are in three different competitions. \n\n#WelcomeTuchel Tuchel hopes the Chelsea supporters will get behind him, and he completely understands why some will be disappointed Frank Lampard left. Tuchel reveals he received a message from Lampard today wishing him luck: 'I have the biggest respect for him and his legacy.'\n\n#WelcomeTuchel Tuchel starts by saying he 'absolutely couldn't miss the chance to join one of the biggest clubs in the world' and it was an 'easy choice'. He says he has big ambitions and his first days have been 'amazing'. \n\n#WelcomeTuchel Pass. Move.

More on our website and app shortly.\n\n#CHELUT Frank says he is grateful for the effort of fans who have expressed support for him with a new banner at Stamford Bridge. 'Everyone who knows me knows how I feel about this club so I absolutely appreciate that,' he adds.\n\n#CHELUT Lampard emphasises that the Premier League is the most physical and fastest league in the world so it's natural that new players take time to adapt, particularly when they're young. He believes it is a process that always requires time.\n\n#CHELUT On Fikayo Tomori, Lampard says there is no confirmation on any loan deal yet and he remains in the same situation.\n\n#CHELUT Frank reiterates he is only focused on what's in front of him and the team, rather than any speculation: 'I don't listen to it. I'm not stupid because I know the pressure with managing in a top job but the talk doesn't matter to me.'\n\n#CHELUT Lampard starts by saying the focus is on Sunday's game against Luton Town: 'We lost our last game, we won the one before that and we want to every game.

Football has always been a game of instinct and that's not easy to take away but we're trying to adapt.'\n\n#FULCHE Frank says he always feels pressure managing a club like Chelsea, during positive periods as well as tougher runs: 'It focuses the mind. The pressure has always been there even during our good run.'\n\n#FULCHE On the upcoming derby against Fulham, Lampard says it is an exciting fixture and one he has always felt has an extra edge to it. He notes that, while different from some other derbies, Fulham always want to beat us.\n\n#FULCHE Lampard starts with a positive update on the fitness of his squad: 'We're all good.

'They have real potential for us,' he adds.\n\nThat's all from the boss - more on our website and app later today.\n\n#CHEMOR Reflecting on recent pressure, Lampard explains that he always expected it: 'I came into this job expecting pressure. I never expected an easy run, coming to a big club in the process of a rebuild. That was never going to be easy.'\n\n#CHEMOR Frank: 'The FA Cup has a magic that's been there forever, which means underdogs will turn up and cause you problems. If we play well and do our job, I believe we will win but we have to respect Morecambe.'\n\n#CHEMOR Lampard reiterates there are concerns because of the current climate of the pandemic but none of his players have tested positive in recent testing. He praises the club's medical staff for going above and beyond to help keep everyone safe.\n\n#CHEMOR On Kepa, Frank says the goalkeeper has been training well and continues to show a positive attitude around the place. 'He's been brilliant and he's our player,' he adds.\n\n#CHEMOR Lampard will not be drawn on his starting line-up for the Cup tie but reveals a number of young players have been training with the group due to changes in the Covid bubble rules, which is a big plus, and some may be involved against Morecambe.\n\n#CHEMOR The boss starts with an update on those that might be involved on Sunday and says Reece James, Andreas Christensen and N'Golo Kante are all out: 'Reece will train with us tomorrow but this game is too soon. N'Golo has a minor hamstring injury.'\n\n#CHEMOR Frank Lampard will be speaking to the press ahead of #CHEMOR at 1:30pm (UK) today.\n\ud83d\udcf2 Watch it live on the Chelsea app! #OTD in 2012 \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f\nA Ramires double on the way to a 4-0 win against Portsmouth in the @EmiratesFACup \ud83d\udc4a\nWho remembers this match? https://t.co/25BAFs8ohC #ICYMI \ud83d\udca5\n90 Seconds with Jorginho is here \ud83d\udc47 https://t.co/w2DYU6O0CR \ud83d\udca5 GOAL OF THE MONTH \ud83d\udca5\n\nWhich of these gets your vote in our December GOTM?

That is all the news from the boss here for now. \n#ARSCHE Returning to the subject of Werner, Lampard says the player's honesty in what he has said about his form is a good thing, even if it gets taken in the wrong context. \n#ARSCHE Lampard recalls that when he joined Chelsea as a player, Arsenal had the upper hand but the team he played in challenged that and a good rivalry remains. \n#ARSCHE On being in charge at a big club, Lampard explains that expectations are high but you can't control that, so you must work day to day and bring genuine positivity. \n#ARSCHE Lampard says when you play a derby match, form goes out the window and he is expecting Arsenal to be at their best on Boxing Day, which is a good attacking team. \n#ARSCHE On Timo Werner being on a run of not scoring, Lampard says the goals will come as he is getting in the places to have chances. \n#ARSCHE Frank Lampard reports Ben Chilwell and Reece James are both doubtful for the next two games. \n#ARSCHE From 1.30pm (UK), Frank Lampard will look ahead to #ARSCHE in his pre-match press conference! \ud83c\udf99\n\nWatch it live on the 5th Stand app and our Facebook page or follow updates here on Twitter! https://t.co/0jVKfNIo9i Hi, @_OlivierGiroud_! \ud83d\udc4c https://t.co/qAqMAz86uw Pitch side views of Chelsea 3-0 West Ham... \ud83e\udd29\ud83c\udfa5 At the Emirates last season... \ud83d\ude0d @TammyAbraham https://t.co/YaXnmUQ1Ig There's a VIP Matchday Experience courtesy of @CarabaoUK behind door 2\ufe0f\u20e33\ufe0f\u20e3! \ud83d\ude32\n\nCan you find the right answer to today's question to be in with a chance of winning?

He says as a player the fixture meant more to him, but now as a manager it is just another game.\n\n#CHEWHU Lampard says it would have been really beneficial for player welfare if five subs had been approved, but he recognises the decision has been made and we must carry on as we were.\n\n#CHEWHU The boss starts with an injury update, and reports Ziyech and Hudson-Odoi are back training with the team for the first time today. He will have to see where they're at on Monday before he makes a decision for West Ham.
