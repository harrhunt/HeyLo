Officials passed a plan giving top priority to people living in 11 ZIP codes where COVID infections and deaths had been most heavily concentrated. \n\nBut, the state and other local officials rejected the plan. https://t.co/AlrmfnXIIy 5/ In February, local organizations in predominantly Black and Latino areas of South Dallas stepped up to help their communities get vaccinated. \n\nThe T.R.

In June, immigration lawyer @taylorklevy, along with a midwife and several community organizers in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, launched the project Las Zadas (short for embarazadas, meaning \u201cpregnant\u201d in Spanish), to try to keep pregnant asylum seekers from falling through the cracks. Over the course of two years, there have potentially been thousands of women arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border who are pregnant, or became pregnant while they waited to cross into the U.S. The Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) has kept more than 71,000 people waiting in Mexico for their asylum claim to be adjudicated in the U.S. since the policy began in January 2019.\n\nAs of Jan. 2021, an estimated 29,000 people still face active MPP cases. Title 42, a U.S. government rule, states that any migrants showing up at the border be immediately turned away to Mexico, even if they wish to make a claim for asylum, an international right. It was put in place in March 2020 due to the risks posed by COVID-19. COVID-19 worsened the humanitarian crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border.

But the legislation strictly limited who qualified, and benefits expired at the end of December. At least 58 lawsuits have been filed during the pandemic that allege an employer denied emergency parental leave, did not inform employees of their right to take emergency leave, or fired employees for asking to work remotely or take leave while schools and day cares were closed. More than 2.3 million women have dropped out of the labor force since February 2020, and 1 in 3 women cited childcare issues as the reason. Within days, she was out of a job.
