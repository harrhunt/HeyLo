All abilities to clear out where you can be hiding with no escape and it\u2019s surround by wall bangable spots. But yea it can come down to personal preference. @thamosxd @BarakLevav Camera can be used to clear sights/corners right before a hit, so disagree there. @BarakLevav Ascent really is one of the maps where if a team stacks a lane, they will win they round it they get a pick, and her alarm bot/turret allows to leave cat, mid, or A main unwatched and able to be retaken. Also means players don\u2019t need to risk jump spotting market on defense. @BarakLevav At a super high level brother, Jetts omens and brimstones will smoke the turret out @BarakLevav Cypher camera, cages, and trips for flanks on offense Are priceless too. At a high level it\u2019s nearly impossible to use her utility on offense effectively to actually TAKE a sight besides maybe clearing a spot/corner with her molly.

DJs/artists should be utilizing live streaming platforms and getting creative with shows online (pay to watch, subscription base, ad base during breaks) instead of hosting/promoting live in person concerts. No reason to be doing live shows during this pandemic.

Age is not a barrier for competitive IMO, most people when they get older (mid-late 20s) just stop putting the time in to stay on top, when the young guns just play 18 hours a day. https://t.co/MA3Of0Dlox If you are a talented young gamer, and want to make it in the streaming/pro world, just put the #timein and you can get there.

Of course you will have some people who are rioting for selfish reasons, but that\u2019s how it starts. @DpsHeals @OmarJimenez This isn\u2019t politics this is human rights. A black reporter @OmarJimenez  gets arrested with valid media credentials while cooperating with police (all filmed live) and George\u2019s murderer is still free tells you all you need to know about America\u2019s problems.
