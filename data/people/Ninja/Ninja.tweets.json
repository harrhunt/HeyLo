All abilities to clear out where you can be hiding with no escape and it\u2019s surround by wall bangable spots. But yea it can come down to personal preference. @thamosxd @BarakLevav Camera can be used to clear sights/corners right before a hit, so disagree there. @BarakLevav Ascent really is one of the maps where if a team stacks a lane, they will win they round it they get a pick, and her alarm bot/turret allows to leave cat, mid, or A main unwatched and able to be retaken. Also means players don\u2019t need to risk jump spotting market on defense. @BarakLevav At a super high level brother, Jetts omens and brimstones will smoke the turret out @BarakLevav Cypher camera, cages, and trips for flanks on offense Are priceless too. At a high level it\u2019s nearly impossible to use her utility on offense effectively to actually TAKE a sight besides maybe clearing a spot/corner with her molly. Post plant she is 10/10 but that also requires 5-10 seconds to set up her nades and alarm Bot (if all is still available) https://t.co/NWtlWW0VbD I just got done with a 3 hour meditation session, how many @FallGuysGame did @timthetatman get today during his @NZXT PC giveaway?!?! https://t.co/BjrqeYqWv2 RT @AP: BREAKING: U.S. officials at multiple federal agencies say there are no signs of any coordinated effort to commit widespread fraud t\u2026 RT @spidadmitchell: WE DEMAND CHANGE!

DJs/artists should be utilizing live streaming platforms and getting creative with shows online (pay to watch, subscription base, ad base during breaks) instead of hosting/promoting live in person concerts. No reason to be doing live shows during this pandemic.

Age is not a barrier for competitive IMO, most people when they get older (mid-late 20s) just stop putting the time in to stay on top, when the young guns just play 18 hours a day. https://t.co/MA3Of0Dlox If you are a talented young gamer, and want to make it in the streaming/pro world, just put the #timein and you can get there.

You have to understand what\u2019s causing it, look at those reasons, and decide for yourself. @OpTicMaNiaC @hitchariide When peaceful protesting accomplishes nothing and people feel like change will never happen, riots occur. Of course you will have some people who are rioting for selfish reasons, but that\u2019s how it starts. @DpsHeals @OmarJimenez This isn\u2019t politics this is human rights. A black reporter @OmarJimenez  gets arrested with valid media credentials while cooperating with police (all filmed live) and George\u2019s murderer is still free tells you all you need to know about America\u2019s problems.

To every single CONSOLE player, your aim assist will not be touched. Also, I am not the reason they are nerfing this \ud83d\ude10 They completely removed bounties? I thought they were super well balanced. The team being hunted has ample time to post up in a building or roof and defend themselves until time runs out, also knowing how close the threat is. High risk High reward for players hunting. https://t.co/RHRpZiQp2B @MustacheMasonTV @FortniteGame It\u2019s over performing on 240hz monitors on pc bud.

Again, I was asking for opinions and takes on this because I FEEL like extra points and short kicks should be easy $$ but I\u2019m not a professional NOR do I claim be. @CashNastyGaming If my job was to kick the ball 25 yards and make an extra point and that was my only job and I couldn\u2019t do that consistently? That\u2019s what im referencing. Obviously weather conditions and 40+ yard kicks that shit is another level. @Stealth_Nation @CashNastyGaming Dude I am talking about 30 yard - kicks not 40+ with weather conditions and shit @CashNastyGaming I played soccer for 18 years but ok. @bansky @KMaine1328 @duckybtw His opinion was a dig trying to insult my question with a horrible analogy. @ILLUMANINETY Probably @SayNoToRage @Slasher @katienolan Duuuuuuude this is so stupid haha I am not saying I can make these kicks. Because i am not a kicker nor have I been practicing and kicking my entire non existent football career. @Camdonahuee @duckybtw No I didn\u2019t lol @Slasher Terrible @PacmanJT @JKap415 Im more focused on shorter kicks that 60 yard field goals haha @caseykreiter @TylerKluver I don\u2019t even wanna fathom the mental pressure/game kickers go through, and I don\u2019t wanna take that away from them. @esportslaw Dude I would be paying 10s of thousands of dollars to get my kicker therapy and make him practice mediation with monks in the off season.

They are turning into arena matches without siphon and like you said the flow of the games are awkward. It\u2019s probably incredible for the casuals. RT @TheDailyShow: Here\u2019s the full interview with @ninja: https://t.co/e6khnYspM3 @LachlanYT @TTfue I played it during SBMM... idk where your getting your info dude lol I personally do not like the que times and mega tryhards due to skill based matchmaking. I\u2019ve addressed my concerns in a constructive way and have been trying to use my influence behind the scenes to figure out the best solution, even if that\u2019s reverting. https://t.co/go3Y66mlOE @Asmongold @TTfue Again, I\u2019ll say it a thousand times! There are positive ways and constructive ways to address things you don\u2019t like about games. @LachlanYT @TTfue Been doing it for the last week. @FortniteBRLive I was 5 years younger and less experienced in competition and so much more. I\u2019m trying to use what I\u2019ve learned over 8 years of streaming and 10 years of professional gaming to stop shit I\u2019ve seen and done in the past. Learn from your mistakes! Also good on you creeping this hard @issa @parpyfn @TTfue When you bring up something irrelevant to the argument you take an L brother. Have a good one man ^_^ @issa @parpyfn @TTfue Two of those are jokes, and the other constructive criticism.  Not blatant negativity. Issa cmon man lol your stretching and it\u2019s embarrassing @infamous_FN @TTfue Someone forcing you to play? @parpyfn @TTfue Coming from the dude tweeting about how shit the game is yet plays it and uploads Fortnite videos everyday? What\u2019s more of an #ad? Shitty insult @TTfue I actually have been enjoying the game recently after the Gotham City update. If you don\u2019t enjoy the game, stop playing and roasting it all the time. Be sure to tune in to @TheDailyShow tonight at 11 EST on Comedy Central! https://t.co/eoeVIITMca That might be the best touchdown Catch of the season RT @TheDailyShow: TONIGHT: Professional gamer @Ninja is here to talk about his new book \u201cGet Good\u201d!\n\n\ud83d\udcf8: @seanogallagher https://t.co/ES2dNY\u2026 @dellorlol Happy to hear you got help and are getting better bud :) RT @VancityReynolds: @Ninja @ShawnLevyDirect \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude4c So excited to be part of this.
