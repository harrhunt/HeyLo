I understand y\u2019all are young but that\u2019s rarely ever true for most women. @killuralex @didietheboss Your \u201cside\u201d becomes a little hard to feel empathetic to with that being the situation... especially when I\u2019m pulling up messages about this man wanting to marry me etc and y\u2019all still talking about me as if I stalk the man. Y\u2019all brainwashed. Fr. @killuralex @didietheboss I hit your friend up when her name first came to light, and sent her my phone number to talk so she could be fully aware of the situtuon although I knew that she knew he was in a relationship.
