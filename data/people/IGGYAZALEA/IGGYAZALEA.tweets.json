Hint: \nshe loves a good ganache \ud83d\ude09 @arvinpanado I think from what I can see; it\u2019s more about the fact they didn\u2019t even give her the opportunity to at least bid on her own masters; when she\u2019s made it known she wanted to purchase. I can totally understand where she\u2019s coming from. Meet &amp; Greet passes are sold separately from the ticket itself so they\u2019re via another company website: \n\nYou can check out the VIP packages here! \nhttps://t.co/zj7YiTjssU https://t.co/ou0tqlGXvC LA!  \n\nTickets are close to sell out; come see me, my new album set list and @VanessaVanjie July 19th: \n\nhttps://t.co/1oEMqESJMJ https://t.co/dLCOmb5Tzi @IsItChillTaylo @nickwaka24 We know you don\u2019t, that\u2019s why they have such a low life expectancy &amp; need more ppl talking about how we can help create awareness &amp; safe spaces dumb dumb.
