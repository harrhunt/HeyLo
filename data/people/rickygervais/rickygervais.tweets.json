Many other caveats too for free speech :) @iainlee Did they type that with their feet? It's common now to mistake defending someone's right to say things, with agreeing with those things.

I think you're using the word \"reasonable\" to mean \"common\". @VonHamburger @McAllisterDen That's true of all the gods then. @McAllisterDen You can't disprove theism. It's a faith.
