Today, tomorrow, and every day after - #blacklivesmatter. It is sickening that a 17 year old can cross state lines with a weapon, shoot protestors, walk past Police, &amp; then go home to sleep in their own bed before being arrested. The contrast in how we are treating people of color has never been more apparent than it is right now. Sending my support for Jacob &amp; his family through what will likely be a long recovery as well as the victims of the shootings during Tuesday night\u2019s protests. Jacob Blake is a father, a brother, an uncle, and most important - a human. He was shot in the back 7 times right in front of his 4 kids and is currently paralyzed from the waist down.
