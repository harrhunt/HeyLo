Another historic moment for California: @AsmShirleyWeber, a tireless fighter for justice and civil rights, will be the first Black woman to serve as Secretary of State.\u00a0And she certainly won't be the last. Congratulations! https://t.co/DNbPlmFobl Congratulations to my dear friend, @AlexPadilla4CA! Alex and I have long served the people of California together, and I know he will continue fighting for our state as California\u2019s first Latino senator. The bipartisan COVID-19 relief bill is critical to helping fight this pandemic, including support for vaccine distribution and help for communities that have been hit the hardest.\n\nBut let's be clear\u2014our work isn't over. The American people desperately need more help. We are at a critical moment right now with COVID-19 spreading rapidly in California and across the country. Don\u2019t let up on wearing a mask. Some #MondayMotivation from the great Shirley Chisholm to help you get through the rest of today: \"If they don't give you a seat at the table, bring a folding chair.\u201d No one should live in fear because of who they are. We must keep fighting to protect trans women from this epidemic of violence\u2014in particular Black trans women. https://t.co/tJWFs95uzH I'm pleased that my bipartisan bill to help states identify the remains of missing persons along the border has passed Congress and is ready to become law. The families of those lost deserve nothing less. I know how hard it must be for so many Americans who won\u2019t be seeing loved ones over the holidays. Take some time to call someone you haven\u2019t seen in a while, check in on your single friends, or write that letter you\u2019ve been putting off. We will get through this. We must always continue speaking these words: All Black Lives Matter. Daily COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in California are at the highest they\u2019ve ever been. Please continue doing everything you can to reduce the spread of this deadly virus. Stay safe out there. https://t.co/LTqVXh5mKB These daily coronavirus numbers are harrowing. Please do everything you can to limit travel over the holidays. And remember to do the basics: wear a mask, wash your hands, and practice social distancing (but not emotional distancing). https://t.co/kUJjNBPqiB The American people have a right to expect that their leaders in Congress see them and act in their best interest. The relief that folks need right now is very real.\n\nCongress must act\u2014immediately. I wear a mask to protect myself, those around me, and my community\u2014and I do it for our health care workers across the country who are relying on all of us to do our part.\n\nWhy do you wear a mask? Millions of Americans are hanging on to their livelihoods by a thread. Congress must pass a new relief bill before this month is over.https://t.co/HTg3yNnUIO This is a ray of hope, but we have to keep doing the most basic things to keep our communities safe. ICU beds in California are at critical levels. Hospitals and health care workers need us to do our part\u2014that starts with wearing a mask. https://t.co/RoEk9MVC8S The American people desperately need\u00a0Congress to pass a new\u00a0relief\u00a0bill\u00a0before the year is over.

Health care workers have been on the frontlines of this crisis risking their lives fighting this pandemic. I\u2019m grateful for their commitment to keeping Americans safe\u2014thank you. Eight years ago, our country mourned the tragic loss of 20 children and 6 teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Today, we remember the lives lost and honor them by continuing our fight for common-sense gun laws. California hospitals and health care workers continue to face record numbers of coronavirus cases. Please wear a mask, wash your hands, and stay at home when possible. We will get through this pandemic together. https://t.co/lNOFfKOi6B This Sunday, I\u2019m thinking about the inspiring words of the great John Lewis, \"You are a light. You are the light.

There has been over 15.8 million coronavirus cases and over 294,000 deaths in the United States. It is devastating. I\u2019m keeping all those who have lost a loved one to this deadly pandemic close to my heart. I support today's defense bill that will support service members, their families and veterans, and keep Americans safe, while promoting diversity and inclusion in our military by\u00a0ensuring that all bases honoring Confederates are renamed. A very Happy Hanukkah to all those celebrating in California and across the country! May these eight nights of reflection be filled with light, love, and hope.

Californians, I cannot stress enough how critical it is right now to prevent the spread of this deadly virus. Hospitals and health care workers are overwhelmed and counting on all of us to do our part. https://t.co/EvKmE7ICdu I often look to the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for inspiration. And in this moment, these words ring especially true: \u201cOnly when it is dark enough, can you see the stars.\u201d\n\nNo matter how dark these days may seem, we will get through it.

The fate of our economy depends on getting ahold of this deadly virus. There\u2019s no question about that. Best of luck to the team aboard the Crew Dragon Resilience on this historic mission, including California native @AstroVicGlover! https://t.co/U7IUDgQfgY Thinking about health care workers who have given it their all during this pandemic, many of whom are once again facing record hospitalizations as coronavirus cases surge.

Wishing a very happy #Diwali to all those celebrating in California and around the world! May the victory of light over darkness inspire all of us. Millions of Americans remain unemployed with no way to pay rent or put food on the table. There\u2019s no question we must do more to help people across the country who are struggling to make ends meet. More than 1 million Californians have contracted COVID-19.

While folks are trying to make ends meet and barely hanging on to their homes, Republicans are prioritizing confirming a Supreme Court nominee who could strike down the Affordable Care Act in the middle of a pandemic. It\u2019s just unconscionable. Coronavirus cases are rising across the country, once again overwhelming hospitals and health care workers in certain areas. Wear a mask, wash your hands, and keep practicing social distancing. Mitch McConnell has the Senate working through the weekend right now\u2014not to provide COVID-19 relief to people who need it, but to jam through a Supreme Court confirmation.

Today, I joined @SenWarren in urging the administration to stop supporting a lawsuit to strike down the Affordable Care Act. It's unconscionable, especially during a pandemic. And it has to stop. Tearing down the Affordable Care Act has been one of Republicans\u2019 top priorities for more than a decade.\n\nThey've tried 70 times to repeal or roll back the ACA in Congress.\n\nNow, they're rushing through Trump's Supreme Court nominee to ensure it finally happens. Say it with me: the Senate should be passing the House\u2019s COVID-19 relief bill to help the American people, not rushing to confirm a Supreme Court justice so they can gut access to health care during a pandemic. Voting rights\nWorkers\u2019 rights\nConsumer rights\nReproductive rights\nAccess to health care\nThe fight against climate change\nOur country\u2019s timeless pursuit of \u2018Equal Justice Under Law\u2019\n\nEvery one of these things is at risk with this Supreme Court nominee. Climate change has primed California for longer, more devastating wildfire seasons. Federal firefighters deserve to have the peace of mind that they will be properly paid for protecting our communities. I\u2019m pushing the administration to ensure that. Because of COVID-19, more than 8 million Americans may have a new preexisting condition. If Republicans confirm Trump\u2019s SCOTUS nominee, we know what could happen: the Court guts the Affordable Care Act and ends protections for preexisting conditions. #WeDissent We cannot go back to when insurance companies could refuse to cover basic medical expenses like maternity care, mental health care, prescription drugs, and deny coverage for preexisting conditions like asthma and diabetes.

This week\u2019s Supreme Court hearings lacked legitimacy in the eyes of the American people. More than 23 million have already voted.

Today, Senate Republicans made it crystal clear that rushing a Supreme Court nomination is more important than helping the American people who are suffering from a deadly pandemic and a devastating economic crisis. Senate Republicans haven\u2019t lifted a finger in 150 days to consider the House\u2019s COVID-19 relief bill\u2014but they\u2019re determined to rush through a SCOTUS confirmation. https://t.co/lWOe5bO77D The hearings\u00a0this week\u00a0should have been postponed.

That's when the United States Supreme Court is set to hear a case to strike down the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSenate Republicans are fast tracking this nominee today in order to ensure that happens. To everyone who is barely hanging onto their homes, who has lost a loved one to COVID-19, who has no way to pay the bills: know that instead of voting to provide relief you desperately need, Senate Republicans today are choosing to hold a hearing to confirm a judge. For the millions who rely on the ACA for health care, everything is on the line with the Supreme Court confirmation hearings this week. Protections for preexisting conditions. Your ability to stay on your parent\u2019s health insurance until 26 years old. Stand up and speak out. Why are Senate Republicans fast tracking a Supreme Court confirmation? Because in November, the Supreme Court is hearing a case that could overturn the Affordable Care Act. They\u2019ve been trying to dismantle the ACA for years, and confirming this nominee will help ensure that. By moving forward with Supreme Court confirmation hearings tomorrow\u2014less than 2 weeks after members tested positive\u2014Chairman Graham and Senate Republicans are endangering the lives of not just members and our staff, but the hardworking people who keep the Senate complex running. The vast majority of Americans want the Senate to pass additional COVID-19 relief legislation instead of pushing through a Supreme Court confirmation.\n\nCountless Americans are hanging on to their homes by a thread\u2014they must be our priority. It comes down to this: months into a global pandemic that has killed more than 214,000 Americans, Senate Republicans are pushing through a SCOTUS confirmation instead of taking up legislation to help people get through the worst health crisis our country has seen in a century. Every member on the Senate Judiciary Committee must be tested for COVID-19 before the Supreme Court confirmation hearings start on Monday. Today I joined @SenatorLeahy and @SenBooker in demanding that all senators on the Judiciary committee get tested for COVID-19 ahead of the Supreme Court hearings.\n\nThis is the bare minimum to ensure the safety of members, our staff, and the Senate complex employees. If you:\nHave a preexisting condition\nLove someone with a preexisting condition\n\nKnow that protections for anyone with a preexisting condition are on the line if Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans confirm another Supreme Court Justice. Instead of taking up additional COVID-19 relief legislation that our country so desperately needs, the Senate on Monday is holding Supreme Court confirmation hearings. This is entirely out of touch with what the American people are demanding. History will judge this administration harshly for what they have done and continue to do to immigrant children. https://t.co/oqlwnUAXBT California continues to lead the way in the fight against climate change.

This is utterly reckless. If Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans confirm another Supreme Court justice, voting rights in America would be under attack for a generation. We must stand up and speak out. Some basic truths: COVID-19 is much deadlier than the flu. Wearing a mask saves lives. Don\u2019t let up on taking such a simple step to protect yourself and the people you love. It's completely unacceptable that critical materials were withheld from the Senate Judiciary Committee in relation to Trump\u2019s SCOTUS nominee.\n\nYesterday, I joined Judiciary Committee Democrats in pushing the Justice Department to provide any other missing materials\u2014immediately.

There\u2019s no question what SCOTUS must do: Dreamers have to be protected. To be Black in America is to wake up each day wondering if you\u2019ll live to see the next. And that's an enormous weight on anyone's mental health.\n\nRemember: it\u2019s ok to seek help. If you live in California, our statewide mental health line 1-855-845-7415. https://t.co/CVZ4K8SJpp SCOTUS sent a clear message to the country today: LGBTQ+ workers must be treated with dignity, respect, and Equal Justice Under Law. A historic Pride month for America. https://t.co/4eLWqsmIQB Joining the National Urban League in a moment to talk about the work we\u2019re doing in Congress to address the crises facing our nation today, including police violence and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTune in here. https://t.co/MW6YEYLhtf Just incredible. Tens of thousands of people yesterday in West Hollywood for the All Black Lives Matter march. This isn\u2019t just a moment\u2014it\u2019s a movement.\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 by Gabe Taino. https://t.co/cPQqLQe4ns I'm proud that my whistleblower protections are included in @SenWarren's broad package of reforms. The American people must have faith that taxpayer dollars aren't misused, and that means protecting those who come forward to report misuse of funds. I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: the fight for environmental justice is a fight for racial justice. https://t.co/8cFr3jnp08 Far too many Black and brown communities don't have access to public parks. As we consider the Great American Outdoors Act in the Senate, we have the opportunity to not only support public lands but also address this injustice.\n\nLet's get it done. https://t.co/sDf8yB9D4h We\u2019re not going to let up in our fight for justice for Breonna Taylor. Keep speaking out and demanding the arrest of the police involved in her murder. This movement is just beginning. I\u2019m outraged that Republicans are pushing an anti-civil rights nominee for a lifetime judicial seat\u2014especially as our country is reckoning with systemic racism in our institutions.\n\nWe have to stop Cory Wilson. https://t.co/nf8vTCXtVy .@RepKatiePorter and I refuse to let the Trump administration get away with hiding information on companies that received taxpayer funded COVID-19 relief.\n\nWe\u2019re demanding nothing short of full transparency. https://t.co/rwdMMy1V2f There are more confederate statues in the United States Capitol than there are statues of Black women. This is completely backwards. It\u2019s time for them to go. Black blood stains America\u2019s sidewalks. And we\u2019ve had enough. This week, we announced the Justice in Policing Act to reform our nation\u2019s police departments. https://t.co/0lZ3dz3EAC America has seen great progress, but just last week we could not get an anti-lynching bill passed in the United States Senate. We have so much work to do.\n \nOur Justice in Policing Act is a chance to enact historic reforms in policing. Congress must pass it immediately. Powerful words from Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s mother, Wanda. Her message is clear\u2014Georgia must pass a hate crime bill and make clear the consequences for murdering someone because of the color of their skin. #JusticeForAhmaud https://t.co/pCh6q9QlW0 Four years after #Pulse, we remember the 49 lives lost. Let\u2019s say their names, read and share their stories, and honor their memories by taking action. https://t.co/rptvDjQxqU The callousness of Trump to announce this during LGBTQ+ Pride month as the country mourns the four year anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shooting. The cruelty is the point and it knows no bounds.\n\nWe will fight this. https://t.co/oi8XpPAbXb The moment I introduced an amendment to hold Bill Barr accountable for reportedly ordering the removal of peaceful protesters. With tear gas.\n\nRepublicans rejected my amendment. https://t.co/y0CSOVwn8i .@RepKatiePorter has been a tireless fighter for the people of California for as long as I\u2019ve known her. I\u2019m proud to work alongside her in Congress to ensure COVID-19 relief funds get to people who need it the most. https://t.co/2peE9xPbKj A small but important step towards justice for Breonna Taylor. Now arrest the police who were involved in her murder. https://t.co/95Edy2RUWs Earlier today, Republicans voted to grant unprecedented power to Chairman Graham so he can transform the Senate Judiciary Committee into Trump\u2019s political attack dogs. What we saw this week in Georgia was blatant voter suppression, and we will not stand for it. My VoteSafe Act would expand vote-by-mail and ensure in-person voting is safe\u2015including with maximum wait times.\n\nNo one should wait in line for hours to vote. Republicans just rejected my amendment to investigate Bill Barr for reportedly ordering peaceful protesters to be forcibly cleared out near the White House.\n\nIf the Attorney General ordered protesters to be tear gassed, we need to know about it. This is outrageous. With the Justice in Policing Act, we have an opportunity to pass transformative, lasting reforms to fix our police departments.\n \nThe American people are watching. The time to act is now. https://t.co/AWUbWinxzw Republicans rejected a resolution by @SenSchumer to immediately consider our Justice in Policing Act when it passes the House. It's shameful.\n\nThe American people are marching and shouting in the streets for change. We need to act. https://t.co/D6pXdqUz9R We have more than a flawed system\u2014we have a crisis. Black blood stains America\u2019s sidewalks. @SenBooker and I announced the Justice in Policing Act to enact historic reforms to change that. https://t.co/0lZ3dz3EAC Rather than pass our Justice in Policing Act, Senate Judiciary Republicans want to advance anti-civil rights nominee Cory Wilson for a lifetime judicial appointment tomorrow.\n\nThis is so out of step with what the American people are demanding right now. I'm voting NO. #StopWilson We announced the Justice in Policing Act because Black Americans want to stop being killed. It\u2019s just that simple. The Senate must pass our bill immediately. Philonise Floyd's testimony is a call on every member of Congress to do the hard work of enacting lasting change. For George, for Breonna, for Atatiana, for every Black American murdered by police violence.\n\nWe must listen. https://t.co/ktBVglkrV3 It\u2019s really simple: hurricanes and wildfires are different by nature, and FEMA cannot have a one-size-fits-all plan for addressing these natural disasters. Especially during a pandemic. https://t.co/ENLXnqcNih Our economy is now in a recession, stemming from a public health crisis with no end in sight. We need bold policies if we\u2019re going to get through this crisis.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m proposing $2,000 monthly payments for the duration of the pandemic. America has confused having safe communities with having more cops on the street. It's time to change that. https://t.co/YBzTKmDXXB 1.7 million students have police in their school but no counselor.\n3 million have police but no nurse.\n6 million have police but no psychologist.\n10 million have police but no social worker.\n\nWe need systemic change\u2014now. It\u2019s past time for all three police officers who murdered Breonna Taylor to be arrested. It\u2019s been almost three months. There\u2019s no reason for them to still be roaming free. I know that we can have a country without police violence. But leaders must have the will to enact change. Some of what my Justice in Policing Act will do:\n\n-Ban chokeholds and no-knock warrants in drug cases\n-Establish a national use of force standard\n-End qualified immunity for police\n-Expand pattern and practice investigations\n-Establish a National Police Misconduct Registry https://t.co/aTWUgVowZP Black and brown communities are overcriminalized and overpoliced. We must address police brutality with bold action and swift accountability.\n\nToday, I announced the Justice in Policing Act to hold police accountable for misconduct. https://t.co/dDwz8LtHd3 We\u2019re here because Black Americans want to stop being killed. That\u2019s why my colleagues and I have announced the Justice in Policing Act. https://t.co/UHkEOKurAY We just announced the first ever comprehensive police accountability and reform bill to:\n\n- Create a national standard for use of force \n- Expand pattern and practice investigations into police departments\n- Increase independent investigations into police misconduct The murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and countless others must be met with decisive action. Watch here as I join @SenBooker, @TheBlackCaucus, and Congressional leaders to announce our reforms to hold police accountable. https://t.co/QVpcVt04Q4 Heartbroken for Robert Forbes\u2019 family and loved ones. We need to know whether this tragedy was intentional. https://t.co/2Y4PWnayex Unemployment corrected to 16.3%.\nBlack unemployment 16.8%, the highest in more than 10 years.\nLatino unemployment 17.6%.\n\nAny leader taking a victory lap over these numbers is completely out of touch with working people. We have so much more work to do. https://t.co/WeS6gKXgP1 Unbelievable courage and strength from Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor\u2019s mothers during these times. https://t.co/NIASMqVwaG Black women killed at the hands of law enforcement cannot be forgotten in our fight for justice. #Saytheirnames https://t.co/sSHkqfx3cs Total incompetence. https://t.co/oOfp0dbMgL It's been 402 days since Attorney General Bill Barr last testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He has a lot to answer for.\n\nBarr needs to explain under oath whether he ordered peaceful protesters to be forcibly cleared out near the White House this week. @mollyhf @MnDPS_MSP @MnDPS_DPS You have such strength, Molly. This should never have happened, but I cannot thank you enough for having the courage to continue your critical work. 1 Republican senator stood in the way of passing my bill to make lynching a federal crime. There was no reason for this other than cruel and deliberate obstruction, during the very hour of George Floyd\u2019s memorial.\n\nWatch my full speech. https://t.co/mgl3B2yPC3 Thank you, @RepLucyMcBath.  Americans are fed up with our country\u2019s inaction on gun violence. Leaders need to have the courage to act. #GunViolenceAwarenessDay https://t.co/e6KWVzxk3h We need a national standard on the use of force by police.\nWe need independent investigations into police misconduct and officer-involved killings.\nWe need real police accountability. https://t.co/TvakiJRrKl Lynching isn\u2019t just a part of our past. Ahmaud Arbery was murdered just 3 months ago. And Senator @RandPaul is blocking our bill to make lynching a federal crime. https://t.co/p5Lk8PJUph Breonna Taylor should be alive today, celebrating her 27th birthday with family and friends. Instead, she was shot in her own home on March 13 by police officers who still haven\u2019t been arrested. We need #JusticeforBreonna. Disgraceful that Trump is celebrating 13.3% unemployment during the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and a pandemic with no end in sight.\n\nMy bill would provide $2,000 monthly payments to get people through this pandemic\u2014and for 3 months after. \u201cThe only wrong thing to say is to say nothing.\" Thank you, Meghan, for this powerful statement. https://t.co/tDf26TSgNz History will remember that on this day\u2014the day of George Floyd's funeral\u2014Senator @RandPaul rejected our anti-lynching legislation and attempted to water it down. It's absolutely disgraceful. https://t.co/GDbKsJngDU @kyialuvu @ScottBrinton1 Wynta-Amor gives me hope. Thank you both for everything that you\u2019re doing. We\u2019re in this fight together. 8 minutes and 46 seconds of silence this morning. In those last moments of his life, George Floyd called for his late mother and said he could not breathe.\n\nThis is why we fight. https://t.co/yy6lrNBQz0 No longer can people wait on the sidelines, hoping for incremental change to address the systemic racism that has plagued our country since its earliest days.\n\nIn times like this, silence is complicity. Read my op-ed. https://t.co/kXn8KrdWbe I invite Bill Barr to say this in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2014under oath. https://t.co/TpTG659XxV We urgently need an investigation and a Judiciary Committee hearing on Bill Barr reportedly ordering peaceful protesters to be forcibly cleared out near the White House earlier this week.\n\nI\u2019m introducing an amendment to make that happen. https://t.co/qdCrgiwOWN This morning, the Senate Judiciary Committee isn\u2019t voting on legislation to confront the life or death crises before us. Instead, it\u2019s nursing Trump\u2019s wounded ego with a partisan subpoena. Shameful. Racism against Black folks, Latinos, Asians, and our Native brothers and sisters is bad for everyone. https://t.co/BK1jQ176sH \"We die playing outside. We die babysitting. We die eating ice cream.

Yes, Gianna, he changed the world. https://t.co/0BYAWbcSnr I share in your sadness, anger, and pain. Our country can no longer accept the status quo where Black people are treated as less than human. We need an America that lives up to the ideals of Equal Justice Under Law.\n\nRead my op-ed. https://t.co/pWBomPIwt1 Tragic. My heart goes out to Dave Underwood's family and loved ones. While we await a federal investigation, it's critical that this senseless violence isn't used to diminish the real pain felt in Oakland by protesters marching for justice. https://t.co/qR9YzyaIrH Strong oversight of government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic requires an independent watchdog. Trump will do anything to escape accountability\u2014so he tapped his lawyer Brian Miller to be Inspector General &amp; sweep wrongdoing under the rug.\n\nI voted NO today on his nomination. We need leaders who acknowledge that in the history of America, Black people have always been treated as less than human. Yet rather than address the systemic racism in our institutions, Trump is fanning the flames of racism and discrimination. There is not a single Black man I know who hasn\u2019t been the subject of some form of racial discrimination at the hands of law enforcement. Not one. That\u2019s why people are marching in the streets. https://t.co/qYrlAblyf7 Bill Barr\u2019s DOJ long ago abandoned pursuing meaningful reform in our police departments. But @vanitaguptaCR is right\u2014even while this administration refuses to stand up against police brutality, every leader in America must push for accountability. https://t.co/U58SLkUMuF George Floyd\nAhmaud Arbery\nBreonna Taylor\nMichael Brown\nTrayvon Martin\nEric Garner\nPhilando Castile\nSandra Bland\nLaquan McDonald\nTamir Rice\nJordan Davis\nAlton Sterling\nFreddie Gray\nSean Reed\nCountless others\n\nWe need to speak their names. We need to honor them. We need to act. https://t.co/5vhu1sGoxM More than 50 years ago, Pride was born out of protest and Black trans women standing up to police brutality, leading to the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement.\n\nDecades after that fateful day in New York City, the fight continues. Happy #Pride2020. Donald Trump has combined the worst of George Wallace with Richard Nixon. When he talks about \u201cdominate\u201d the streets, he means supremacy. 100,000+ American deaths from COVID-19.\nCountless fed up with ongoing police brutality.\n40 million unemployed.\nNo national testing strategy for the pandemic.\n\nThe lack of leadership on every one of these issues falls squarely on the occupant in the White House. Now is the time for every ally to have those uncomfortable conversations about racism with family, friends, and neighbors. Call it out in every instance\u2014even when it\u2019s difficult. Why is it that Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort were granted release to home confinement while thousands of low-risk, vulnerable inmates remain in prison, where COVID-19 is spreading dangerously?\n\n@RepJeffries and I are demanding answers. https://t.co/fGrai52kqo If you don\u2019t agree that we have systemic racism in law enforcement, then you\u2019re not qualified to serve the people. https://t.co/lqeKXpJpxw A free and independent press is a bedrock of our democracy. It's part of what sets us apart from dictatorships. Attacking press who are on the ground during these protests is horrifying and undermines our democracy.\n\nThis must stop immediately. https://t.co/I6758AlQW6 The deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor are not isolated incidents. They are the result of systematic racism that has existed for generations.\n\nPolice brutality is a matter of life &amp; death for Black people in America. Countless others should still be alive. Every American has a right to demand that law enforcement is accountable to the communities they are sworn to protect and serve. Period. People in Los Angeles, Oakland, and across California are hurting. The murder of George Floyd is a painful reminder of centuries of oppression, and the Black community is demanding justice.\n\nTo those marching in California: make your voices heard and be safe. Absolutely horrifying. Now more than ever, we need the cameras on and we need honest reporting of what\u2019s happening. This officer must face swift accountability. https://t.co/mPC424oQRN Every single officer involved must be held accountable for George Floyd\u2019s murder. Every person across the country must speak out and condemn the call for violence against American citizens by the President of the United States earlier today. We have to stand together against this dangerous attempt to divide us. Thinking about Black journalists who may have a difficult time covering the events in Minneapolis and the protests across the country. Your work is always important, but especially right now.

I\u2019m Black and beautiful.\u201d \u2013 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. https://t.co/0ycfSt2NgY Our country has a long history of slavery, Jim Crow, lynchings, segregation, and discrimination. The injustices of the past live on in our institutions today. We need systemic change.\n\nBlack Americans are fed up. The officer who killed George Floyd must be arrested for murder. We need answers on what this administration is doing to protect the health and safety of young people in juvenile facilities during the pandemic. These children must be protected. https://t.co/UuLJnLXq3o We have to remember the countless Black Americans who never had a chance at justice because no one recorded a video of their death. We need immediate, structural change to address these injustices. Vulnerable individuals, including pregnant women, should be prioritized for release from prison during the pandemic\u2014not Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort.\n\nThis is what corruption looks like in Bill Barr's Justice Department. https://t.co/KLKq1N8EOF Yesterday's protests in Los Angeles and Minneapolis make it clear that people are rightfully hurting over George Floyd's death. We need swift accountability.\n\nThe officer who killed George Floyd must be arrested for murder and every officer involved must be held accountable. Wearing a mask has nothing to do with politics. It's about your personal safety and the safety of those around you.\n\nWear a mask. https://t.co/8xjmCilZyN What happened to Christian Cooper can lead to what happened to George Floyd. And this has been happening for generations\u2014cell phones only made it more visible.\n\nWe\u2019ve had enough. We need immediate, systemic changes to address these injustices. 100,000 American deaths. My heart aches for the pain this virus has caused so many people across the country.\n\nAmericans desperately want this administration to embrace science and have the moral leadership to unify our country during this difficult time. Lives are on the line. Esmeralda is one of thousands of health care workers who are wondering whether our government will deport them. It shouldn\u2019t be this way.\n\nNo health care worker should fear losing their immigration status during this crisis. https://t.co/qtjCSYPHD9 \u201cPlease. I can't breathe.\u201d These were some of George Floyd\u2019s last words before he died.\n\nWe need an investigation into the practices of the Minneapolis Police Department. And the officers involved must be held accountable\u2014not just fired from their jobs. #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd Black small business owners have dropped 40%.\nLatino small business owners, 32%.\nAsian small business owners, 25%.\n\nThese numbers are devastating.

Congress must pass my Outdoors for All Act. https://t.co/594cuDCIy8 While we fight to expand vote-by-mail, we have to remember that many don\u2019t have that option.

Our communities won't look the same if we don't get money to the mom and pop stores that need it most.\n\nMy Saving Our Street Act would do exactly that. https://t.co/uoxwmubJXL Every year on Memorial Day, we honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation. We owe a profound debt to each and every one of them.\n\nIt\u2019s on all of us to remember their names, and never forget their sacrifice. We need an independent investigation into the killing of Breonna Taylor. Her life was senselessly taken by police, and her family deserves swift accountability.  https://t.co/qAPA0zH9ZH The U.S. will soon reach 100,000 deaths from COVID-19. That\u2019s more than 40x the number of lives lost in the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nWe must remember that each death is one death too many. Every person lost is someone\u2019s loved one, a neighbor, a friend. To all those celebrating Eid al-Fitr in California and around the world: I wish you a joyous day to celebrate your month of fasting. Though Eid will look different this year, I hope your day is still filled with family, friends and blessings. #EidMubarak Trump and members of Congress have put the AAPI community at risk by racializing COVID-19 as the \u201cChinese virus\u201d and \u201cWuhan virus.\u201d It\u2019s on all of us to speak up, report, and condemn any racist attacks.\n\nRead my op-ed with @RobBontaCA. #APAHM https://t.co/yAklQFApPI RT @RobBontaCA: Thank you @SenKamalaHarris for raising your voice with me to reject Anti-AAPI intolerance, intimidation, and hate.

My VoteSafe Act would authorize $5 billion to:\n\n-Expand vote-by-mail\n-Require 20 days of early voting\n-Ensure in-person voting is still safe and accessible Not only is COVID-19 disproportionately impacting Native communities, but many health centers in these areas are at risk of closing down. That can\u2019t happen, especially during a pandemic.\n\nI'm pushing for funding to save Native and Tribal health facilities. https://t.co/ELkarlnWAk Being Trump\u2019s former fixer shouldn\u2019t get you special treatment in prison.\n\nWhile Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen get released to home confinement, thousands of low-risk, vulnerable people remain in overcrowded prisons where COVID-19 continues to spread. https://t.co/z3MA0Z90Au This was 100 days ago.

We need accountability for the loss of her life. Leaders need to lead, and that means we need ideas that rise to the level of this moment. I'm proud to cosponsor @SenBrianSchatz\u2019s new bill to employ 1.5 million workers across the country to help states stop the spread of COVID-19 and reopen safety. Climate change isn't waiting for this pandemic to end. We saw this after Hurricane Harvey and now, we're seeing devastating flooding threatening toxic sites in Michigan.\n\nIt's precisely why I introduced the Preparing Superfund for Climate Change Act. https://t.co/QcfmhloTy0 Millions of Americans are hurting because of this pandemic, but Homeland Security Committee Republicans chose to focus on partisan politics instead. Shameful. https://t.co/ZUbshQMPQG Astonishing. 38.6 million people have filed for unemployment in the past two months, and yet Senate Republicans say there\u2019s no urgency for additional COVID-19 relief.\n\nInstead, Mitch McConnell\u2019s priority this week is confirming more judges. https://t.co/K8MgK6OWXn Communities of color have far less access to trees &amp; green spaces, leading to more air pollution.\n\nAnd this isn't a separate issue from the pandemic\u2014air pollution is linked to higher COVID-19 deaths.\n\nI introduced the Outdoors for All Act to help fix this. https://t.co/hFnazuL7JV RT @SenateDems: \u201cOur committee must provide oversight because the American people and our constituents deserve to know what is going on.\u201d \u2014\u2026 .@SenRonJohnson unilaterally decided to force a vote today on a purely political matter that has absolutely nothing to do with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

It\u2019s beyond ridiculous. Hurricane season begins in two weeks and we already have a tropical storm heading towards North Carolina. I've been saying it for months: FEMA must be prepared for natural disasters during this pandemic. Lives are at stake. Unacceptable that @SenRonJohnson has not held a single Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing with Trump administration officials in two months.\n\nThe American people need to hear from officials handling the response to the pandemic\u2014immediately. The Supreme Court didn\u2019t issue a ruling on #DACA today. Hundreds of thousands of DREAMers continue to live in fear of how the Court will decide their future.\n\nI cannot say this enough to our DREAMers: I\u2019m with you, I see you, and no matter what, I will fight for you. I\u2019m calling for a Judiciary Committee hearing on the spread of COVID-19 in prisons because we need to hold leaders accountable for failing to prepare for the virus. I raised the alarm months ago that they needed to prepare. There\u2019s no excuse. We\u2019ve seen story after story of large companies receiving millions in federal relief while mom and pop businesses are shut out. It's outrageous.\n\n@RepPressley and I introduced the Saving Our Street Act to get money to micro businesses that truly need it. RT @SenSanders: $1,200 doesn't cut it. Congress must send a monthly $2,000 check to every person who needs it until this crisis is over. ht\u2026 It\u2019s heartbreaking that for some, staying at home has led to a higher risk of abuse.\n\nIf you need help, please call 1-800-656-4673 to reach the National Sexual Assault Hotline or visit https://t.co/eo0Wsii3KO. https://t.co/UAV8rvPXM3 Horrifying. Keeping the injured firefighters in my thoughts, and grateful for the first responders and firefighters who are on the scene.  We cannot thank them enough for their bravery in these moments. https://t.co/KeF74LGkEc Even as we approach 90,000 American deaths from COVID-19, Trump is still doing everything he can to punish career public servants in charge of holding his lawless administration accountable.\n\nCongress must investigate this. https://t.co/l6BPsRmyr3 Breonna Taylor should still be alive. Her family deserves swift accountability. The Department of Justice must immediately open a federal investigation into her killing. #SayHerName Forcing immigrant parents to choose between subjecting their children to indefinite detention or being separated from them is pure cruelty, especially during a pandemic. \n\n@DHSgov must end any practice that promotes family separations\u2014immediately. https://t.co/Tc0brCy1wF Dr. Rick Bright\u2019s testimony yesterday made it clear: the Trump administration squandered precious time to prepare for this pandemic. And we still don\u2019t have a \u201cmaster, coordinated plan\u201d for how to move forward. https://t.co/w7EAi2ZjIM Millions of people are struggling to pay rent and put food on the table. They shouldn't have to worry about paying for medical treatment if they get sick.\n\nI'm proud to introduce a bill today with @SenSanders to eliminate all out-of-pocket health costs during the pandemic. The racist attacks against Asians, Asian-Americans, and the broader AAPI community during the COVID-19 pandemic are sickening. There is no place for hate and discrimination in America.\n\nProud to lead a resolution with @SenDuckworth and @maziehirono  to condemn these attacks. This is what privilege looks like. For months, I've been pushing DOJ to release certain low-risk and vulnerable people to prevent the spread of COVID-19\u2014including the elderly and pregnant women.\n\nInstead, Trump's friend gets released to home confinement. https://t.co/8Dm59uVJPQ RT @SenJackyRosen: In order to get unemployment support to people faster we must upgrade IT systems for our state unemployment agencies in\u2026 In November, no one should have to risk their health in order to cast their vote. My VoteSafe Act with @WhipClyburn and @RepMarciaFudge will authorize $5 billion to ensure our elections are safe and accessible for all.\n\nThis cannot wait\u2014Congress must pass our bill. Trump will cast doubt on the death toll because it highlights his failed leadership that has cost lives. It's despicable that even in a pandemic, Trump cares more about his image than the people he serves.\n\nWe're not going to let him get away with it. https://t.co/Zgj4d9ok4I If DHS doesn't release more low-risk and vulnerable detained persons, including at Otay Mesa Detention Center, more people could die. It's that basic.\n\nI've been pushing this for months: DHS must take every step available to prevent more illness and death. https://t.co/VXe2TmazCu It\u2019s unconscionable that Trump and Republicans continue to support a lawsuit to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Yet that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re doing. In the middle of a pandemic. 36.5 million people have filed for unemployment in the last two months. 36.5 million. Americans are hurting and need help.\n\nI'm proposing $2,000 monthly payments to help get people through this crisis. We need a Judiciary Committee hearing on the spread of COVID-19 in our prisons.\n\nI raised the alarm in March that the Justice Department and Bureau of Prisons needed to prepare for COVID-19. They did not do that. And it's on us to hold Bill Barr\u2019s DOJ accountable. Pay attention to this. We cannot overlook the disproportionate impact coronavirus is having on Native communities. That's why I'm leading my colleagues in a push to save Tribal and Urban Indian Health Facilities. https://t.co/OZjzxEAdk2 This pandemic won't be over by November and we must take steps so Americans can safely exercise their right to vote. My VoteSafe Act would authorize $5 billion to:\n\n-Expand vote-by-mail\n-Require universal early voting\n-Ensure in-person voting is still safe and accessible This is absurd. In March, Betsy DeVos committed to ending wage garnishments over student loan debt, yet continues to cash in on people's wages.\n\nUnacceptable\u2014this needs to stop and she must be held accountable. https://t.co/di23oniNML We need to speak truth about who's bearing the brunt of the risk during this pandemic. It's everyday workers doing essential jobs\u2014and they are not sacrificial. https://t.co/2jQppv8IQ5 Even during the biggest public health and economic crisis in 100 years, Trump cares more about erasing his failures than addressing the pain being felt across the nation. It's unconscionable.\n\nI'll say it again: FEMA and HHS must ensure an accurate death toll. https://t.co/9wggu7Izvr We need an accurate death count to understand the severity of this crisis, full stop. Dr. Fauci\u2019s testimony made it clear that the death count is likely higher than what we know.\n\nI'm pushing FEMA and HHS to ensure that we have an accurate death toll. https://t.co/EKFIEhYIzW This is why I\u2019ve been calling for the safe release of immigrant children in U.S. custody. You cannot practice physical distancing in a shelter with dozens of children and staff.\n\nHHS must do more to protect the health and safety of these children\u2014now. https://t.co/jSrHoVvCDj The VoteSafe Act will expand vote-by-mail and early voting while ensuring in-person voting is still a safe option for those who want or need it.\n\nNovember is right around the corner\u2014we must pass our bill. https://t.co/HUAAiwWyDH It\u2019s long past time for Bill Barr to resign. https://t.co/G9FKKuqo8N We have to do more to ensure communities of color get the support and protections they need. My Democratic colleagues and I are fighting for that. https://t.co/y4WvOXFHth The VoteSafe Act is about making sure that the American people can exercise their right to vote during this pandemic without risking their health. There are elections already underway in Wisconsin and California today.\n\nThis cannot wait. https://t.co/hRhca5kq4h Today, I'm proud to partner with @WhipClyburn and @RepMarciaFudge on my VoteSafe Act. We're experiencing a public health crisis in the middle of an election year, and we must ensure that voting is safe and accessible for all. Taxpayers shouldn\u2019t foot the bill to save large corporations worth millions. We need to save the bodega, the nail salon, the food truck, and the florist down the street. \n\nMy Saving Our Street Act with @RepPressley would get money to micro businesses that truly need it. Voting in person holds great significance for Black voters\u2014for whom the right to vote was hard won. My VoteSafe Act would ensure in-person voting is safe for those who want or need it. https://t.co/jWFuG7HVgM I'm calling for an independent federal investigation into Ahmaud Arbery's killing. The video was a sickening display of the killing of an unarmed Black man in broad daylight. His family deserves justice. #JusticeForAhmaud Magnolia is a ray of sunshine\u2014just look at that smile! My congratulations to her and her family. https://t.co/ahEvYSwD79 I\u2019m proposing $2,000 monthly payments throughout the pandemic and for 3 months after, because rent and bills are still due during this crisis and people are going hungry. It\u2019s that basic. Cities should be able to deliver meals from local restaurants to vulnerable people. It\u2019s a common sense solution to feed hungry people and lift up restaurants and suppliers on the brink of collapse.\n\nI Introduced the FEED Act last week to make it easier for cities to do that. 5 transgender women of color have been murdered in the past month, including Nina Pop. There is an epidemic of violence against trans women of color and we need to act swiftly.\n\nI'm pushing for more funding to address hate crimes during this pandemic. https://t.co/mFcVc7RBvJ My new bill would provide $2,000 every single month for the duration of the pandemic, plus 3 months afterward. We need to confront the reality that a one-time payment just isn\u2019t enough to keep people fed. Congress must pass my bill. An important read by my friend @RepUnderwood. Countless Black mothers should be celebrating Mother\u2019s Day with their families today but they\u2019re dead, in part, because of racial bias in our health care system.\n\nThinking about them today and every day. https://t.co/yZOE80nMy7 My Saving Our Street Act is about getting help to those businesses that need it most. It provides grants to help small, neighborhood business down your street\u2014not Wall Street. https://t.co/lQkJXIUZBm RT @RepPressley: Our Microbusinesses are the backbones of our communities - our barbershops, beauty salons, and bodegas - and they need hel\u2026 Attorney General Bill Barr has corrupted our justice system by acting more like Trump's personal attorney than the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer.

Americans need more than just one payme\u2026 People need help throughout this crisis. It's just that simple. My new bill will provide $2,000 a month for the duration of the pandemic\u2014and for 3 months after\u2014to ensure folks can get back on their feet. RT @SenSanders: Millions of Americans don't know how they're going to pay for groceries, rent, utilities, or medicine.\n\nOur legislation wit\u2026 Now, at least 6 inmates have died from COVID-19 and 60% have tested positive. I raised the alarm MONTHS ago on the danger of COVID-19 in these facilities. It's unacceptable.\n\nSo today, I spoke with the warden at Terminal Island to push for releases\u2014because people are dying. In each instance, I laid out one critical thing they should do right away: look into releasing low-risk, vulnerable inmates including the elderly, immune-compromised, and pregnant women.\n\nThis also did not happen. THREAD\u2014let's talk about what's happening at Terminal Island prison.\n\nOn March 5, I was the first senator to demand the Bureau of Prisons prepare for COVID-19. Then, on April 2, I called on Terminal Island prison to lay out their plan to prepare for COVID-19.\n\nNeither happened. California has been torn apart by wildfires in recent years, and climate change is making things worse. It's unacceptable that FEMA is dragging its feet planning for natural disasters during this pandemic.\n\nFEMA needs to get its act together. Lives are at stake. https://t.co/jRvtmnDC5e My new bill with @SenSanders and @SenMarkey will provide monthly $2,000 payments to help people get through this crisis.\n\nBills come in every single month during the pandemic and so should help from our government. https://t.co/9aVuULCUue Today, I'm introducing the Monthly Economic Crisis Support Act to provide $2,000 every month throughout this crisis.\n\nI've been saying it for months: a one-time payment is not enough when millions of people are unemployed and need to eat. We need bold action, immediately. Trump is questioning the accuracy of the COVID-19 death toll because it ultimately highlights his failure of leadership during this pandemic. The American people deserve better than this.\n\nI'm pushing FEMA and HHS to ensure an accurate death toll. https://t.co/IlD0YSuCmf Health care should be a right, not a privilege. But let\u2019s be clear: if Trump and Republicans had their way, the Affordable Care Act would be overturned and millions more would be without health care. This is immoral. https://t.co/n0ZzPR8uKs Frontline workers are risking their lives every day to keep Americans safe during this pandemic\u2014they deserve to be protected and paid fairly. Congress must #ProtectEssentialWorkers and include the Essential Workers Bill of Rights in our next relief package. I\u2019m tired of seeing large corporations bailed out with taxpayer dollars while our smallest businesses just down the street are on the brink of collapse.\n\nYesterday, I introduced the Saving Our Street Act to create a $125 billion fund to help micro businesses\u2014not Wall Street. This is so important. Californians can now visit https://t.co/GVGzE6zMzd to find their nearest testing site and make an appointment. Once again, our state is showing leadership during this public health crisis. https://t.co/drge79zAwl Carlos's death was likely preventable. My heart goes out to his family.\n\nFor months, I have called on DHS and BOP to act quickly to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at facilities like Otay Mesa Detention Center. They must take every step available to prevent more illness and loss. https://t.co/iGtfFWQaAV Let's speak truth about this. When a Black woman has a son, she knows that he may never be safe because of the color of his skin. No parent should have to fear this.\n\nAhmaud Arbery's family deserves swift justice. #JusticeForAhmaud .@RepPressley is a dear friend of mine and I could not be more excited to work with her on our new bill, the Saving Our Street Act. https://t.co/OdpNaKKiS4 I said at the Homeland Security Committee in February that we must hear from top Trump administration officials in charge of addressing this pandemic.\n\nIt's been 2 months since our last oversight hearing while the death toll is mounting. Unacceptable. https://t.co/x8N3IT8nYO The American people are tired of taxpayer funds going to big corporations while neighborhood businesses continue to struggle. My new bill is about saving the micro businesses just down the street\u2014not Wall Street. https://t.co/e3gsZ5aHZ0 Think about the micro businesses down the street\u2014they\u2019re the heart and soul of our communities and they need help. @RepPressley and I introduced the Saving our Street Act today to get money to our smallest businesses that truly need it. https://t.co/lQkJXIUZBm Neighborhood businesses are being shut out from relief while large companies receive millions. I'm talking about bodegas, nail salons, florists and more.\n\nSo today, @RepPressley and I introduced the Saving Our Street Act to provide grants for micro-businesses that truly need it. I'm leading my colleagues in a push to save Native and Tribal health facilities. We're in the middle of a pandemic and we can\u2019t let these facilities close down while these communities are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. https://t.co/FiChvc4Bpk Yesterday I led more than 50 of my colleagues in a push for more funds for Tribal and Urban Indian Health Facilities.\n\nOur Tribal and Native communities are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 and these health facilities are in danger of closing. We can't let that happen. In some areas, Native women are murdered at a rate 10x the national average. Countless Native women &amp; girls remain missing.\n\nOn National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls, we must speak out for those impacted and commit to ending this crisis. #MMIWG We\u2019re proposing a common sense solution to lift up our struggling restaurant industry and address the crisis of hunger created by this pandemic. Proud to work alongside @RepMcGovern, @RepThompson, @SenatorTimScott, and @chefjoseandres on the FEED Act. https://t.co/95DOm6xf7z Earlier today I spoke with @ProtectOurCare about why the Affordable Care Act is so important during this pandemic.\n\nIf Republicans &amp; Trump have their way, millions could lose their health care in the middle of a global health crisis. The stakes could not be higher\u2014we must fight. SSI and VA beneficiaries: TODAY is the deadline to apply with the IRS to receive $500 dependent payments. Don\u2019t miss out on this last chance to receive this money. https://t.co/VH7hVUXLaq Here's something we can fix right now: we have a crisis of hunger and an economic crisis facing our restaurant industry, including farmers. Cities should be able to pay local restaurants to deliver meals to vulnerable people.\n\nI introduced the FEED Act today to ensure they can. My question to Rep. Ratcliffe in his confirmation hearing today to be the next DNI: do you believe Trump has accurately conveyed the severity of the threat of COVID-19 to the American people?\n \nHe said \"I believe so.\" But the facts say otherwise. https://t.co/H2eYnIQJF0 We're seeing a sharp increase in threats targeting Asian-American and other minority communities\u2014no doubt fueled by Trump's xenophobic statements.\n\nThat's why @SenatorDurbin and I are pushing Senate leadership for emergency funding to address hate crimes during the pandemic. Here's how likely minority-owned businesses are to be DENIED from PPP loans:\n\nBlack-owned: 95%\nLatino-owned: 91%\nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander-owned: 91%\nAsian-owned: 75%\n\nThis is not what an equitable COVID-19 response looks like. I'm working to fix it. You made a great choice, Jade! Congratulations and welcome to the @HowardU family. https://t.co/0Z9Klz9m2O So we're clear about Mitch McConnell's priorities this week: he's pushing to confirm Justin Walker, a 37 y/o conservative ideologue, to the DC Circuit Court.\n\nAnd on top of that, we already know this nominee has attacked SCOTUS's ruling upholding the ACA. https://t.co/gms4c2HEPg I said it after Hurricane Maria and I\u2019m saying it now: we need an accurate death count. It's critical to understanding COVID-19's impact.\n\nIn 2018, I passed a bill to study and ensure this\u2014but until that study is finished, FEMA needs to establish protocols for this pandemic, now. Absolutely unacceptable that Trump is prioritizing bailing out Big Oil companies while dragging his feet to support millions of unemployed people, workers, small businesses, and state and local governments. The American people are tired of this. California is once again leading the way. Essential workers deserve to have peace of mind that their children are taken care of while they are doing the critical work of getting us through this pandemic. Visit https://t.co/88yL7ADQV7 for more information. https://t.co/WKXXVa4sWW A new study found that unless we reduce the number of detained people in ICE detention centers, up to 100% of immigrants in custody could contract COVID-19 within 90 days. 100%.\n \nDHS needs to prioritize the release of low-risk and vulnerable people\u2014immediately. My new bill would create a COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force because this pandemic is highlighting deep racial disparities that have long existed in our country\u2014and we need to act. https://t.co/rya5AePPlX Right now, Attorney General Bill Barr has DOJ lawyers\u2014who work for taxpayers and the federal government\u2014in the Supreme Court trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Remember that. To small business owners in CA struggling to get PPP funds: know that I hear you and I'm pushing Mnuchin and the SBA to fix this.\n\nThis is especially frustrating when large companies are securing millions in loans. This won\u2019t stand, and I\u2019m demanding answers and accountability. We could not get through this pandemic without the tireless work of farm workers in California and across the nation. Heartening to see Californians come together to recognize their work like this.\n \nI'm fighting to ensure farm workers have the protections they need. https://t.co/Lb17TAE5xG Otay Mesa has the most COVID-19 cases of any ICE detention facility. That's why I called for an investigation into the treatment of people held there.\n\nThere's no question that low-risk and vulnerable detained persons need to be safely released to prevent the spread of the virus. https://t.co/PUxoOj7Gty This #MayDay and every day, I'm thinking about our essential workers who are working tirelessly to get us through this pandemic. We must do more to support them.\n\nThat means hazard pay, paid leave, and free COVID-19 tests and treatment regardless of their immigration status. Private debt collectors should not line their pockets with people\u2019s $1,200 direct payments while families struggle to feed their babies and pay the rent.\n\nGovernors are stepping up to prevent this\u2014I'm pushing Secretary Mnuchin to prohibit this nationwide. https://t.co/5EJgJwtT5p RT @RepGregoryMeeks: I wrote a letter with @SenKamalaHarris to SBA and Treasury regarding widespread reports that community banks, CDFIs an\u2026 Honored to be on this list as we kick off Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.\n\nOur AAPI community represents a rich diversity of cultures that make America stronger. We must continue fighting for equality for all AAPI people and speak out against the rise in racist attacks. https://t.co/MwyzfRVarP Funeral costs are simply unattainable when millions of people have lost their incomes.

This is huge and I'm proud to see the LA area leading the way.\n\nIt's critical that other jurisdictions move quickly to ensure safe elections in November. https://t.co/v11EOh67HW Andrea Circle Bear is the first woman to die in federal prison from COVID-19. She was pregnant, and her baby survived after being delivered by C-section. My heart is with her family and loved ones.\n\nDuring the pandemic, DOJ must release more pregnant women to home confinement. https://t.co/4J9BfZxETy It's May 1, meaning rent and bills are due for millions who have lost their incomes. A single $1,200 check is not enough when bills come every month.\n\nWe must send people money every single month throughout the pandemic. It\u2019s just common sense. Earlier today, I spoke about racial disparities and my new bill to create a Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force.\n\nWhat I said: we need an equitable response to this crisis that ensures vaccines and treatment are made available based on need and not just access. What is happening at Terminal Island prison is a public health crisis. More than half of the 1,055 inmates have tested positive for COVID-19. 4 have died.\n\nDOJ must step in to protect staff and inmates, and immediately release certain low-risk offenders. https://t.co/1kLlRNXQ4j Reminder that Mitch McConnell is bringing the Senate back into session next week with nothing on the schedule to address the coronavirus crisis. Instead, he wants to confirm more judges. In the middle of a pandemic. RT @kadiagoba: NEWS: Sen. Kamala Harris Is Introducing A Bill To Address The Racial Disparity In Coronavirus Cases And Deaths https://t.co/\u2026 Today, I'm announcing my new bill to create a COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force.\n\nWe need a serious, targeted effort to address the reality that Black and brown people are disproportionately being infected and dying from COVID-19 across the nation. https://t.co/AdFosf2yi4 Mitch McConnell is suggesting that the federal government should not help state and local governments on the frontlines of this crisis. So let\u2019s do the math and deconstruct this. https://t.co/i7z4RiMLKM Proud to work alongside @RepPressley to ensure minority-owned small businesses aren't shut out from the paycheck protection program.

We cannot praise the essential work of our immigrant community while continuing to shut so many of them out of coronavirus relief.\n\nOne thing I'm pushing for: ensuring everyone, regardless of their immigration status, has access to free testing and free treatment for COVID-19. https://t.co/A2ScRlM459 My heart is absolutely broken for Amber Isaac's family and loved ones. At just 26 years old, Amber passed away from complications after giving birth to her son.\n\nWe need to speak truth that this pandemic is highlighting deep racial disparities in our health care system. https://t.co/mPuJavyLct This is an outrage. More than 55,000 Americans have died from coronavirus and Senate Republicans still want to prioritize stacking our courts with ideologues.

Countless people are relying on credit cards just to put food on the table. We need a suspension of credit card interest, fees, and penalties\u2014now. It\u2019s shameful that large public companies have received millions in federal loans while mom-and-pop businesses continue to struggle.\n\nI'll say it again: Congress must prioritize minority &amp; underserved businesses that desperately need money to stay afloat. https://t.co/9tguPv9ASV We need to know whether politics has played a role in the Trump administration's COVID-19 response and distribution of critical resources.\n\nLast week, my colleagues and I sent a letter to HHS and FEMA's Inspectors General demanding broad investigations. I\u2019m proud that the Rainbow PUSH Coalition endorsed my VoteSafe Act over the weekend. This pandemic isn't close to being over and my bill will ensure voting is safe and accessible for all in November. https://t.co/SywuDbUSYm Thinking about these words today on what would have been the great Coretta Scott King's 93rd birthday: \u201cFreedom is never really won.

That's why I have a bill to help people put food on the table and ensure folks don\u2019t go hungry. https://t.co/ptZxIlqL1O FEMA has a long history of racial disparities in its disaster response\u2014and we're not going to stand for it, especially during a pandemic that\u2019s disproportionately impacting people of color.\n\nToday, I'm demanding FEMA address this issue and make transparent its plans to fix it. Marijuana small businesses employ more than 240,000 workers and should be allowed to access coronavirus relief funds too. My colleagues and I are pushing to ensure they\u2019re not left out of Congress\u2019s next relief package. People across the country are going hungry and debt collectors have the gall to try to seize the $1,200 direct payments. Unacceptable.\n\nI applaud this move by Governor @GavinNewsom and it's precisely why I'm pushing for it nationwide. Mnuchin needs to act on this immediately. https://t.co/oRfpWpk7P9 It was the height of irresponsibility to force people in Wisconsin to risk their lives in order to vote. We have to make sure this doesn't happen again.\n\nMy VoteSafe Act would ensure voting is safe and accessible for all. https://t.co/6qKiKhSZKb Let me emphasize what I told @JamilSmith: this pandemic is an opportunity to address longstanding issues that are now pounding on our door. That includes paid sick leave, health care disparities, and so much more. https://t.co/mNjjwc2gBW Wishing a blessed #Ramadan season to all those observing in California and around the world. These are difficult days and an important time to remember the power of reflection, compassion, and hope. Ramadan Mubarak. People desperately need these $1,200 payments to put food on the table and pay for necessities. It's outrageous that private debt collectors are trying to seize this money to line their pockets. I'm leading my colleagues in a push to stop this. https://t.co/w5Vad2gvqz Be sure to tune in to Power 106 in a few minutes at 10:40AM PT and listen to my interview @NickCannon! https://t.co/gjUpBdkNLz My new bill with @gillibrandny and @SenSanders will commit more resources so our most vulnerable people can afford food, because no one should go hungry\u2014especially in a public health crisis. https://t.co/h5S6CSFkzI It's simple: there's no more basic need than food, and right now countless people have lost their income and are going hungry.\n\nI'm announcing a new bill today to ensure people have enough food to get through the end of the month. Since January 2017, I've been asking the Trump administration this very question\u2014will they keep our country's promise that DACA recipients' personal information won't be used for immigration enforcement?\n\nThese young people deserve to know. https://t.co/dCzqSE7axR Fighting a virus means listening to doctors and following the science. If true, this is yet another brazen example of Trump caring more about scoring points than speaking truth and saving lives. An absolute failure of leadership. https://t.co/yKZQbi0IQU There's no sugar coating this. People will die because of Trump\u2019s commitment to rolling back major anti-pollution measures, and communities of color are already suffering the most. This is why we fight. #EarthDay https://t.co/CFOfJlaJMM At least 40 immigrant children in US custody have contracted coronavirus, and that number is likely to rise. It's our moral obligation to protect their health and safety first.\n\nToday, @RepEscobar and I are demanding the safe release of nearly 2,400 detained immigrant children. As we mark the 50th anniversary of #EarthDay, the success of our cause is more urgent than ever. In the midst of this deadly pandemic, Trump's dangerous environmental policies will cost lives\u2014particularly in communities of color. https://t.co/vsuwe8WxSy \"Of the 5.8 million people working health care jobs that pay less than $30,000 a year, half are nonwhite and 83 percent are women.\"\n\nWe could not fight this pandemic without women, in particular women of color. https://t.co/4spitdK81M This Holocaust Remembrance Day, we remember the six million Jewish people who were murdered and recommit ourselves to eliminating anti-Semitism across the globe. It is our moral responsibility to stand firm against bigotry and ensure this kind of hate never happens again. DEADLINE ALERT: Social security, railroad retirement, or VA beneficiaries\u2014TOMORROW by 9:00AM PST is the deadline to file with the IRS to receive a $500 dependent payment.\n\nCalifornians, please contact my office for assistance if you encounter any issues. https://t.co/WcrTcKxpCD And there\u2019s more. Congress must get back to work to:\n\n-Help people who can\u2019t make rent or mortgage payments\n-Stop private debt collection of cash payments\n-Aid cities and states on the frontlines\n-Help disproportionately impacted communities\n\nWe have so much more work to do. I support today's emergency bill to help small businesses and health care providers\u2014but I cannot overstate how insufficient this is.\n\nCongress is failing to help feed those who lost their income and are going hungry. We need to help families struggling to put food on the table. Small businesses in California have received the *least* PPP loans per capita of any state, and @SenFeinstein and I are demanding to know why.\n\nCA was the first to issue a stay-at-home order and our small businesses have been shut down longer than anywhere else. We need answers. Charging exorbitant prices for things like soap and hand sanitizer in the middle of a pandemic is immoral and dangerous. I introduced a bill to make price gouging illegal nationwide\u2014Congress must include it in the next relief package. The facts are indisputable. My colleagues and I on the Senate Intelligence Committee agree that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and did so to help Donald Trump.\n \nWe must do everything in our power to protect our elections\u2014now. https://t.co/1yPX0tsheP Black Americans shouldn't fear being targeted by law enforcement for wearing face masks during a pandemic. I'm pushing Attorney General Barr and FBI Directory Wray to require racial bias training for police. https://t.co/HtUGDxJJo5 Trump failed to take this crisis seriously from day 1. His abandonment of his role as president has cost lives. And now, he's shamelessly politicizing this pandemic to double down on his anti-immigrant agenda.\n\nEnough, Mr. President. The American people are fed up. https://t.co/pT5edXBIT5 Wildfire and hurricane season is approaching &amp; we will be tested in unprecedented ways because of the ongoing pandemic. FEMA must have a plan.\n\nI just led 80 members of Congress in a letter to FEMA demanding they outline natural disaster preparation &amp; recovery plans for COVID-19. This pandemic isn\u2019t close to being over, and yet the authorization for National Guard troops on the frontlines of responding to COVID-19 will soon expire. We need them to continue the fight in California and around the country.\n\nI\u2019m demanding Trump extend the authorization. The reality is that this pandemic is not affecting everyone equally. People of color, in particular Black communities, are being disproportionately impacted. I thank Beyonc\u00e9 for using her voice to speak this truth. https://t.co/z7Fxl3kMYx This virus impacts everyone\u2014it doesn't care about race, ethnicity, or immigration status. And that means vital COVID-19 resources must be available regardless of immigration status.\n\nOur bill would ensure immigrants aren't left out of critical coronavirus relief resources. https://t.co/Z7YVEsy6Vh It's time to legalize marijuana and bring justice to people of color harmed by failed drug policies. My bill to do that has already passed the House\u2014I remain committed to getting it passed in the Senate. Last week, I announced my new bill to provide $5 billion to ensure our elections are safe and accessible during the coronavirus pandemic. The right to vote is fundamental\u2014we must protect it. https://t.co/KBmvkzsEUE Trump said last month that anyone who wants a test for COVID-19 can get one. That's not true\u2014there still aren\u2019t nearly enough tests.\n \nThe American people need Trump to show leadership and ensure we produce the tests and supplies to adequately combat this crisis. Tomorrow marks another day that SCOTUS may rule on DACA and upend thousands of lives, including more than 200,000 essential workers on the frontlines of this pandemic.\n\nTo our DREAMers: I see you and no matter what, I will continue fighting for you to remain here in your home. Coronavirus doesn\u2019t care about race, political party, or immigration status. Yet in the middle of a pandemic, Otay Mesa Detention Center personnel reportedly withheld face masks until immigrant detainees signed waivers.\n \nUnacceptable. I'm demanding an investigation. https://t.co/DGGb4PkpyI Yesterday marked the end of Black Maternal Health Week, but let\u2019s be clear this is an issue that deserves our attention all year.\n\nBlack mothers are dying from pregnancy at higher rates and this pandemic could exacerbate those disparities. https://t.co/OfDnBQTrm3 Every person across the country, regardless of their immigration status, should have access to free testing and free treatment for COVID-19. I've been pushing for racial data on COVID-19 and I'm glad to see that the CDC has released some of this information. But we need to do more.\n \nPeople of color are disproportionately suffering from this pandemic. Congressional leaders must prioritize this disparity. https://t.co/rW6Df6oKwc All people living in the U.S. should participate in the 2020 Census. Participating is confidential and ensures your local community gets its share of transportation, education, and healthcare funding. \n\nVisit https://t.co/gW9kLYrgjl to make sure you're counted. Yesterday's unemployment numbers were staggering. 22 million Americans have now lost their jobs because of this pandemic.\n\nTo Mitch McConnell: Congress has to get back to work. People need to eat and keep a roof over their heads. That means ensuring monthly cash payments. Minority-owned businesses have long faced discriminatory banking practices. It's an outrage that this is still happening in a pandemic.\n \nI\u2019m pushing for more data on small business loans to ensure people of color aren't being shut out. Yesterday, I announced my new bill to ensure no American has to choose between their health and their right to vote.\n\nThat includes an additional $5 billion to ensure safe and accessible voting. https://t.co/9bz3ae2Hva I\u2019m concerned about recent reports of Black men being targeted by law enforcement based on CDC guidance to wear face masks.\n \nToday, @SenBooker and I led a letter to AG Barr and FBI Director Wray demanding law enforcement training to combat racial profiling in this pandemic. https://t.co/tH19hGfxp9 Unacceptable that debt collectors are cashing in on people's $1,200 direct payments. Americans are in dire need of money to pay their rent and put food on the table\u2014this is absurd.\n \nI'm leading my colleagues today in a push to end this. https://t.co/PQFBe69ogh Earlier today, I announced my new bill to confront the barriers to voting that are being magnified by the pandemic. The VoteSafe Act will authorize $5 billion to:\n\n-require universal early voting\n-expand vote-by-mail\n-ensure safe &amp; accessible in-person voting to those who need it RT @aijenpoo: When your job, by definition, takes place in someone else\u2019s household, working from home isn't an option.  \n\nDomestic workers\u2026 No one should be forced to choose between their health and their right to vote. I announced a new bill today to authorize $5 billion to expand early voting and vote-by-mail, and ensure safe in-person voting. https://t.co/KBmvkzsEUE RT @craigmelvin: @SenKamalaHarris unveils new plan to \u201caccommodate voting in this era of a pandemic\u201d \n\n-Extending curbside voting\n-Access f\u2026 Black communities are disproportionately suffering from COVID-19.

We have to fight back.\n\nToday, I\u2019m announcing the VoteSafe Act to protect every American's fundamental right to vote. https://t.co/FG4lTok7UN This is the right move by the Bureau of Prisons and precisely why my colleagues and I pushed for it earlier this month. But let\u2019s be clear: it\u2019s absurd to charge inmates fees for phone calls in the first place. https://t.co/mBjqLRSxon At Otay Mesa Detention Center, immigrants were reportedly asked to sign waivers to get face masks. In the middle of a pandemic.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m calling for an investigation into the conditions at Otay Mesa. https://t.co/HsrPKvIS4e This pandemic has blown the lid off something many of us have known our entire lives: there are deep racial disparities in our country\u2019s health care system.\n\nThis Black Maternal Health Week, it's critical that we speak truth about the ongoing crisis of Black maternal mortality. https://t.co/YHlJUCRCn6 Today, I'm demanding an investigation into the treatment of people held at Otay Mesa Detention Center. Otay Mesa has the most COVID-19 cases of any ICE immigration detention facility and DHS isn't doing enough to prevent inhumane conditions.\n\nWe need answers and accountability. RT @BMHCaucus: \"We can\u2019t let up the fight to address maternal mortality in America \u2013 especially right now.\" Read a #BlackMaternalHealthWeek\u2026 Coronavirus appears to be disproportionately killing people of color and Congress needs to wake up and address this injustice. Today, I'm pushing Senate leadership to prioritize funding to combat racial health disparities in COVID-19 testing and outcomes. .@AOC is right. FEMA provides Disaster Funeral Assistance for natural disasters\u2014but not pandemics. There's no reason for this.\n\nLast month, I introduced a bill to fix that. https://t.co/GvnHLxOgxL Black Americans are infected and dying from COVID-19 at alarming rates, and we need demographic data to understand the full scope of the issue.\n\nProud to join my colleagues on a bill today to require the federal government to collect and report this data. Racial disparities in health care existed long before the coronavirus pandemic\u2014especially when it comes to the maternal health of Black women. https://t.co/OaufZFMgOS Too many minority-owned businesses are being left out of coronavirus relief programs. And the truth is that our neighborhoods won't look the same without these businesses.\n\nThe administration must do more to prioritize relief for them. https://t.co/VbqZ8Qobe7 This can\u2019t be missed from the weekend: instead of trying to support and protect all essential frontline farm workers, the administration is seeking to lower wages for some of them. This is absurd\u2014we must fight for all farm workers. https://t.co/yPeH4C7Gvv COVID-19 doesn't care about the party with which you're registered to vote. Congress needs to come together to pass additional relief. That has to include:\n\n-free coronavirus treatment\n-more support for small businesses\n-paid sick leave for all, and more. https://t.co/VxnPD7McfJ Today, I'm proud to reintroduce a resolution with @RepAdams to recognize this week as Black Maternal Health Week. We need to confront the reality that Black mothers are dying at higher rates from pregnancy-related causes. The IRS has started to disburse the $1,200 payments, but we must continue the fight for recurring monthly payments. One-time payments are not enough to get our country through this crisis. The past two months have made clear that the federal government was unprepared to confront the coronavirus pandemic. I'm proud to help introduce this bill to ensure these mistakes don\u2019t happen again. https://t.co/b3sOhGswh5 Last week, I called for a suspension of credit card interest, fees, and penalties because no one should profit off of those who are hurting in the midst of this pandemic. https://t.co/BCxFIvGuVb The Otay Mesa immigration detention center in San Diego now has the most COVID-19 cases of any detention facility. DHS has failed to take sufficient action to protect vulnerable people in these facilities. That needs to change\u2014now. https://t.co/Wt3Hx5fVrP It's important to hold onto moments of joy in the midst of these difficult days. Wishing everyone renewed hope and happiness this Easter Sunday!\n\nMy tip for those celebrating away from loved ones: call or video chat instead of text\u2014it's so much better to hear people's voices. RT @Elex_Michaelson: \"No one should be profiting off their desperation to feed their children...\"\n\n@SenKamalaHarris is calling for a suspen\u2026 Grateful to @RepRashida, @RepPressley, @RepRaskin, @repcleaver, @RepEscobar, @Ilhan, and @RepAOC for their leadership  on this issue. People are hurting and need recurring monthly payments to get through this crisis\u2014now. Even before this pandemic began, nearly half of Americans were a $400 unexpected expense away from financial disaster.\n\nA one-time direct payment isn't enough\u2014we need recurring monthly payments. That's why I'm pushing Congressional leaders on this very issue. The coronavirus pandemic is highlighting long-existing racial disparities in our health care system that Black communities know all too well. As we begin Black Maternal Health Week, we must also speak truth about the crisis afflicting Black mothers and babies. https://t.co/BiAWeLprtm Any week now, SCOTUS may rule on DACA and upend the lives of thousands of young people. It\u2019s unconscionable to issue a ruling when over 200,000 DACA recipients are essential workers in this crisis, including 29,000 in the health care industry.\n\nSCOTUS must delay its ruling. Millions of people have just lost their jobs and are relying on credit cards to feed themselves and their families. No one should profit off of this pain in the middle of a pandemic.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m calling for a suspension of credit card interest, fees, and penalties. Exploiting people who are suffering during this pandemic is immoral. Price gouging on household necessities only adds unnecessary stress for people just trying to get by. Proud today to introduce a bill to make price gouging illegal nationwide. https://t.co/adKpLkxIV9 Right now, many public defenders are still showing up in courtrooms to keep vulnerable people out of overcrowded jails and to advocate for sentencing reductions. It's time for Congress to support this critical work.\n\n@RepTedDeutch &amp; I are pushing for more public defender funding. RT @kron4news: VIDEO: A one-on-one with @SenKamalaHarris\nhttps://t.co/dEyskKmdtH 28 million people across the country were uninsured before this pandemic began. They need a chance to sign up for a health care plan in the middle of a deadly pandemic. An immigrant woman gave birth standing up, delivering her baby into her pants, while holding onto a garbage can for support at a border patrol station. This is utterly despicable. I\u2019m demanding an investigation. https://t.co/UT0rtGq9L8 I stand with the fast food workers across California today protesting insufficient protections against COVID-19. They are putting their lives at risk to keep these businesses running and deserve hazard pay, protective equipment, paid sick leave and more. https://t.co/6eNBEHaKto Bodegas.\nFood trucks.\nConvenience stores.\nBarber shops and nail salons.\n\nOur neighborhoods won't be the same without businesses like these that are overwhelmingly owned by people of color. The Small Business Administration needs to do more to help minority-owned businesses. One-time payments are not enough. People need more money in their pockets, and sending monthly payments to workers and families is the best way to address that need.\n\nToday, I led more than 50 members of Congress in pushing leadership for recurring monthly cash payments. This pandemic is exploiting long existing environmental injustices all across the country. Clean air is a human right but too many communities are suffering from toxic air pollution. We must fight for clean air for all. https://t.co/JewwDkJ9U7 Republicans just blocked a critical bill to aid small businesses, all because it also included help for communities on the frontlines, hospitals, and nutrition benefits for those going hungry. Shameful.\n\nConfronting this crisis requires helping ALL who need it. Passover reminds us of the importance of renewed hope and the promise of new beginnings. To all those celebrating\u2014I hope you have a wonderful holiday and find moments of joy in the midst of these difficult days. Earlier today, I called for an immediate suspension of credit card interest, fees, and penalties. No one should profit off of people who are hurting right now. https://t.co/oqwp8bL61H Farm workers have always been essential, and it's long past time they received the protections they deserve. That includes ensuring these workers who put food on our tables have access to COVID-19 testing, treatment, and so much more. https://t.co/F82sPr2hfJ Confronting the racial disparities in COVID-19 cases and deaths means speaking truth about historic inequalities impacting vulnerable people, in particular Black communities. https://t.co/5T0KlxP5xm This is critical and will save health workers' lives. Grateful every day for Governor @GavinNewsom and the countless state officials in California who are working tirelessly to meet the challenges we\u2019re facing today. https://t.co/9cBCRybubm I'm calling for an immediate suspension of credit card interest, fees, and penalties for the duration of this crisis.\n\nNo one should profit off of Americans who have just lost their income.

We won't stand for it. https://t.co/MITRK7P9ls Early reports indicate that Black Americans are dying at alarming rates from COVID-19. This is why I called on HHS to collect and report demographic data on testing, treatment, and fatalities across the country. We need to confront this reality now. https://t.co/M2d1XvyjJO Thousands of people are sitting in jails right now, facing serious illness or death from COVID-19, simply because they can't afford to make bail. I applaud California for taking this step\u2014we need it nationwide. https://t.co/xLy8JfDm8j I'll say it again: pandemics and wildfires are not unrelated issues. California lives depend on whether the federal government is prepared for wildfires in the middle of this public health crisis. https://t.co/oKhrzdiMCC This decision forces many voters to choose between risking their lives by standing in long lines or being shut out from voting.\n\nWe have an obligation to ensure voting is safe. This is why I\u2019m writing a bill to ensure safe access to the polls\u2014including with shorter lines. https://t.co/ML9OLHR9KI To every health care worker on the frontlines of this pandemic: thank you. Our entire country is with you in this moment. https://t.co/3qFjqy0akx Election season is underway and this pandemic is already posing unprecedented challenges to in-person voting. Congress must provide states with the resources to conduct vote-by-mail, as well as safe in-person voting.\n\nI'm working on a bill to ensure just that. Reminder that if you\u2019ve recently lost health insurance due to a layoff, you are eligible to enroll in an Affordable Care Act plan.\n\nBut we have to be clear that this isn\u2019t enough. In the middle of this pandemic, Trump must make open enrollment available to everyone. Next week is the earliest Americans will begin receiving their direct payments. Some will have to wait months. This is absurd.\n\nIRS must move quickly to disburse these payments right away. People need this money in their pockets now. https://t.co/oK90xgCZXh It\u2019s not enough to \u201cease\u201d restrictions on blood donations that discriminate against gay and bisexual men. Now more than ever we need a policy based on risk, not one that discriminates based on identity. https://t.co/SNtFuo8z1W Native American communities in rural areas are especially vulnerable to the spread of coronavirus, and yet their needs are still not being prioritized. We need significant investments in tribal and native communities now more than ever. https://t.co/wr6uD7sg7v Immigrant children don\u2019t belong in detention, especially in the middle of a pandemic when a number of them and staff are showing symptoms of coronavirus. For the safety of these children\u2019s lives, HHS must accelerate their release. https://t.co/y9rbvyJVlJ We deserve to know how the Trump administration is making decisions about where to send precious resources to combat COVID-19.\n \nLast week, I sent a letter to Vice President Mike Pence, FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor, and HHS Secretary Alex Azar demanding answers on this. All frontline workers\u2014including health care workers, farm workers, first responders, domestic workers, and grocery workers\u2014deserve hazard pay for the duration of this pandemic. The day before he was assassinated, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said these words: \u201cOnly when it is dark enough, can you see the stars.\u201d\n\nThose words are especially meaningful today. No matter how dark these days may seem, we will get through it. Trump's intentional failure to appoint inspectors general makes clear his hostility to being held accountable. This is especially irresponsible w/ the unprecedented scale of the federal response to COVID-19.\n\nI'm demanding Trump move quickly to fill IG vacancies. This can't wait. The firing of the Intelligence Community\u2019s IG is dangerous. It is further evidence Trump will do anything he can to escape oversight and will punish anyone who isn\u2019t \u201cloyal.\u201d\n\nEven in the midst of a deadly pandemic, the president is obsessed with settling scores over impeachment. https://t.co/qvqu4QPQ3Z Hey @blackwomenviews, I\u2019m answering your question! And here\u2019s the deal: this crisis is highlighting disparities in our health care system that existed long before COVID-19. We have to start by gathering demographic data on testing, treatment, and fatalities. https://t.co/j0rKA04kM2 COVID-19 does not care about your race, ethnicity, gender, age, or immigration status. It's critical for immigrants to have access to the vital resources we all need during this crisis, regardless of their status.\n\nToday, I announced a bill with @MazieHirono to ensure just that. @Craig_A_Spencer Craig, you and your colleagues are doing the work of heroes. We cannot thank you enough, and I promise I will continue fighting to ensure you have all the support you need. 1 in 5 health care workers in America was born in another country, and many have immigration status. They are heroes in the midst of this pandemic.\n\nI'm calling for all health care workers to maintain their immigration status throughout this crisis. It's the right thing to do. Reducing the incarcerated population is critical to preventing the spread of coronavirus in prisons. This is the right move and I\u2019m proud to see California leading the way. https://t.co/FFfXdUzkj9 Guaranteed paid sick leave for all workers.\nSuspend negative credit reporting.\nFree coronavirus testing and treatment.\nNational ban on all evictions and foreclosures.\n\nThese are some of the things I\u2019m fighting for. Our work in Congress isn\u2019t done. https://t.co/YN1rl8n2fC The increased profiling, intimidation, and hate towards Asian-Americans and Asian immigrants is simply inexcusable.\n\nToday, I announced a resolution with @MazieHirono and @SenDuckworth to condemn these racist acts and make it loud and clear that they have no place in America. People are losing their jobs and health insurance. Small business owners are losing their life\u2019s work. Workers are still being forced to choose between staying home sick or putting food on the table. Millions have filed for unemployment.\n\nCongress must get back to work\u2014now. This was 50 days ago. https://t.co/zp4iuULd9R These unemployment numbers are staggering. The American people are hurting. Leaders in Washington, D.C. must immediately take up additional emergency measures to help families and small businesses.\n\nMitch McConnell must call the Senate back into session. We have work to do. Now. https://t.co/rV5T6u0UlG Earlier today I spoke with California mayors and one thing is clear: the vacuum of leadership from Trump has shifted leadership to our mayors, and they are doing extraordinary work. https://t.co/6FwOMrIs1k RT @SignalBoostShow: Guest @SenKamalaHarris told @ZerlinaMaxwell &amp; @jess_mc that there's definitely a crisis of leadership coming from the\u2026 If you're able to stay at home right now, one good thing you can accomplish is completing the 2020 Census.

We have to fight this. https://t.co/Q9dYLAg8S6 Rent is due today and Americans need the $1,200 payment in their pockets right now. I'm calling on the IRS to disburse these payments immediately.\n\nAnd let\u2019s also be clear about this: these $1,200 payments aren\u2019t nearly enough. Congress must do more. This pandemic has caused a severe blood shortage, yet the FDA still enforces an outdated, discriminatory policy that effectively bans gay and bisexual men from donating blood.\n\nWe\u2019re calling on the FDA to end this policy. https://t.co/bdNkXgd9UR Trump refuses to open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act for those uninsured in the middle of a pandemic. This is an absolute failure of leadership from the White House. Everyone should be outraged.\n\nWe need a nationwide special enrollment period\u2014now. https://t.co/tlTKKLwy1H Today is #TransDayOfVisibility and I want the transgender community to know:\n \nYou are seen.\nYou are heard.\nYou are loved.\n\nAnd we will continue to fight for your right to be who you are.

There\u2019s just no excuse for the White House\u2019s slow and bungled response to this public health emergency. Tomorrow is April 1, which means rent is due for countless Americans who have just lost their jobs or small businesses.\n \nI just sent a letter to the Treasury Department demanding they expedite the $1,200 direct payments. People need this money in their pockets right now. C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez knew that farm workers are the backbone of America, and this pandemic has reaffirmed that truth. \n\nYears after he launched a historic farm workers movement, we must recommit ourselves to his fight for justice for the people who put food on our tables. #CesarChavezDay In the middle of a pandemic, Trump gutted clean car standards that directly impact Americans\u2019 health.\n\nThis is shameful and dangerous during a public health crisis. We will fight this. https://t.co/wHuf4oXvTe A one-time $1,200 payment is nowhere near enough. Americans are worried about how they\u2019re going to pay their rent and bills this week. Congress must do more\u2014ASAP. Hey @altifbrown, I\u2019m answering your question! And you\u2019re absolutely right. One-time payments are not enough in the middle of this pandemic. https://t.co/5qK8GGwkOF Last week, I held a call with @CHIRLA and immigrant rights leaders on the need to protect immigrant families during this pandemic. One thing is clear: these are unprecedented times and immigrant communities are more fearful than ever.\n\nWe must keep fighting to protect them. There\u2019s no question Congress should be in DC working on our next bill to help people during this crisis. Americans are still hurting and our work isn\u2019t done. https://t.co/1nQFgfVgEr RT @CAgovernor: \u27a1\ufe0f 90-day grace period for mortgage payments \n\u27a1\ufe0f No negative credit impacts resulting from relief \n\u27a1\ufe0f 60-day moratorium on\u2026 We must suspend wage garnishment, car repossessions, credit card interest and penalties, and any negative credit reporting for the duration of the pandemic (including for at least 120 days after this is over). Right now, approximately 27,000 DACA recipients work in the health care industry and thousands more are essential workers. It\u2019s outrageous that SCOTUS may rule on DACA in the middle of this pandemic. https://t.co/17rQuf52Vx Hey Brian and Milan, I\u2019m answering your questions about how Doug and I are holding up during this crisis.

RT @MARCMORIAL: URGENT: The Trump Administration cannot be allowed to use the #Coronavirus crisis as an excuse to suspend civil rights laws\u2026 At least 35 health care workers in California have tested positive for COVID-19. Trump must use the full force of the Defense Production Act so our health care workers have the protective equipment they need. There\u2019s no reason to delay this any longer. Many incarcerated people are at high risk if they contract the coronavirus. We have to do the right thing and prioritize their safety.\n\nEarlier this week, I joined a bill to place certain vulnerable, non-violent incarcerated people in community supervision outside of prison. Too often, our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico and U.S. territories are overlooked in times of crisis. We can\u2019t let that happen in the middle of a pandemic.\n\nIf you live in these areas, know that I see you and I\u2019m fighting for you. Hey @LisaAnnWalter, I'm answering your question!\n\nAnd I want you to know that I'm fighting every day to make sure this support gets to gig workers as soon as possible. https://t.co/c0SXTs2Nqz Earlier today, I spoke with the Acting Secretary of the @USNavy in part to extend my deep gratitude to the crew of USNS Mercy for supporting California during this crisis. They are heroes. https://t.co/4WLLdX5nDb @SRuhle It was my pleasure, and tell Louise I hope she takes good care. This shouldn't go unnoticed. As we're fighting a public health crisis, Trump is continuing to roll back environmental and public health protections. Utterly shameless. https://t.co/7TC8kYJNxQ SCOTUS suspended arguments because they know the threat coronavirus poses. They must take this crisis into consideration on a DACA decision too.\n\nThis could upend the lives of 700,000 young people, including many on the front lines who are working as health care practitioners. The Senate passed historic legislation this week but Congress\u2019 job is nowhere close to being finished. We have so much more to do to provide assistance to families and small businesses, expand paid leave, protect homeowners and renters, and more. Huge thank you to everyone for all of your questions. A lot of you are asking about personal protective equipment for our health care workers. So, my first response goes to Jonathan from Modesto, CA. https://t.co/3Imx2A168D My home-state has announced that 1 million Californians have filed for unemployment since March 13. 1 million.\n\nThe Senate has passed legislation to dramatically expand unemployment insurance but let\u2019s be clear that this is just a start. I won\u2019t let up the fight for Californians.

Any talk by supposed leaders of life going back to normal by Easter is just plain wrong. The American people need us to speak truth. It\u2019s important to me that I hear from you directly during this public health crisis. So reply to this post with your coronavirus-related question and where you\u2019re from. I\u2019ll respond to as many as I can in the coming days. https://t.co/dGHBVwRseb Today\u2019s bill isn\u2019t perfect, but I voted for it because workers, small businesses &amp; health care providers need this help right now.\n\nBut our work isn\u2019t done. We need more action to address the pain this pandemic is inflicting on everyday Americans. I won\u2019t stop fighting for that. With countless American lives upended because of the coronavirus, there\u2019s no question that we need to open a special enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act. Immediately. https://t.co/nXwRu8ZQXi The bill provides $30 billion to protect students and help schools, colleges and universities combat the coronavirus. This is $13 million.\n\n$13 million = .04% of $30 billion\n\nWhy do you take issue with money going to Howard, Congressman? https://t.co/7nyaijShhd My colleagues and I are pushing for the immediate cancellation of federal student loan payments for the duration of the pandemic. And we should also cancel at least $10,000 of student debt for all borrowers. There is a failure of leadership at the White House when supposed leaders are discussing putting profits before saving lives. It\u2019s despicable, and it\u2019s not who we are. Far too many health care workers are risking their lives right now because there isn\u2019t enough protective equipment. This shouldn't happen in America.\n\nWe introduced a bill to drastically increase the production of medical supplies and personal protective equipment. In the middle of a pandemic, Republicans proposed excluding some health centers, disability providers, and nursing homes from receiving federal assistance. Even rape crisis centers.\n\nAnd they did this while proposing corporate bailouts. Disgraceful.\nhttps://t.co/3n1JzIZjhF We need a ban on all evictions, foreclosures, and repossessions nationwide for the duration of the pandemic. Hey @ICEgov, why are you requesting 45,000 N95 masks for immigration \u201cremovals\u201d in the middle of a deadly pandemic? Our health care providers are trying to save lives and need these masks. We need clear answers on your priorities during this crisis. https://t.co/w64FQ8LJp6 RT @SFBART: BART continues to serve thousands of essential workers who ride to and from work.\n\nToday we spoke to some of them.

Everyone should be outraged that this is happening to our friends, neighbors, and in our communities.\n\nWe are so much better than this. https://t.co/LtBYpKftZA Millions of Americans right now are wondering how they\u2019re going to make their rent or mortgage payments in April. They have to be our priority. Not corporations, not CEOs, and not Wall Street. Let\u2019s remember that without our farm workers in California and across the country, there would be no food on our tables to get us through this pandemic. I\u2019m grateful for their work, not just today but every day.\n https://t.co/xoMiUXGOj2 Certain low-risk inmates should be released from prisons to prevent the spread of coronavirus. That includes those who are awaiting trial because they don\u2019t have enough money to make bail. Our economy is made up of working people like cashiers, domestic workers, farm workers, small business owners, truck drivers, and teachers.\n\nYes, Congress must take major action to help our economy. But our focus must be on helping working people\u2014not CEOs and Wall Street. RT @SenSchumer: From the beginning, Democrats have insisted on more money for our hospitals, our medical system, and our medical workers\n\nF\u2026 Months ago, I led a resolution in support of America's oldest civil rights law to ensure people of color could pursue certain race discrimination claims in federal court.\n\nToday, SCOTUS ruled to narrow that law. This decision will have harmful consequences. https://t.co/hWpw3eo7lk RT @MayorOfLA: The COVID-19 crisis is no time to play politics with people's lives. Emergency resources must be available to everyone impac\u2026 On the 10 year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, we\u2019re reminded of a fundamental truth: health care is a right for all and not a privilege for the few. We must keep fighting to ensure that. https://t.co/M0WiI0UwlF Monthly cash payments.\nPaid family and sick leave.\nStudent loan forgiveness.\nBan on all evictions and foreclosures.\n \nThese are the things the Senate should be prioritizing to help Americans who are hurting right now\u2014not corporate handouts. Californians: note that the deadline for filing state taxes has also been extended to July 15. https://t.co/fVABYmX1fT I just voted NO on the corporate wishlist that Republicans put on the table today to address the pandemic. Everyday Americans are suffering and this plan puts the needs of corporations over working people. It fails to meet the urgent demands of the moment\u2014we have to do better. Confronting this public health and economic crisis requires a serious bipartisan response. McConnell's draft is anything but that.\n\nIt's a corporate wishlist that gives handouts to big businesses and neglects those who require the most help\u2014and need it now. A total nonstarter. .@RepJudyChu is absolutely right. The rhetoric coming out of the White House is fanning the flames for racist and xenophobic attacks against Asian Americans and Asian immigrants in America. It's on all of us to call out and condemn this. https://t.co/OjHMt0kk3s -ban all evictions, foreclosures, and repossessions nationwide for the duration of the pandemic;\n-suspend penalties for missed payments and any negative consumer credit reporting;\n-prohibit consumer debt collection and wage garnishment.\n\nAnything less than this is not enough. It's clear to me that we need to expand consumer protections to prevent working people from being defrauded and abused by those trying to take advantage of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThese are the things I'm fighting for: This is an outrage. I called for significant investments in tribal and native communities because we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic and their needs are too often not a priority. They need these funds now more than ever. https://t.co/8qR5xNXpcB Heartbreaking. Doug and I are holding @RepDeSaulnier, his family and staff in our hearts right now. Join us in doing the same. https://t.co/ZAJQrTqnKA I saw Airickca just a few weeks ago and I\u2019m heartbroken to learn of her passing. My heart goes out to her mother, family, and loved ones. It\u2019s on us to continue her fight for racial equality and to ensure America never forgets the legacy of her cousin, Emmett Till. https://t.co/r1FZkVKhzP This is a good first step but we have to do more to prevent evictions &amp; protect working people.\n\nEvictions during a pandemic will only make this public health crisis worse. Grateful for California\u2019s leaders &amp; mayors who have been pushing for this. It\u2019s just the right thing to do. https://t.co/uTkgzVURNx Earlier this week I introduced a bill to allow millions more people to access unemployment and food assistance in a pandemic. That would include Uber and Lyft drivers, more domestic workers, immigrant children, and so many more.\n\nWe have to get this done. This is precisely why I\u2019m pushing the Bureau of Prisons to release certain low-risk inmates, including those who are incarcerated simply because they can\u2019t afford bail. BOP must do this immediately to minimize the spread of coronavirus in prisons. https://t.co/48xbsS6n50 During this pandemic, many Californians have lost their jobs and health insurance. If you currently don't have health insurance, note that Covered California has opened a special enrollment period. Visit https://t.co/KD55YchwBF for more information. https://t.co/K9g1ysKUxU The last thing that DHS should be prioritizing right now is preparing for mass deportations of DREAMers. With the Supreme Court decision expected by June, my colleagues and I sent a letter today demanding answers about what DHS intends to do. In the past week, I've contacted the State Department on behalf of more than 50 Californians who are stuck in other countries. Many have had difficulty contacting U.S. embassies.\n\nI just sent a letter to @SecPompeo demanding a plan to ensure my constituents safely return home. Trump is not listening. The lack of coronavirus testing is a big problem in California and across the country. https://t.co/xW3WGJySPU We cannot leave the most vulnerable behind. Congress MUST stand up for those who are hurting the most.\n\nYesterday I introduced a bill to use FEMA resources to help millions more with unemployment, food, child care, and medical assistance. We must pass it\u2014now. Mitch McConnell\u2019s proposal gets it backwards and leaves working people behind. It provides:\n\n-the least help to the people who need it most;\n-tax giveaways for the biggest corporations;\n-and neglects paid sick leave for workers.\n\nWe have to do better. Right now there are dozens of Californians stuck in other countries who have contacted my office during this pandemic so they can come home. It\u2019s critical that the State Department do everything it can to get them home safe and healthy. This can\u2019t wait. RT @GavinNewsom: CA is issuing a statewide, mandatory STAY AT HOME order.\n \nThose that work in critical sectors should go to work. Grocery\u2026 Right now, FEMA can't help people with unemployment or food assistance because pandemics aren't considered natural disasters. There's no good reason for this.\n\nI just introduced a bill to fix this so that FEMA can treat this pandemic like a disaster and help people now. We cannot think of pandemics and natural disasters as separate issues. Our federal government has to be prepared for wildfires and earthquakes in the middle of this public health crisis. The lives of people in California will depend on it. https://t.co/XPE2e82A6D Last night, I announced my 5 priorities for Congress' next coronavirus emergency package.\n\nHere's my bottom line: we need a federal response that puts working families and small businesses first. With these five priorities, we can ensure that\u2019s a reality. https://t.co/uFbQYPu2fm Individuals in detention are especially vulnerable to the spread of coronavirus &amp; the Bureau of Prisons must take steps to ensure their safety.\n\nI'm pushing BOP to release all low-risk inmates, including those who are in pretrial detention because they can't afford to make bail. -Direct cash assistance\n-No interest loans for small businesses &amp; more protections for families\n-Expand public assistance, including food stamps &amp; unemployment\n-No ICE raids that endanger public health\n-Fair treatment for tribes and territories\n\nWe can and should do all of this. Earlier today, Congress passed emergency legislation to address the coronavirus pandemic. But one thing\u2019s for sure\u2014we have to do more.\n\nThat's why right now, I\u2019m laying out five priorities that I'm fighting for in the next legislative package: RT @DerrickNAACP: For the @NAACP re: #Coronavirus, we are most concerned with the most vulnerable in our community. We\u2019re also concerned wi\u2026 I just voted YES on the Families First Coronavirus Response Act. This bill will provide 10 days of paid sick leave and 3 months of paid family leave for many workers, and coronavirus testing at no cost.\n\nBut let's be clear: this bill is a start and Congress must do more. Millions of people in America speak a language other than English in their home. The CDC must make coronavirus guidance accessible to everyone. This lack of preparedness is completely unacceptable. https://t.co/if5YqIVyzW There's no question that detained people are especially vulnerable to the spread of coronavirus.\n\nToday I'm demanding information from ICE and CBP on coronavirus preparedness in their facilities to protect individuals in U.S. custody, staff, and the public. They must have a plan. Thank a health care provider today and every day. They are the real heroes during this public health crisis. RT @CalVolunteers: There are plenty of ways to safely help out while following health officials' guidance on #COVID19. Here are some option\u2026 I called on Mitch McConnell to cancel the weekend because we should have been here to address the pandemic.

The American people cannot wait. https://t.co/iZ1eTLTjFE Let me be clear\u2014I wrote the LIFT Act in 2018 because I believe we have always had a duty to help working families. My bill provides up to $500 not once, but every. single. month.\n\nDuring this crisis, we must do much more. I'm working to shape a robust new bill to help families. We cannot ignore the strain that emergency situations like the coronavirus pandemic put on many families who are already living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nI introduced the LIFT Act to give working families up to $500 a month. We need it now more than ever. Right now is a difficult time for sexual assault survivors who may be forced to stay at home with an abuser.\n\nIf you are in this position, call 1-800-656-4673 to reach the National Sexual Assault Hotline or visit https://t.co/eo0Wsii3KO if you are unable to call.

We need real leadership now more than ever. https://t.co/vXDajbKd9w Immigrants shouldn't fear going to a hospital in the middle of a pandemic.\n\nToday, I\u2019m calling on DHS Official Ken Cuccinelli to make a public statement that ICE and CBP will avoid immigration enforcement in public health facilities during the coronavirus pandemic. The 6+ hour lines in airports this weekend were downright hazardous in the middle of a pandemic. I'm calling on Republican leaders to immediately hold oversight hearings with CBP to address it. This cannot continue. Yesterday I joined the @NAACP on a call to discuss how we can protect our communities against the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOne point I made: check in on our elderly. Give them a call to brighten their day. Offer to get them groceries. Remember that isolation can lead to depression. With so much going on, it remains critical that every person in America fills out the Census. Right now through March 20, invitations to complete the Census will begin arriving in mailboxes. You have a right to be counted and to ensure your community is represented. Californians, please heed these safety precautions announced today by Governor @GavinNewsom to combat the coronavirus.

The Senate shouldn\u2019t wait until next week to vote on the emergency coronavirus bill the House has already passed.\n\nMitch McConnell\u2014call the Senate back immediately to vote on this bill. We need to act. In the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, water, electricity, internet and phone companies shouldn\u2019t cut off services to customers who can\u2019t pay their bill.

Here's the bottom line: paid sick leave will save lives and will keep communities safer. It's just that basic. https://t.co/CU6t01QcvV Reminder that just 2 days ago, Republican Senators blocked our bill to guarantee emergency paid sick leave to workers affected by the coronavirus. The House is set to take up emergency legislation to address the coronavirus, including to provide paid sick leave and make testing free for all.\n\nMitch McConnell must cancel the weekend so the Senate can immediately vote on this bill. The American people need us to act. Previous administrations\u2014both Republican and Democratic\u2014have allowed states flexibility with Medicaid in times of crisis. There is simply no reason to deny this to states today in the middle of a pandemic. Disgraceful. https://t.co/aPeTke1Hvw .@RepKatiePorter got the Director of the CDC to commit to free coronavirus testing for every American. This is so important and will save lives. The CDC must follow through on this immediately. https://t.co/IdlxzR3Jes The threat of coronavirus is real and we have to consider the impact on our most vulnerable populations\u2015including in prisons.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons must have a plan to help prevent the spread of coronavirus to incarcerated individuals and staff.

My heart goes out to their family.\n\nThis is a public health crisis and I remain committed to working with federal, state and local officials to address it. https://t.co/SS3GHZ2zZY There is simply no reason to deny children a loving home because of discriminatory policies against LGBTQ+ couples. @RepSeanMaloney\u2019s story is truly touching\u2014watch his testimony. https://t.co/wKcGox0dza Coronavirus is a serious threat to our public health and the Senate must act to help fight its spread.\n\nI\u2019ve sent a letter to Mitch McConnell demanding he take up emergency funding as soon as the House sends it over. We cannot afford a delay. As Americans head to the polls today to cast their vote, let\u2019s not forget that communities of color continue to face barriers to the ballot box. We cannot stop fighting until these voter suppression efforts are eliminated. Students from HBCUs and Hispanic-serving institutions shouldn\u2019t face higher interest rates on their loans simply for attending these schools\u2014period.\n\nWe\u2019ve sent a letter to private lenders demanding answers. https://t.co/98WodXrO2r Today is Election Day in 14 states across America, including California. The very foundation of our democracy relies on every American exercising their right to vote. Make sure that you do so today.\n\nCalifornians, note that vote-by-mail ballots must be postmarked by today. We cannot overlook the burden that outbreaks like the coronavirus have on low-income workers who aren\u2019t guaranteed paid sick leave. No one in America should be forced to choose between a paycheck and their health. https://t.co/aefiBy4Ep5 This is dangerous and unacceptable. Big Oil's climate misinformation playbook is at work in our government. California is facing a water crisis and our policies must be informed with science fact, not fiction. https://t.co/7Goxp5Mcxz A reminder that last month, the House passed legislation to provide earthquake relief for Puerto Rico. Our fellow Americans are still suffering from the aftermath of these natural disasters. The Senate must bring this bill to the floor\u2013now. https://t.co/e03YH65vNy In 1965, my friend @repjohnlewis was beaten and left to die on the Edmund Pettus Bridge as he marched for civil rights. 55 years later, he returned to Selma to remind us all that there\u2019s so much left to fight for.\n\nHis strength and commitment to justice remain an inspiration. https://t.co/ZZ0UpJ4fPP Last week, I got to meet with Janet Taylor Pickett, whose brilliant painting hangs in my Washington, D.C. office.

But we must always be undaunted by the fight. This week, I sent Trump a letter demanding transparency about his plan to address the coronavirus.\n\nThis administration's response to this public health crisis must be based in science and fact, not wishful thinking. We cannot afford to wait any longer for a comprehensive plan. This is heartless. To completely destroy the sacred sites of indigenous communities for a pointless border wall is beyond disgraceful. These communities will never be able to recover what was lost in this destruction. https://t.co/usASOTSIrh On the last day of #BlackHistoryMonth, I'm thinking about the unsung heroes whose shoulders we stand on in the fight for justice and equality.\n\nThese are countless Black Americans whose names we do not know but who fought for what was right, unburdened by what has been. AG Barr is the people's lawyer, not Trump's lawyer. Barr cannot be allowed to permanently damage the independence and integrity of the DOJ.\n\nI\u2019m demanding the DOJ Inspector General investigate political interference at the DOJ on behalf of Trump. https://t.co/V455jAshmv Miss Holidai, this is simply stunning. Keep at it and best of luck! https://t.co/8KuHwcTDam It\u2019s critical that everyone stays informed about the coronavirus and what you can do to protect yourself from it.

Barr clearly thinks of himself as Trump\u2019s lawyer and risks permanently damaging the independence and integrity of the DOJ.\n\nToday I'm leading my colleagues in demanding that the DOJ Inspector General investigate a pattern of political interference by the DOJ on behalf of Trump. Just beautiful. These two have made it clear to young people everywhere that no matter how young you are, your voice matters and you can make a difference. https://t.co/4SKWUvI78K It was so great meeting with Deltas from across California.

Lynchings are horrendous acts of violence that, to this day, are still not considered a federal crime. We are now closer than ever to correcting this historic injustice. https://t.co/MYghiktV1h I'm proud to lead the Senate's effort to criminalize lynchings and bring long overdue justice to the victims of lynching and their families.\n\nIt's critical that these heinous acts of violence are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. We're one step closer to ensuring that. https://t.co/uIzKFU2R6j I'm thrilled the House just passed @RepBobbyRush's  Emmett Till Anti-lynching Act to explicitly criminalize lynching at the federal level. Lynchings were fueled by racism and represent a despicable chapter of our nation\u2019s history.\n\nWe must pass this bill in the Senate. https://t.co/19p7naZYj9 As #BlackHistoryMonth comes to a close, it's important that we continue to recognize the challenges communities of color face in America.\n\nThat means speaking truth that voter suppression is real. White supremacy is real. Racial bias in our health care system is real. These fee increases are a deliberate attempt by the Trump administration to put the American Dream out of reach for immigrants, including hardworking DACA recipients.\n\nMake no mistake, this is what an anti-immigrant agenda looks like. https://t.co/lVEBEyKabc Earlier today, the Senate voted on two anti-choice bills that would let politicians overrule the judgement of patients and health care providers.\n\nThis is yet another attack on women's reproductive rights and we won't stand for it. I voted NO. Attorney General Barr is privately meeting with Senate Republicans today instead of testifying and allowing Democratic Senators to hear from him too.\n\nThis is unacceptable. Barr must testify immediately. We\u2019ve known for years that Russia would continue to interfere in our elections. There\u2019s just no excuse for Senate Republicans leaders to continue blocking comprehensive legislation to secure our elections. https://t.co/nAYkUa4m2Y This is the type of headline we\u2019re used to seeing in dictatorial regimes, not in the United States. https://t.co/DBsyXPTqGm A reminder that John Bolton was willing to testify in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial but Senate Republicans refused to allow it. https://t.co/KTHjCp3ukh We've lost an icon and brilliant mathematician with the passing of Katherine Johnson.\n\nA barrier breaker and inspiration for women of color everywhere, Katherine's legendary work with NASA will forever leave a mark on our history.

These are students who already face enormous barriers to succeed. I\u2019m looking for answers. https://t.co/yrloLPdqRF Stephen Miller\u2019s racist and xenophobic ideologies go against everything we should stand for as a country. He must be removed from the White House immediately. https://t.co/Vu74a58Oqg While he\u2019s in Congress, Attorney General Barr should also come testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Democratic Senators have questions for him too. https://t.co/O8C2ABRcrW Utterly shameful for the GOP to play games with the Census and deliberately mislead Californians with this mailer.\n\nA reminder for everyone: official questionnaires for the 2020 Census will begin arriving on March 12.

And one reason is because Black women are too often not taken seriously when they speak about their pain. https://t.co/fNa9RKkGeC I'm deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Rita Walters, the first Black woman to serve on LA's City Council. For decades, Rita fought for equality and representation on behalf of communities of color. Keeping her family in my thoughts. May we all continue her fight. When ICE shows up at sensitive locations like schools, courthouses, churches, and hospitals, it doesn't make us safer\u2015it incites fear in immigrant communities.

It takes extraordinary courage to run towards danger to keep others safe. Their bravery will never be forgotten. https://t.co/0A9LjUgO1K A victory in the fight against voter suppression. This was a clear effort to suppress Black voters, and make no mistake\u2015this is happening in communities across America. We won't stand for it. https://t.co/WOkmBYgsjg This is outrageous and does not make our communities safer. DHS\u2019 presence in courthouses and other sensitive locations will deter immigrants from reporting crimes.\n\nI stand with our immigrant communities today and every day. This has to stop. https://t.co/zbEqI0SPWR Yesterday, I was proud to host a gathering on Black maternal health with groups fighting to ensure that Black mothers have the support they need.\n\nBlack women are facing a maternal mortality crisis\u2015we must act. https://t.co/d6wpRLXEcg Last week, Trump proposed a budget that is a disaster for hardworking Americans. And now, Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee refuse to even hold a hearing on it.\n\nIt's critical that we have a public discussion about what\u2019s in it. The American people deserve nothing less. 78 years after fear, hate, and division led to the signing of Executive Order 9066, California will formally apologize for its role in the internment of Japanese-Americans. We must never repeat these mistakes. #DayOfRemembrance https://t.co/o1ttcahFP8 I\u2019ll say it again: Judiciary Chairman Graham must hold a hearing immediately on the DOJ\u2019s handling of Roger Stone\u2019s case. The American people deserve to hear for themselves how Trump is politicizing our Justice Department. I just wrapped up hosting a gathering on the Black maternal health crisis. We must speak the uncomfortable truth that too often, Black women are not taken seriously when they speak about their pain.\n\nThis is a public health crisis and it's time we came together to address it. https://t.co/SyVM4NRDqT During #BlackHistoryMonth, it's critical that we remember America's history of slavery and reckon with our past. https://t.co/YcoNf1zDsI The very foundation of our democracy relies on every American exercising their right to vote. For those in California, today is the voter registration deadline to participate in the March 3 primary election. Make sure that you, your friends and loved ones are registered to vote. It's outrageous that Trump administration officials didn't attend last week's Senate Homeland Security meeting on the coronavirus.\n\nCalifornia is on the front line of housing and caring for individuals who may be impacted by this. We need public hearings. https://t.co/zp4iuULd9R Trump's words matter. It's on all of us to condemn this hatred wherever and whenever it occurs. We are so much better than this. https://t.co/nHZPHGMYOm My message to Black women and girls everywhere: never ask for permission to lead. Just lead. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/gHArs7eemG I called for Barr\u2019s resignation last year when he refused to answer whether Trump has asked him to investigate anyone.\n\nI stand by it today\u2014Barr needs to go. https://t.co/LWl7PrNZQD We won\u2019t stand for this blatant attempt to intimidate immigrant communities.\n\nTo those communities in California: I see you, I'm with you, and I will continue to fight for you. You are not alone. https://t.co/qQk2lNYbMx Trump's budget proposes $1 trillion in cuts to health care programs that benefit middle class and working families, including Medicaid and the ACA.\n\nAnd it does this while extending tax cuts for the top 1% and proposing billions for a pointless border wall. This is beyond absurd. William T. Coleman, Jr. broke enormous barriers as a Black lawyer in the civil rights era and the first Black Department of Transportation Secretary. I'm thrilled our bill to rename the Department of Transportation's HQ after him passed the Senate this week. #BlackHistoryMonth https://t.co/Sm6Ph4qIUs Earlier this week I spoke out against a Republican bill that puts the priorities of politicians ahead of the priorities of health care providers. We should not support a bill that traffics misinformation about abortion and seeks to criminalize physicians. https://t.co/iTMZ2mDs5g This is a crucial win for the Native American communities in North Dakota who continue to face barriers to the ballot box. Voter suppression efforts are happening all across America to indigenous communities and communities of color.

We must reckon with the reality of our history. https://t.co/NblxyODqk9 It\u2019s been two years since 17 lives were senselessly taken in Parkland and the Senate still has not passed meaningful gun violence prevention legislation. My heart goes out to the #Parkland community on this difficult day. It\u2019s time for leaders to act. In America today, no college student should be worried they'll go hungry or sleep in their car because they can\u2019t afford housing. This simply should not happen in our country.

We can't afford to let that continue and allow Trump to further escalate tensions with Iran.\n\nI voted YES earlier today to restrain Trump's authority on military conflict with Iran. https://t.co/QKvLqfNtBd Stephen Miller is the hateful force behind the xenophobic policies that have defined the Trump administration. His white supremacist, anti-immigrant ideology has no place in the White House.\n\nI'm proud to lead a resolution in the Senate today calling for his immediate removal. When you lift up women, you lift up children, families, communities and all of society. That's why it's so critical that we finally\u2014in 2020\u2014pass the Equal Rights Amendment. Today, the House passed a resolution to make this happen. The Senate must do its job and pass it. #ERANow RT @HispanicCaucus: Stephen Miller &amp; his white nationalist ideologies have no place in the White House or advising POTUS.\n\n@HispanicCaucus\u2026 Earlier this week, the DOJ overruled its career prosecutors in Roger Stone\u2019s case after President Trump threw a fit on Twitter. This is unprecedented. That\u2019s why I called on Chairman Graham to hold an immediate hearing. https://t.co/6QRQ0TM9bq NEWS: My three bills to protect 1 million acres of land in California have passed the House. I'm thrilled the House has taken decisive action in the face of an administration that continues to chip away at our environmental protections.\n\nIt's time for the Senate to act. My message to Barr: we deserve to know why the DOJ reduced its recommended sentence for Roger Stone after Trump\u2019s tweet. That means you also need to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee. https://t.co/FKZd6kPZH0 Unacceptable that no one from the Trump administration came before the Homeland Security committee today to discuss the coronavirus. We need public hearings so the American people can hear directly from officials leading the response to the crisis. https://t.co/i09ROQB5Is My question last year to Attorney General Barr still gets to the heart of what we\u2019re dealing with today. His refusal to give me a straight answer spoke volumes. The American people deserve to know whether Trump is politicizing our Justice Department. https://t.co/17SXmwqJU6 Trump is applauding his Attorney General for intervening in his former advisor's sentencing. We cannot accept this.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee must call Barr to testify immediately. Doing nothing would completely betray our duty to hold the president accountable. https://t.co/u2jrG19jtz RT @TheBlackCaucus: On this day three decades ago, one man walked out of jail free and determined to end the brutal apartheid system of rac\u2026 Andrew Brasher\u2019s nomination to the 11th Circuit is yet another part of Republicans pushing through judges who will rubber-stamp voter suppression efforts. Earlier today I voted NO on his nomination. He has no business serving a lifetime appointment on the 11th Circuit. This cannot be overlooked: Trump's budget proposes cuts to medical research. This is absurd. My mother was a breast cancer researcher whose work relied on these investments. I know how important this work is to saving lives. There's simply no reason to cut it. This is yet another example of there being two systems of justice in America: one for Trump and his buddies, and another for everyone else. This is a complete mockery of the rule of law.\n\nThe Senate cannot ignore this. We need oversight hearings immediately. https://t.co/yTVGHM8BCT If we want more women to enter and excel in STEM, then we have to address sexual harassment in these fields.

It's on us to redouble our efforts to pass legislation to ensure equal pay. #AAPIEqualPay Some lenders are reportedly charging graduates from HBCUs and Hispanic-serving institutions *more* for their student loans simply for attending these schools. This is an absurd burden on some of our nation\u2019s most promising and deserving students. https://t.co/YOOkzzbMIM Everyone in America should be paying attention to this.

Black history is American history. As we begin #BlackHistoryMonth, let\u2019s recognize that the achievements of Black Americans are woven into every corner of our nation, from music to government and more.

It was dangerous when Nixon told us \u201cwhen the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.\" And it\u2019s just as dangerous now. https://t.co/dqw6U2wSLn Unacceptable. This federal Twitter account for the Bureau of Land Management is blatantly posting an ad for Big Oil. Let that sink in. https://t.co/u22FCuE6uN We know John Bolton is available and willing to testify. The Senate should call him forward.\n\nIf we don\u2019t see a single witness in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, this is a miscarriage of justice. https://t.co/Gzo7zZ2MyI If we have not heard from firsthand witnesses or received all relevant documents, then don\u2019t walk away talking about acquittal. There\u2019s no true acquittal if there hasn\u2019t been a fair trial. https://t.co/3J3iwJsCPz I'm honored to share this solemn responsibility with @RepValDemings as the only two Black women in Trump\u2019s trial.\n\nWe're here because there cannot be two systems of justice: one where the powerful can get away with anything, and another for everyone else. https://t.co/xTtHGy1Sgu Yesterday, Alan Dershowitz made an extraordinarily dangerous argument that parallels Nixon saying \"Well when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.\"\n\nThis is legally indefensible and precisely why I asked this as my first question in Trump's trial: https://t.co/pagGgu5svY My first question yesterday included Trump\u2019s quote, \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it,\u201d because it shows even before he became president, Trump believed he could get away with anything. https://t.co/OP9JMztywR Donald Trump wants nothing more than to say he's been exonerated after his impeachment trial. But let\u2019s be clear: there cannot be a true acquittal without a fair trial. https://t.co/EIc4ZfvZGa RT @SenateDems: From @SenKamalaHarris &amp; @PattyMurray to the House Managers:\n\nDoes the discovery of the Yovanovitch tape suggest that if the\u2026 Right now, the House has a recording of Trump saying about Ambassador Yovanovitch: \u201cGet rid of her! Take her out!\u201d\n\nThis is relevant evidence to Trump's trial. What does it mean if the Senate turns a blind eye to it? My second question today was about just that. https://t.co/9RV9FOQcoD \u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it.\"\n\"Then I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president.\"\n\nIt's clear Trump thinks he's above the law. My first question today was about what's at stake if the Senate doesn't hold Trump accountable. https://t.co/f9dAJMNVYp Like Richard Nixon, Donald Trump thinks he\u2019s above the law. That\u2019s exactly why I asked this question in the trial: https://t.co/LBiCTE6OlY My first question in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial gets to the heart of what\u2019s at stake: if we fail to hold Trump accountable, doesn\u2019t that undermine the integrity of our system of justice? https://t.co/PXbb83EgRI This is a trial. Frankly, any arguments against seeing evidence and firsthand witnesses completely lack merit. https://t.co/5AGspRk53F Joining @CNN now, be sure to tune in! America\u2019s doors shouldn't just be open to higher income immigrants\u2014we should welcome our hard working neighbors no matter how much money is in their pockets. https://t.co/zhBkL7oIsD In courthouses across America today, citizens are walking in being confronted with direct evidence\u2014and they don\u2019t have a choice. Trump shouldn\u2019t either. https://t.co/JChG09OK8D Trump's lawyers have rightly noted that the Senate is the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body.\n\nBut they're not here to engage in deliberation. Instead, they've gone through a laundry list of conspiracy theories and grievances. And they're performing for an audience of one\u2014Trump. Our nation is in a clean water crisis and yet Trump is determined to continue catering to polluters. Clean water is a human right, period. https://t.co/NkVCEuR8ok Yesterday, one of Trump's lawyers made a good point: cross-examination of witnesses brings out the truth.\n\nThat's exactly why the Senate must call John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, Robert Blair, and Michael Duffey as witnesses in Trump's trial. https://t.co/MEBxiwvPX5 John Bolton needs to testify in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial\u2014period. https://t.co/4OJp020FqF RT @SenDuckworth: Spoken like someone who\u2019s never been to war. Just like his boss. https://t.co/6jxr8rwe1V John Bolton has direct evidence of Trump's misconduct. He must testify.\n\nIn courthouses across America every day, people are confronted with direct evidence. Why should the president be treated any differently? He\u2019s not above the law. A few things the White House did last week:\n\n-confirmed plans for an expanded travel ban\n-announced travel restrictions on pregnant women seeking to travel to the U.S.\n-doubled down on deporting DACA recipients\n\nThis is what an anti-immigrant agenda looks like. We have to fight. Betsy DeVos should go back to school and take a history lesson. Comparing our country\u2019s history of slavery to Republicans trying to strip away reproductive rights from women is shameful. She should recant these comments immediately. https://t.co/gq9QiedTLn Last month, I wrote in @nytimes that we need to hear from John Bolton\u2014who shopped his testimony to book publishers instead of speaking with Congress\u2014because he clearly has a lot to say.\n\nIt's undeniable now: Bolton must testify in Trump\u2019s trial. https://t.co/zBnkCNpOP3 Devastating news for Los Angeles and the entire country. Kobe Bryant's impact on basketball and sports was unquestionable. He will remain an inspiration to many for years to come. My heart goes out to his family and loved ones. https://t.co/ue4rxUVwcV Trump's impeachment trial comes down to this: he put his personal and political agenda ahead of the interest of the American people, ahead of the interest of our national security, and ahead of the interest of doing the job of the President of the United States. RT @RepAdamSchiff: All over the world, those living under oppressive regimes look to us. \n\nThey look to us because we have a rule of law. B\u2026 Happy Lunar New Year! Sending warm wishes for a happy and healthy Year of the Rat to everyone celebrating in California and across the country. Today made it clear that President Trump\u2019s defense counsel don\u2019t think they have a case on the merits\u2014so they\u2019re relying on misleading statements and distorted facts. Heading in to hear opening arguments from Trump\u2019s defense counsel\u2014let\u2019s see if they\u2019re gonna stick to facts and the truth. https://t.co/KAveBGzRN9 The seriousness of this moment cannot be lost on anyone. The House managers have done an extraordinary job this week and we must stay focused on our duty as senators to seek the truth.\n\nBecause in America, nobody is above the law\u2014including the President of the United States. .@SecPompeo allowed Ambassador Yovanovitch to be smeared and targeted while she was representing our country abroad. He hardly \u201cdefended every single person\u201d on his team. This is a disgrace.  https://t.co/94Hk6ohWKL Important point made by @RepSylviaGarcia: Trump has submitted 0 documents in response to over 70 requests and 5 subpoenas. He directed his officials not to comply with lawful subpoenas to testify before Congress. This is complete stonewalling. https://t.co/YqjiQO1vCu Trump\u2019s impeachment trial isn\u2019t a television show. It\u2019s not for entertainment. If this process is going to have any legitimacy, it is because it has focused on facts. https://t.co/2d8qFGNABL Always great to catch up with some dear friends and mayors from California. Our mayors are at the forefront of every issue we\u2019re working on in DC\u2014and I know these three are fierce leaders for their communities. https://t.co/v4hqgzc7Lm Trump is tearing apart our nation\u2019s values with his vile, anti-immigrant agenda. We will not stand for it\u2014this has to stop. https://t.co/Lhb0GvnN6g The House managers have done an extraordinary job of showing us the math and laying out the facts. If my Republican colleagues were speaking with any level of sincerity, they would agree. Let's not be distracted by whatever is happening on the sidelines of Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. We need to focus on the facts and seek truth. https://t.co/2mHimPn5eb Let's be clear about something. On Tuesday, every single Republican senator voted to block access to firsthand witnesses and relevant documents.\n\nAnd now they have to gall to say that so far in the trial, they haven't learned anything new.\n\nThey can\u2019t have it both ways. The issue before us: Trump tried to solicit foreign interference in our election, got caught, and is trying to cover it up. https://t.co/ItaEuWb0T0 A disgraceful comment from the commander in chief. Downplaying the invisible wounds of war inflicted on our service members is a slap in their face. If Trump can\u2019t see that, then how can he care for them? https://t.co/NECM7f8EdY Today, the House managers laid out the case against Trump the same way I would have\u2014by showing the math. And the math shows Trump tried to solicit foreign interference in our elections, got caught, and is trying to cover it up. https://t.co/uG1mlAtWE5 It's simple:\n\n-Zelensky told Trump he needed military aid\n-Then Trump said, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor, though.\u201d\n-That same day, Michael Duffey sent an email directing military aid to be withheld\n\nNow the White House is withholding Duffey's emails. This is a cover-up. Heading into day 2 of Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, here\u2019s a quick update. https://t.co/y3iWeV2ARW 47 years ago today, the Supreme Court recognized a woman\u2019s right to choose in Roe v. Wade. To this day, Republicans are determined to turn back the clock to when women were dying from unsafe abortions. But we won\u2019t let them\u2014we must keep up the fight for reproductive justice. There is no denying that voter suppression is real in America. There are Republican efforts across the country to deny people of color their fundamental right to vote. This threatens the very heart of our democracy and we have to fight. https://t.co/sFyEKhyn3M Final thought tonight: every single Republican senator voted to block every single amendment for relevant evidence and firsthand witnesses. Let that sink in.\n\nThe American people deserve better than this. We need a fair trial. Not a cover-up. Republicans shot down amendments that would allow senators to access relevant evidence withheld by the White House, State Department, and OMB.\n\nWe're witnessing an effort to obstruct senators' ability to actually know what happened\u2014this is shameful. https://t.co/oVezqVq7hy On break right now and let me just say this: I fully support Senator Schumer\u2019s amendment to ensure we see all relevant documents withheld by the White House. Documents don\u2019t lie.\n\nIf Republicans block this, then it\u2019s not a fair trial. Period. Quick update on Trump\u2019s impeachment trial: I will vote against any resolution that circumvents a fair trial and does not pursue justice. https://t.co/HvYier9FVk We need to hear from Mick Mulvaney. We need to hear from John Bolton. And we need to hear from those who helped Trump break the law by withholding military aid to Ukraine: Michael Duffey and Robert Blair. Every one of them must testify in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. The rules for the trial that McConnell proposed last night are unacceptable. It\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t want a fair trial\u2014he wants a cover-up. It\u2019s clear McConnell and Trump want to ignore sworn evidence. And they don\u2019t want firsthand witnesses to Trump\u2019s misconduct.\n\nBut the American people want a fair trial and they will hold every senator accountable for their votes tomorrow. https://t.co/qKU96Le6zm Last week, a non-partisan federal report confirmed that Trump broke the law by withholding military aid to Ukraine.\n\nIt\u2019s more important now than ever that we hear firsthand from those who helped Trump break the law\u2014including Michael Duffey and Robert Blair. Thinking of these words today by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. - \u201cThe time is always right to do what is right.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s on all of us to own the words that Dr. King spoke and everything he stood for, fought for, and died for. #MLKDay Good\u2014we shouldn\u2019t be advancing any judicial nominees while the person who nominates them is on trial. https://t.co/TYHDfoadWV I am fully prepared to follow the facts and the evidence where they lead. That means we need all documents and first-hand witnesses. https://t.co/PN7NBusd4Y It\u2019s important to remember that every issue is a woman\u2019s issue. The economy, our national security, immigration, the environment and more\u2014women must not be relegated to any single issue. To everyone across California attending Women\u2019s Marches today: march with joy, march with conviction, and know that I stand with you today and every day. #WomensMarch2020 Indigenous women and girls are missing and murdered at an alarming rate.

Period. https://t.co/LYwE3hQawD Downright irresponsible for @SecPompeo to continue hiding in the face of evidence of our diplomats being smeared and targeted while representing our country abroad.\n\nOur diplomats must be protected &amp; we need to know the truth about Pompeo\u2019s involvement in Trump\u2019s Ukraine scheme. https://t.co/8762ZKbClF I stand with the Sikh community in Orangevale against this hateful display of white supremacy. This has no place in America and it\u2019s on every one of us to call out and condemn this hate wherever it occurs. https://t.co/HA4icR8Y0P From the suffragettes to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., our nation has been shaped by those who have organized, fought, and marched for justice. But there is still more work to be done. https://t.co/2sdQPVt0wz History will judge whether the Senate rose to the solemn occasion of the impeachment trial of President Trump.\n\nI'm fully prepared to uphold my duty to protect the Constitution, follow the facts where they lead, and hold this president accountable. I hope my colleagues are too. The Senate is receiving the articles of impeachment against President Trump today. We should not advance any more judicial nominees while we take on this solemn responsibility of the president\u2019s trial for high crimes and misdemeanors. Wishing my Sorors of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc a happy 112th Founders\u2019 Day! Honored to join AKA members of Congress as we recognized our beloved sisterhood under the Rosa Parks statue in the U.S. Capitol. https://t.co/PBHREYczZc Outrageous. Trump's political allies insulted, tracked, and plotted against a dedicated public servant representing our country abroad.\n\n@SecPompeo, it's your job to protect diplomats. What did you know, when did you know, and what did you do to stop it? We need answers\u2014now. https://t.co/5XPcTcwEh8 Drawing my inspiration today from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on what would have been his 91st birthday. Dr. King had a deep conviction that our country could live up to the ideals of freedom and justice for all. We must carry on his fight today and every day. #MLK91 The Senate will be judged by whether we rose to the solemn occasion of the impeachment trial of President Trump. And we cannot be passive in this moment\u2014we must show that no one is above the law. https://t.co/ZsYa3dYHQE RT @RepValDemings: Dear all of America\u2019s criminals: please continue to take notes on your crimes. https://t.co/OCAdfJt8VH This is a scary situation.

My office will continue to monitor the situation and get answers. https://t.co/5G1Lm1Ckye Too often, when a Black woman walks into a doctor\u2019s office or a hospital expressing pain or discomfort, she is not taken seriously.

Congratulations on the Oscar nomination, @MatthewACherry! #HairLove https://t.co/hGfLrmuPH9 Our trade policies should lift up workers and grow the economy, but must also protect our environment and our future. By not confronting climate change, the USMCA fails to meet the crises of the moment.\n\nWe can do better, and that's why today I voted NO on the USMCA in committee. An absolutely devastating loss for Los Angeles County. My sincerest condolences to Detective Amber Leist\u2019s family and loved ones. Her service and sacrifice will never be forgotten. https://t.co/AD4zDvXDfV The American people should demand their senators seek the truth, and not cover up the facts. That means we need to hear from Mick Mulvaney, John Bolton, and anyone with firsthand knowledge of the president\u2019s misconduct. https://t.co/boAzJ05clA Sara Saadat was headed back to San Diego, where she studied clinical psychology, before this senseless tragedy took her life and that of her sister and mother.

It\u2019s up to the Senate to ensure Trump is held accountable for his actions\u2014no one is above the law. https://t.co/1IWrJS6cCa @deitramatthews This warms my heart\u2014thanks for watching! I'm headed to the Senate floor to talk about the upcoming impeachment trial of President Trump. We have a duty to ensure the integrity of the American system of justice and ensure that nobody\u2014including the president\u2014is above the law. Watch live here. https://t.co/PoVP4xp35g This is precisely why I introduced the Clean School Bus Act. 25 million children\u2014particularly children of color\u2014breathe polluted air every day due to old diesel school buses.\n\nMy bill will change that by electrifying our nation\u2019s school bus fleet. https://t.co/0fwk3ttX54 In Trump's impeachment trial, we must ensure a fair process that truly reflects our values. The American people want to know that their senators are pursuing truth and justice. We've fought Trump's xenophobic travel bans before, and we will fight them again. Our country's values are at stake and we must make our voices heard. https://t.co/xaIEOXfoo5 We need hand-marked paper ballots in all federal elections\u2014now.

I share their concern.\n\nBut it should also infuriate them that Trump has obstructed Congress' oversight efforts and blocked funds we directed for military aid. I\u2019m ready. https://t.co/qnKaC6jt2r Every member of Congress should be concerned about the potential consequences of conflict with Iran and Trump's lack of a coherent strategy. We cannot let Trump unilaterally start a new war.\n\nThat's why yesterday my colleagues and I introduced the No War Against Iran Act. I\u2019m rooting for you, Devin\u2014best of luck on the UCLA dance team! https://t.co/ai93wcAMPf I applaud @GavinNewsom for taking bold steps to bring down the cost of prescription drugs for Californians. It\u2019s time for Congress to act and lower drug prices for people across the nation. https://t.co/G1fKIcWimJ .@SpeakerPelosi is right. This isn\u2019t 1999. During Clinton's impeachment:\n\n-that President fully cooperated with Congress\n-first-hand witnesses from the administration gave sworn testimony\n\nTrump is blocking witnesses and documents\u2014and McConnell vows to be in 'total coordination.' https://t.co/uorTJOhQ36 Pharmaceutical companies continue to prioritize profits over people by hiking up the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nAmericans are tired of this. No patient should have to delay or skip their drugs because of prices. https://t.co/b585LQxtOv This will have devastating consequences, particularly for communities of color. It's wrong and yet another example of Trump prioritizing lining the pockets of Big Oil at the expense of hardworking people and our environment. https://t.co/4S21V26wAK Congratulations to my dear friend @LondonBreed on being sworn in once again as the Mayor of San Francisco.

This information should be declassified immediately, not hidden from the American people.\n\nThe public deserves transparency.

My heart goes out to them and their families who are eagerly waiting their return home. https://t.co/lTpkEA0JVq As a former prosecutor, I know that a trial is about getting to the truth. That means we need to hear from witnesses with direct knowledge of Trump's misconduct\u2014including Bolton.\n\nIf Republicans vote to prevent any witness testimony, then it's clear they\u2019re part of the cover-up.

When the Senate convenes to conduct the impeachment trial of President Trump, I will swear an oath to uphold the Constitution, review evidence, and follow the facts wherever they lead. I\u2019ll be fighting for justice, and each of my colleagues should too. May every single day of 2020 be filled with love and joy as we continue our fight for justice and equality. Wishing you and your loved ones a happy and healthy new year! This administration is putting the American Dream out of reach for many by targeting DACA recipients, asylum seekers, and other immigrants with exorbitant fees. This is wrong\u2014immigrants make our nation stronger.\n\nMy colleagues and I are fighting back. Laws are in place to protect whistleblowers because getting to the truth is critical to the pursuit of justice.\n\nBy potentially revealing a whistleblower\u2019s identity, Trump is intimidating witnesses and has betrayed the public\u2019s trust. https://t.co/VdQ1MkrgAx Trump is gutting the asylum process in America\u2014something that is at the core of who we are as a country. Turning our backs on those lawfully seeking asylum and forcing them to \u2018Remain in Mexico\u2019 is cruel, dangerous, and un-American. This has to stop. https://t.co/omoiaD0Y77 Deeply saddened to hear of the attack in Monsey and keeping those injured in my thoughts. This was yet another vile act of anti-Semitism and it has no place in America. We must speak out and condemn this hatred whenever and wherever we see it. This is wrong. We know that purging voter registrations disproportionately affects people of color. This is voter suppression in plain sight. We have to fight this with everything we\u2019ve got. https://t.co/bWtwekBpAv Americans want law enforcement to protect and respect them, yet too many people of color continue to be targeted. Ignoring this reality is completely irresponsible. We need stronger police oversight to prevent abuses, and that must include bias training. https://t.co/KXAgiG3O5L It\u2019s clear that Mitch McConnell doesn\u2019t want a Senate trial-he wants a Senate cover up. But he cannot undermine this process on his own.\n\nEvery one of my Senate colleagues has an obligation to pursue the truth, regardless of politics. https://t.co/DoRzhtM0XA We must speak truth that there is a homelessness crisis in America, including in CA. This is an emergency that must be addressed with bold action. Congress must pass my bill with @RepMaxineWaters to invest $13 billion to eradicate chronic homelessness. https://t.co/mXVdPk3iTJ A very happy #Kwanzaa to all who are celebrating in California and across the country! May your life be filled with community and joy. This Christmas, I\u2019m thinking about all of our brave service members and their families in California and across the country. You make our nation proud and we are grateful for your sacrifices. Merry Christmas! Wishing everyone who celebrates a day filled with family, friends, and good cheer. Our DREAMers shouldn\u2019t live in fear of being torn from their communities, let alone during the holidays.\n\nTo our DREAMer community: I see you, and I will fight for your right to stay in the only country you know as home. https://t.co/ljMBVSrG1H Natalia was attacked for no other reason than the color of her skin. Her attacker must be held accountable for this. https://t.co/mwUZpKjrA1 Here\u2019s something that didn\u2019t change this decade: the federal minimum wage. Since 2009, the federal minimum wage has been $7.25 an hour. That\u2019s not nearly enough.\n \nThe Senate must pass the Raise the Wage Act\u2014we need a $15 federal minimum wage. This is horrifying. Trump is turning his back on those lawfully seeking asylum in America and these are the consequences. The Trump administration must be held accountable for the inhumane \u2018remain in Mexico\u2019 policy. This must end. https://t.co/Xl7O0o00Rm Chag Sameach to all those celebrating Hanukkah! May your holiday be filled with light, love and laughter. Under Stephen Miller's plan, immigrant families would be forced to choose between taking over care of their children in US custody or endangering themselves.\n\nThis isn't national security\u2014it\u2019s white supremacy. Miller must be removed from the White House immediately. https://t.co/FGW5FsuFBj Transgender people\u2014and in particular, Black trans women\u2014are facing an epidemic of violence. We must recommit ourselves to speaking this truth and fighting anti-trans violence. My heart goes out to Yahira's family and loved ones. https://t.co/HS7dG8PqeY Reminder that in July, Senate Republicans sent a letter to Secretary Mnuchin demanding *even more tax cuts* for the wealthiest among us. https://t.co/DI5vg39Zh0 Americans living in federally assisted housing do not deserve fewer privacy protections. I joined a letter with @RonWyden demanding answers on HUD's use of facial recognition technology in federally assisted housing. https://t.co/Ptybp5VlsX It\u2019s clear that John Bolton has a lot to share about Trump\u2019s scheme to extort Ukraine. The American people deserve to know the truth\u2014Congress should hear from Bolton during Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. https://t.co/86b3xwndaC Aretha\u2019s songs were the soundtrack of my childhood. I was honored to lead an effort in Congress to recognize her legacy with a Congressional Gold Medal. And I\u2019m thrilled she\u2019ll be remembered on the big screen\u2014can\u2019t wait to see. https://t.co/m2FXKQj96t Suicide rates among children of color have increased at an alarming rate. I thank @RepBonnie and @TheBlackCaucus for bringing attention to this issue and putting forth legislation that will save lives. https://t.co/ippAYU5sR0 It\u2019s wrong for any foreign government to tell Congress what members are allowed in meetings on Capitol Hill. I stand with @RepJayapal, and I'm glad her colleagues in the House did too. https://t.co/PpbDoB0zKB The 5th Circuit has put the ACA one step closer to being overturned. 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions are closer to losing their protections because Trump and Republicans care more about scoring a political win.\n\nBut this isn't the end\u2014we must keep fighting. https://t.co/h0zQUhWLld If we want to ensure more women enter and excel in STEM careers, then we need to fundamentally change the workplace climate in these fields. My bill to combat sexual harassment in STEM passed the House months ago\u2014the Senate must do its job &amp; pass my bill. https://t.co/ezv4aBpdVh McConnell seems more interested in covering up Trump's misconduct than pursuing truth and fairness.\n\nThat's why it's incumbent on my colleagues to show the country there are not two sets of rules\u2014one for Trump and another for everybody else. Read my op-ed. https://t.co/YBEQqJleCD I thank the House for conducting an investigation that lived up to our founders\u2019 expectations.\n\nIt will soon fall on the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty. I will pursue truth, fairness, and justice. I urge each of my colleagues to do the same. In America, nobody is above the law. And nobody, especially a president, should escape accountability.\n\nToday, Donald J. Trump goes down as only the third president in American history to be impeached. It's absurd PG&amp;E execs were awarded millions in bonuses for 'safety goals' while they put profits over safety. Lives were lost because of their negligence.\n\nThis is why I introduced a bill to ensure utility execs don't get bonuses during bankruptcy. https://t.co/LBPIiydNqH Let\u2019s be clear: McConnell doesn\u2019t want a Senate trial. He wants a Senate cover up.\n\nEvery senator has a duty to use their voice and vote for a fair trial rooted in the pursuit of truth. I\u2019ll be fighting for justice\u2014my colleagues should too. Read my op-ed. https://t.co/YBEQqJleCD It is important to remember that today's historic vote in the House is born out of patriotism and love of country. It is about having the courage to speak truth and pursue justice. I can only imagine how thrilled Harvey Milk would be to witness the construction of this ship. His legacy of fighting for civil rights will live on for generations. We must continue to live by his example. https://t.co/D5rT2LoL66 Hundreds of thousands of voters are set to be purged from voter rolls in Wisconsin and Georgia. This is a shameful attempt at voter suppression by GOP lawmakers to rig the system in their favor. We have to fight this. https://t.co/PvaMx16dIw 1.5 million Armenians were killed between 1915 and 1923 during the Armenian Genocide. There is no denying this. I stand with our Armenian community in commemorate those lost and acknowledging this horrific chapter in our history. https://t.co/hd7L126Dlg We cannot wait any longer to address the homelessness crisis in America. In October, I introduced a bill with @RepMaxineWaters to invest $13 billion to eradicate chronic homelessness across the country. Congress must pass it immediately. https://t.co/0IWP3MlXAL A bittersweet moment for the community at Newtown. Congratulations to the Newtown football team on this special win. https://t.co/CyMHGSKNOa Several records were broken this decade showing the dire reality of the climate crisis\u2014but there is hope.\n \nThis decade also saw the largest climate strike in history and unprecedented mobilization by young people. It's time for leaders to step up and act. https://t.co/gMYSoohUr7 I agree, @LindseyGrahamSC. Giuliani needs to come before the Senate Judiciary Committee immediately and testify under oath about his involvement in Trump's Ukraine scheme. We can\u2019t afford to wait any longer. https://t.co/nuDnmh50xP Love is love. https://t.co/wMbYFqCLIy Betsy DeVos's own staff recommended full debt relief for these defrauded students. She didn't have to do this.\n\nAs California's AG, I sued for-profit colleges for intentionally misleading students. It's clear DeVos cares more about protecting these companies than students. https://t.co/OcUTIOAlG1 Throughout his years in the White House, Stephen Miller\u2019s racist and xenophobic policies have been driven by white supremacy. He is unfit to serve in any capacity in the White House.\n\nLast week, I led 26 senators in demanding his immediate removal from the White House. Open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act ends TODAY for a majority of the country. Some states have extended deadlines (Californians, ours is January 31) so be sure to check. Remember that your health affects every aspect of your life\u2014get covered at https://t.co/xpFV3AWDwB. A family presented themselves at our border to lawfully claim asylum. The Trump administration turned its back on them, and a father of two is now dead.\n \nMake no mistake: this was preventable. My heart goes out to his family. https://t.co/rxWA6xtz3n Reminder that earlier this week, the DOJ IG issued a balanced and thorough report that found no evidence that political bias played a role in the launching of the Russia investigation into the Trump campaign. Rudy Giuliani should be meeting with a defense attorney, not the President of the United States. https://t.co/6okPRXrEhE Seven years ago, our entire country mourned the unspeakable acts of violence against the children and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary. Not enough has been done to prevent these tragedies from happening again. It\u2019s shameful. We must continue fighting for the safety of our kids. This morning, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold the president accountable for his actions. The facts are clear: Trump has betrayed the trust of the American people in order to pursue his own political agenda. He must be impeached. We cannot forget that Republicans continue to stack our courts with ideologues\u2014for lifetime positions. This will impact our country for generations. https://t.co/jHMtF1wyOk Let me say it again: I refuse to let @ICEgov get away with not turning over footage of Roxsana Hern\u00e1ndez, a 33-year-old transgender Latinx woman who died in U.S. custody.\n\nWe need a special counsel to investigate this immediately. https://t.co/4zTblYKrCD It\u2019s clear the Trump administration doesn\u2019t care about clean air\u2014and more Americans will die prematurely because of it. https://t.co/akJ3UpILWj Truer words could not have been spoken. @RepValDemings is the embodiment of the American dream and I'm grateful to work alongside her in Congress. https://t.co/cMn8YLZQ9E Every single person in this photo is an example of a dedicated public servant who has worked tirelessly to preserve all that we hold dear about our country. I thank them for their service. https://t.co/MwxgtZjNPr The NYT broke that Rudy Giuliani offered to help fix criminal cases against Ukrainian tycoons in exchange for political dirt digging\u2014a scheme that led to a meeting with Barr.\n\nDOJ Inspector General Horowitz said this would be \"very concerning.\"\n\nThat\u2019s an understatement. https://t.co/AZtjjLuXWl We know different justice systems exist for different people. Many of us have seen it. @RepHankJohnson experienced it first-hand as a child in the Jim Crow era.\n\nWe cannot continue perpetuating two justice systems. Trump must be held accountable. No one is above the law. https://t.co/hL12ZtPjYa The fight for #NetNeutrality is a fight for the future of our economy, free speech, and consumer protection. That's why I'm a proud cosponsor of the Save the Internet Act. It's time for the Senate to do its job and pass this bill. Lawrence VanDyke once wrote that all gun safety laws are \"misdirected\" and even sought the endorsement of the NRA in a 2014 campaign.\n\nVanDyke has no business serving a lifetime appointment to the 9th Circuit. Earlier today, I voted NO on his nomination. Several of my Republican colleagues today expressed concern about the politicization of the DOJ. I share their concern.\n\nThey should join my call for an investigation into whether Attorney General Barr is inappropriately running the DOJ to benefit Trump politically. I'm heading into the Judiciary Committee hearing right now to question the DOJ Inspector General. We need to get to the bottom of political interference in Barr's Justice Department. We know of at least 3 immigrant children who died after being in U.S. custody with the flu. Why put more at risk? It makes no sense to deny flu vaccines to immigrant children in U.S. custody. https://t.co/4bNTIZ6neM For years, Stephen Miller has worked to uphold white supremacist ideology in the White House. He's helped craft some of Trump's most cruel &amp; xenophobic policies, including separating immigrant families.\n\nHe must be removed from the White House immediately.\nhttps://t.co/Atf6rw7X8Z Isabel and other immigrants fighting serious illnesses deserve better than Trump's inhumane threat to deport them. I\u2019m thrilled Isabel will be able to continue living in the US, but she never should have faced deportation in the first place. https://t.co/2RbBXdoAC2 I\u2019m a proud graduate of an #HBCU and know firsthand the value of attending these institutions.\n\nThrilled that Congress finally passed a bill to permanently fund HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions for the next wave of leaders. Trump must sign this bill without delay. Trump betrayed his oath of office by putting his own personal political interests over our national interest.\n\n@RepAdamSchiff is right\u2014doing nothing would mean being complicit in Trump's betrayal. We have no choice but to impeach. https://t.co/U4TA3raH9l On this #HumanRightsDay, let's remember to uplift the voices of those who continue to face barriers to equality, including women, individuals with disabilities, indigenous people, immigrants, and our LGBTQ+ community. In October, astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir completed the first ever all-female spacewalk\u2014a historic moment that will inspire young girls everywhere for generations. I'm proud to join my colleagues in a resolution recognizing these extraordinary women. Yesterday, SCOTUS gave the green light for Kentucky to continue with an all-out assault on women\u2019s reproductive rights. This is outrageous. Women have a right to make their own decisions about their bodies, full stop. We must fight this. https://t.co/sgg6eL4Pbw This is beautiful! Congratulations, ladies. https://t.co/maXwXeMImy Something we're not talking about enough: communities across America have dangerous PFAS chemicals contaminating their water. Congress has the opportunity to hold polluters accountable and regulate these toxic chemicals. It\u2019s time we take action to secure clean water for all. The DOJ IG report makes one thing absolutely clear: the FBI was right to open an investigation into the Trump campaign\u2014which led to 37 criminal indictments.\n\nRepublicans can no longer claim the investigation was launched because of political bias. It\u2019s time to put this to rest. https://t.co/N4Mk3tvb9y From the Muslim ban to family separations, Stephen Miller has worked to advance white supremacist, anti-immigrant ideologies. This has no place in our country, let alone the White House.\n\nToday I'm leading 26 senators in demanding Miller's immediate removal from the White House. It's simple: Trump can't whine about not receiving due process in the House and then refuse to participate in public proceedings.\n\nNo president has done this before.\n\nI'll say it again: justice will be served whether Trump participates or not. \nhttps://t.co/MLi9JemXz8 Dr. Fiona Hill said it herself: there is no evidence to back this up. Republicans in Congress are spreading Russian propaganda, and it\u2019s exactly what Putin wants. It is downright shameful. https://t.co/h6XflfYl9b Border Patrol agents left a child to die in a cell. No human being deserves this.\n\nThe results of the investigations into Carlos's death need to be published immediately. Any Border Patrol agents who were complicit in his death must be held accountable. https://t.co/h0jIOvZVPH Farmers in the Midwest are facing increasing flooding. Families have been devastated by hurricanes in the South and East. Firefighters in the West are battling wildfires almost year-round.\n\nClimate change is here\u2014and it will get worse if we don't act. https://t.co/OcqJDZdqux The gall of the White House to say this immediately after taking action to kick 700,000 Americans off of food assistance. https://t.co/pFfwO3FZoY Trump arbitrarily ended a policy that effectively prohibited detaining pregnant women in immigrant detention facilities. This is abhorrent. Detaining pregnant women doesn\u2019t make our country safer\u2014it\u2019s cruel and immoral. https://t.co/Qi1qWp49AA On the 78th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, we remember the more than 2,400 who perished that fateful day and the sacrifice of those who answered the call to serve because of it. Access to the ballot box has been under attack for voters of color ever since the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013. It's on Congress to restore it.\n\nEarlier today, the #VRAA passed the House\u2014and now it's in the Senate's hands. Let's get it done. https://t.co/cERhZDyYcD Trump has repeatedly complained about due process in the House. Now he\u2019s refusing to participate in public proceedings\u2014again.\n\nIt\u2019s clear Trump thinks he's above the law and can get away with anything.\n\nBut enough whining. Justice will be served whether Trump participates or not. https://t.co/2uY9MMGPzw I'm thrilled HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions are one step closer to receiving this critical support, but we cannot overlook the fact that Republican leaders should never have delayed this funding in the first place. https://t.co/FmcM6BE1OM This is disgraceful. We're talking about cutting almost 700,000 Americans from food assistance. It's cruel, it's unnecessary, and it helps no one. We will fight this. https://t.co/lWVyFAQceW Law enforcement's commitment to protect and serve doesn't come with conditions. These comments by Attorney General Barr are disturbing and clearly meant to intimidate communities of color.\n\nThis is a failure of leadership by the Justice Department. https://t.co/6A8umV8F4l A beautiful reminder for little girls everywhere to love their crown. https://t.co/R4dJfvzakX Hopeful.\nHonorable.\nSelf-determined.\n\nThat\u2019s who Nipsey Hussle was. His legacy will live on in Los Angeles and across the world for years to come. https://t.co/E8rPqpgBoL Too many college students across America are going to class hungry. Some will sleep in their car tonight because they can\u2019t afford housing. This shouldn\u2019t happen in America. That's why I introduced a bill to help college students afford basic needs. https://t.co/URaZFVNRUi Trump is a lawless president who has betrayed our country and broken his oath of office. I agree with @SpeakerPelosi\u2014our democracy is at stake and Trump must be impeached. No one is above the law. https://t.co/VRvcGCjyiB The evidence in the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s report makes it clear: Trump\u2019s scheme to pressure Ukraine was an abuse of power for his own political gain. This is precisely why our founders put impeachment powers into our Constitution. Putin may not like it, but the facts are clear: Russia\u2014not Ukraine\u2014interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nRussia targeted the very heart of our democracy and they\u2019re still trying. It\u2019s unacceptable for Republicans in Congress to distort the truth. https://t.co/Fkv5bA2h1Q These shoes, diaries, medications and so much more show us the humanity of immigrants who travel for miles in hope of a better life. We must ensure that the United States remains a place where immigrants are welcomed. https://t.co/C1x3MqhWJp Spread the word: open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act is happening right now through December 15. Note that some states have extended deadlines (Californians, ours is January 15). Your health affects every aspect of your life\u2014get covered today at https://t.co/xpFV3AWDwB. I'll say it again: Russia can't hack a piece of paper. That's why I cosponsored a bill to mandate hand-marked paper ballots in all federal elections.\n\nThere's simply no reason to delay passing this bill. @senatemajldr, what's it going to take? https://t.co/OWWKxnPCur Nebane Abienwi died in ICE custody after fleeing violence in Cameroon. His family is still waiting for answers about the circumstances of his death.\n\nMore than 24 immigrants have died in ICE custody under the Trump administration. This has to stop. https://t.co/ynf0r9dQZH Make no mistake that as Trump does everything he can to ignore the climate crisis, we will continue to fight. Grateful for @SpeakerPelosi's leadership to ensure the world knows the United States is still committed to the Paris Agreement. #WeAreStillIn https://t.co/WhHCWVJuEQ Today, SCOTUS is hearing oral arguments in one of the biggest gun safety cases in nearly a decade. Lives are at stake.\n\nThat's why I've requested that the Court release audio today\u2014the American people deserve to hear these arguments for themselves without delay. #GunLawsSaveLives Since California banned conversion therapy for minors in 2012, more than a dozen states have followed suit. I\u2019m thrilled Utah is on track to do the same. Conversion therapy is a fraudulent and harmful practice and it must be banned nationwide for all. https://t.co/Znhlj8kRdt For those of us who witnessed the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the memories of those lost linger in our hearts. We must reaffirm our commitment stopping the spread of HIV.\n\nThat's why PrEP is so important. I introduced a bill to improve access to and coverage of PrEP. #WorldAIDSDay The vast majority of Americans who rely on SNAP are children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities. We should be doing everything we can to ensure they have access to food, not pulling out the rug from under millions of them. https://t.co/87WjnFtFs8 On this day in 1955, Rosa Parks decided enough was enough\u2014and refused to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery, AL. The courage she embodied during the Civil Rights movement continues to inspire me today. We must honor her legacy by continuing to fight for justice and equality. From the San Joaquin Valley to Flint, Americans are living everyday without clean water-particularly in communities of color.\n\nThis is a crisis &amp; we must ensure clean water for all. I introduced the Water Justice Act to invest $250 billion to do just that. https://t.co/BKx507mDvL Shirley Chisholm was born on this day in 1924. As the first Black woman elected to Congress, she demonstrated the guts, grit, and grace every leader should have.\n\nI was proud to introduce a bill to honor Shirley Chisholm\u2019s legacy by placing a statue of her in the U.S. Capitol. Small businesses are the backbone of our country\u2019s economy, with over 4 million in California alone. Take some time today to #ShopSmall and remember the critical role small businesses play in helping our communities thrive. DHS created a fake university &amp; accepted immigrants on student visas. When it was shut down, DHS tried deporting some of these students because they weren\u2019t enrolled in school.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just cruel, it\u2019s a waste of taxpayer dollars. Officials must be held accountable for this. https://t.co/7A5m3L7LV7 The Trump administration ripped thousands of children away from their parents and knew they would have trouble reunifying them.\n\nThey estimated 26K children could be affected, and they did it anyway.\n\nThis is human rights abuse, full stop. https://t.co/SnJCoXpBHR In some communities, Native American women are murdered at a rate of 10x the national average. Countless Native women and girls have been murdered or are missing. This issue urgently needs our attention.\n\nI cosponsored Savanna's Act to help combat this crisis. #MMIWG There is no Thanksgiving without our hardworking farm workers in California and across the country. Remember to thank them today and every day. https://t.co/8pHUEMsyoT This Thanksgiving, I'm especially grateful to represent the almost 40 million Californians who remind me of what makes America great. From Eureka to San Diego, our state's diverse people, places and opinions embody the American spirit.\n\nWhat are you grateful for this year? Wounded Knee was a massacre of hundreds of defenseless Native men, women, and children at the hands of U.S. soldiers. We must take steps to address this horrific injustice. Today, I am proud to join my colleagues on a bill to revoke Medals of Honor awarded for Wounded Knee. If you are in a burn area in California, please stay alert this Thanksgiving week and be ready to evacuate, if needed. Heavy rains carry the risk of mudslides, flooding, or dangerous debris flows. https://t.co/4KlzG0nRzr A reminder from last week\u2019s impeachment testimony by Dr. Fiona Hill: Republicans in Congress are spewing Russian propaganda by falsely suggesting that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. This is precisely what Russia wants and it has to stop. We need bold action to address our housing and homelessness crisis. Last week, I introduced a bill to invest more than $100 billion in affordable housing. Every American deserves access to a safe and affordable home, and this is one step to ensuring that. https://t.co/dnATfDESxR This administration has relentlessly attacked the rights, safety, and dignity of our LGBTQ+ community. We must protect the most marginalized members of our communities, and that includes Black trans women who are facing violence at an alarming rate. https://t.co/phHZM7mSSE RT @RepEscobar: There\u2019s no official government definition for \u201csanctuary city.\u201d  It\u2019s become a term used by lazy politicians to fuel xenoph\u2026 Last week, my bill to legalize marijuana passed through House committee with bipartisan support.\n\nI\u2019ll say it again: we can't legalize marijuana without addressing the injustices to people of color caused by the War on Drugs. My bill would do just that. There\u2019s simply no room to misrepresent the fact that Russia\u2014not Ukraine\u2014interfered in the 2016 election. Every single one of my Republican colleagues in Congress who have said so should follow suit and in the words of Dr. Fiona Hill, stop spreading Russian propaganda. https://t.co/Vr5uLAwo2Y Californians: some evacuation orders have been lifted for the #CaveFire. This is welcome news for countless of residents who want nothing more than to be home for Thanksgiving. Keeping those affected in my thoughts and grateful for the tireless work of our firefighters. https://t.co/s4dn1XHLxR America's oldest civil rights law is at risk of being narrowed and limited by the Supreme Court. This is wrong and we have to speak up and make our voices heard.\n\nThat's why I led my colleagues in a resolution affirming the importance of the law. https://t.co/iTMcRqOl57 RT @RedCrossCCR: #CaveFire: An evacuation shelter is being opened at the Goleta Valley Community Center (5679 Hollister Ave in Goleta) for\u2026 RT @CAL_FIRE: #CaveFire near Highway 154 in Santa Barbara County is 3,800 acres. \nUnified Command: @LosPadresNF @SBCFireInfo @CALFIRE_SLO\u2026 This shouldn\u2019t happen. Every American has the right to clean water, period. That\u2019s why I introduced the Water Justice Act to invest $250 billion to address our nation\u2019s water crisis. https://t.co/TOeDLqCB8B Former WH Counsel Don McGahn must comply with this court order by testifying before Congress immediately.\n\nAnd let's be clear: he shouldn't delay testifying by asking Gorsuch and Kavanaugh\u2014the very justices he hand-picked for SCOTUS\u2014to bail him out.\n\nNo one is above the law. https://t.co/KasC1o4PrQ There's an epidemic of violence against Native American women in our country and we\u2019re not doing nearly enough to stop it. One thing Congress can do: pass the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. Proud to cosponsor this bill\u2014the Senate must pass it immediately. My LIFT Act would put up to $500 a month back in the pockets of working families. For many, this could be the difference between getting through the end of the month or falling behind.\n\nWe need an economy that works for working people. Congress must pass my bill. A new study estimates that *3.2 million more people* lived in poverty in 2018 than originally reported. It\u2019s becoming more expensive to be poor as the price of housing &amp; other necessities continue to rise.\n\nMy LIFT Act would help Americans make ends meet. https://t.co/ZZ6GdjiEcx As many Americans gather this week for Thanksgiving, we have to keep in mind those who simply cannot. That includes Americans experiencing homelessness, family members in different countries, service members away from their loved ones, displaced wildfire survivors, and more. California had 15 of its largest wildfires in the past 20 years. Climate change is only making them worse.\n\nI wrote an op-ed about what we can do to prevent these wildfires from becoming our new normal. That includes passing my Wildfire Defense Act. https://t.co/aMEmEWIBj0 We\u2019re months away from the start of the next major elections and the Senate hasn\u2019t taken up a single bill on election security.\n\nDr. Fiona Hill reaffirmed this week that Russians are gearing up to interfere again. What are Republican leaders waiting for? This is absurd. It's time we took bold steps to confront the housing and homelessness crisis in America. I introduced a bill this week with my friend @RepMaxineWaters to invest more than $100 billion in affordable housing across the country. https://t.co/7Nq5FtrgSO A recap of my 5 bills that passed House committees this week:\n\n-Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act\n-3 public lands bills to protect 1 million acres of land in California\n-and provisions from my Maternal CARE Act\n\nIt's time for the Senate to pass these bills. Immigrants make our nation stronger. This is the truth, and it\u2019s downright wrong for anyone to question the loyalties of the patriots who testified in Congress this week. https://t.co/m1os2aVNnD Trump continues to smear the reputation of Ambassador Yovanovitch for having the courage to speak the truth. But let me make one thing clear: Ambassador Yovanovitch has more courage and patriotism in her pinky than Trump ever will. https://t.co/hEnhbU69so The impeachment testimonies this week made one thing clear: the scheme to extort Ukraine goes all the way to the president himself. We have a criminal in the White House. Last month, I called on the State Department IG to investigate who at State worked with Giuliani on Trump\u2019s scheme to extort Ukraine.\n\nThis week, Sondland confirmed that Pompeo &amp; officials at State knew about it while it was happening. We need this independent investigation now. America must always be a place where refugees are welcomed. But as Trump continues to turn him back on refugees, we have to fight.\n\nProud to join @SenatorLeahy on a bill today to revitalize our refugee and asylum system and expand protections for these individuals. This cannot be overlooked from Dr. Fiona Hill\u2019s testimony today: \u201cRussia\u2019s security services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election. We are running out of time to stop them.\u201d\n\n@senatemajldr, it\u2019s past time to secure our elections. https://t.co/aWBgiEJQfT We are facing a housing and homelessness crisis. Too many Americans are fighting tooth and nail to keep a roof over their heads and it's time for bold action.\n\nI'm proud to introduce a bill today with @RepMaxineWaters to invest more than $100 billion in affordable housing. https://t.co/WVVNaHFRdD MUST WATCH: This morning, Dr. Fiona Hill reaffirmed what our Intelligence Community has been telling us for years: it was Russia\u2014not Ukraine\u2014that interfered in the 2016 election.\n\nRussia threatened the very heart of our democracy. Republicans must stop distorting the truth. https://t.co/uqM9qILpLM Throughout the impeachment inquiry, @SecPompeo has refused to give this kind of defense of brave career diplomats like Ambassador Yovanovitch &amp; dismissed the process entirely. Now we know that Pompeo played a direct role in Trump\u2019s scheme to extort Ukraine.\n\nThis is unacceptable. https://t.co/B6BAG6GlXG While my colleagues in the House are working on impeaching our lawless president, they're also legislating.\n\n5 of my bills on marijuana legalization, Black maternal health, and public lands have passed House committees this week. The Senate should do its job and pass these bills. Sondland\u2019s testimony today made it clear: the scheme to extort Ukraine in exchange for a public announcement to harm Trump\u2019s political opponents goes all the way to the president himself.\n\nThese are the facts. Now, it's on Congress to hold Trump accountable for his actions. https://t.co/ppG0DSAgTE Not only do we need to legalize marijuana at the federal level, but we have to do it right and bring justice to communities of color.\n\nMy bill with @RepJerryNadler will do that\u2014and it just passed committee in the House.

In 2019, at least 22 people have been killed right here in the US. #TDoR2019 My friend @RepAdamSchiff is exactly right. The president and his administration released the aid to Ukraine only after they got caught.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean they did the right thing\u2014it means they knew what they did was wrong. https://t.co/pEEWBITcOX This is huge. Provisions from my Maternal CARE Act with @RepAdams, including implicit bias training for health care providers, have passed committee in the House.\n\nThrilled Congress is one step closer to addressing the Black maternal health crisis in America. Let\u2019s get this done. https://t.co/4Wo2Snzs3h Climate change is fueling more intense natural disasters that threaten to unleash some of our nation\u2019s most toxic waste sites on surrounding areas.\n \nThat's why I introduced a bill today to ensure toxic waste sites are resilient to climate change. https://t.co/bOwaTcrGFU Lieutenant Colonel Vindman is the embodiment of the American dream, and his message to his father earlier today cannot be overlooked. He is a true profile in courage. https://t.co/KibXIqZLgr Right now, there's a case before the Supreme Court that threatens to limit our oldest civil rights law. This could prevent countless people of color from pursuing claims of race discrimination in our courts.\n\nProud to lead my colleagues in a resolution today supporting the law. Let me be absolutely clear about this: it is beneath the dignity of Congress to question the loyalty of a decorated Army officer and Purple Heart recipient who has selflessly served our country for 20 years. https://t.co/nL7OoNYtYC The Trump administration put out a misleading report designed to smear DACA recipients. But the American people know the truth: DACA recipients are students, doctors &amp; military service members who have passed rigorous background checks. They are not hardened criminals. No one should have to worry about whether they\u2019ll be able to afford the prescription drugs they or their loved ones need to stay alive.\n\nProud to join @SenBooker on this bill to crack down on pharmaceutical industry greed and lower the price of prescription drugs. https://t.co/T4kQ1FreGm The climate crisis is here and it\u2019s in our backyard. For Californians, that means recognizing that wildfire seasons are getting worse and preparing our communities for the challenges ahead.\n \nThat's why I introduced the Wildfire Defense Act\u2014read my op-ed. https://t.co/GhBnsJBrk2 The War on Drugs was an abject failure. It's time to legalize marijuana and bring justice to people of color harmed by failed drug policies.\n\nGrateful for @RepJerryNadler\u2019s partnership on this issue. I look forward to getting our bill one step closer to becoming law. https://t.co/Qd5wqPfrdT Ambassador Yovanovitch's testimony made clear her commitment to speaking truth &amp; upholding the rule of law.\n\nOn Wednesday, the American people will hear directly from Ambassador Sondland about his involvement with the president's scheme in Ukraine. They deserve to hear the truth. https://t.co/zdIimaYgWW Once again, Trump has reversed course on addressing real issues that impact our well being. We saw it before when he caved to the NRA on gun safety. Now, it's flavored vapes. https://t.co/wXSsKId2eq Less than one week after the shooting at Saugus High School, another mass shooting has taken place in California. Thankful for the first responders who were on the scene last night in Fresno, and my thoughts are with those affected.\n\nAmericans are tired of this. We need to act. https://t.co/WRFk0Q32FC ICE is trying to undermine California's ban on private prisons, including private immigration detention facilities, by rushing new contracts before the law takes effect. This is outrageous\u2014I've sent them a letter demanding answers. Nebane Abienwi died in US custody after fleeing violence in Cameroon. For more than a month, his loved ones have desperately searched for answers-to no avail. My thoughts are with his family and the Cameroonian community as they continue to fight for his body's return. We need to end solitary confinement, and that includes ICE's inappropriate use of it with detained individuals. I introduced a bill last week with @SenatorDurbin to combat the rampant and unnecessary use of solitary confinement in ICE operated and ICE contract facilities. Earlier this week, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that will determine the fate of DACA. Let me be clear about one thing: there shouldn\u2019t be a \u201cleft\u201d or \u201cright\u201d when it comes to protecting DACA recipients. There is a right and wrong. Period. #HeretoStay Gracie and Dominic had so much life to live. Instead, their lives were senselessly cut short by gun violence this week at Saugus High School.\n \nSay their names. Remember them. We can\u2019t let this be our normal. https://t.co/iDT2QnlhUI It's simple: if a power or water company is filing for bankruptcy, their executives shouldn't be getting millions of dollars in bonuses and free trips.\n\nAfter @PGE4Me tried to do this in CA, I introduced a bill to ensure utility companies in bankruptcy can't attempt this again. California has been devastated by wildfires\u2014and we know that more are coming. With climate change creating conditions for more intense wildfires, we have to prepare.\n\nI announced a bill today to protect Americans from the growing threat of wildfires. https://t.co/W9r7FEiUSp Trump is continuing to intimidate witnesses \u2013 and Congress can see it in real time on Twitter. Former prosecutors like @RepAdamSchiff know it when we see it.  https://t.co/LE1Ud8yR6l This isn't the first time powerful forces have attempted to smear a woman for speaking the truth. Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch is a life-long civil servant and a true American patriot. I thank her for her service and for having the courage to testify today. https://t.co/7dcSyd5PxZ Last week, I asked the FBI Director whether Giuliani was a counterintelligence threat. He wouldn't say.\n\nWe just found out Giuliani is under investigation for multiple crimes for his overseas dealings\u2014and still has nighttime talks with the president. This is a *huge* red flag. https://t.co/J7cQyntQCu Our children are being traumatized by gun violence. This is tragic, preventable, and it has to stop. https://t.co/3GX1KN1Xy6 As news broke of the shooting at Saugus High School, my friend Chris Murphy was on the Senate floor demanding action on gun safety. Republicans rejected his proposal.\n \nI\u2019m fed up with the inaction on gun violence. https://t.co/quIn5vvHRB Officials have just confirmed that 1 student has passed away from the shooting at Saugus High School. This is heartbreaking\u2014my thoughts are with her family and loved ones.\n\nWe cannot accept this as normal. Enough is enough. We need reasonable gun safety laws in our country. https://t.co/irEys2iOzs My office is monitoring the situation\u2014please avoid the area around Saugus High School. Grateful for first responders who are on the scene. https://t.co/eqzHpeJXzi Watch this questioning by @RepValDemings. This is exactly why I've called for an investigation into Rudy Giuliani's work with State Department officials.\n\nWe need to know exactly who in this administration is working with Giuliani against American interests. https://t.co/Izw9OPosAX I'm proud to cosponsor the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act in the Senate. It's time we ensured support for survivors of sexual assault and more protections for LGBTQ+ Americans, Native women, and immigrant women. There's no reason for the Senate to delay passing this. Today, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that could narrow the oldest civil rights law in our country. \n\nIn September, I wrote to the Court in support of the law and its importance in fighting race discrimination in America. We must keep it intact\u2014justice is at stake. Right now, #DACA recipients can't travel abroad without the risk of losing their status\u2014including to visit family who are sick or dying. That's simply inhumane. I'm calling on the Trump administration to end this cruel policy.

We need answers. https://t.co/Ru53UdhAiU In 2017, I asked then-DHS Secretary John Kelly whether he had ever met a DREAMer\u2014he said no. It's clear that this administration still cares more about demonizing these young people than recognizing their full humanity. They should read this: https://t.co/4Cdd2H6AF5 In October, I sent a letter to every Trump cabinet official demanding they \"Report any effort within your department or the White House to interfere with, intimidate, or otherwise obstruct an investigation by the relevant inspector general or Congress.\"\n\nIt\u2019s their duty. https://t.co/b5BSomsOIe Let\u2019s not mince words: more people will die because of this decision. https://t.co/SmRbKLfak8 Utterly disgraceful for the president to attack DACA recipients with this lie. So here\u2019s the truth: DACA recipients are students, military service members, doctors, and people who contribute to our economy. They are American in every way but on paper. #HeretoStay https://t.co/YeydeazW2d California has more at stake in SCOTUS\u2019s decision on the fate of #DACA than any other state. To the 220,000 DREAMers in California: you belong here, and we will fight for your right to live in the country you call home. As we honor veterans who have served our nation, we cannot forget the hundreds of DREAMers who have served in our Armed Forces. We should honor these patriots by giving them a pathway to citizenship. It's just the right thing to do. We need to know whether Trump improperly requested that Attorney General Barr hold a news conference exonerating him on Ukraine.\n\nTrump denies that he did. If he's telling the truth, Barr should have no problem expediting my request for documents. Immediately. https://t.co/cIJI3QbBIz This Veterans Day, we honor our veterans and their families in California and across the country who have sacrificed so much. Thank you for your service\u2014your courage will never be forgotten. Unacceptable.
