They told me later they had a backup standing by, in case I wasn\u2019t good.  When the promo aired, it got a \u201cCheers\u201d in TV Guide and now, I am America\u2019s sweetheart. @franklinavenue He asked me to come in anyway.  Someone then called and asked for my shirt size. I assumed it was because they were going to give me a t shirt.  When I got to Fox, they sat me in a makeup chair.  I still didn\u2019t know why. @franklinavenue OK Michael, but only for you.  When I was a young radio sports guy at @kroq, I had a side job punching up Fox network promo scripts. A guy named Geoff Calnan asked me to look at a promo script for a new show (POF). I told him the script looked good and I had nothing to add to it.
