Following his historic international run, Luka Doncic entered his name into the 2018 NBA Draft, where was selected 3rd overall. A draft night trade sent Luka to the Dallas Mavericks, where he began his NBA career. Luka took that momentum into the 2017-18 EuroLeague season, averaging 16.0 PPG, 4.8 RPG and 4.3 APG while leading Real Madrid to the Championship. \n\nLuka was named EuroLeague MVP and EuroLeague Final Four MVP. In the summer of 2017, Luka teamed up with future NBA All-Star Goran Dragic to lead Slovenia to the gold medal at FIBA EuroBasket 2017. He averaged 14.3 PPG and was named to the All-Tournament Team. In the 2016-17 season, Luka increased his role and playing time \u2013 averaging 7.8 PPG, 4.3 RPG and 3.1 APG in Liga ACB \u2013 while Real Madrid tallied a 25-7 record. At age 16, Luka made his Liga ACB debut with Real Madrid in 2014-15. He began seeing rotation minutes the following season, averaging 4.9 PPG in 14.2 MPG. Among the most highly-regarded youth players in European history, Luka signed with Real Madrid at age 13 to continue his skill development. Growing up in Slovenia, Luka was raised around the game of basketball. His father, Sasa Doncic, was a similarly-sized swingman who scored at a high rate across professional leagues in central and Eastern Europe during his career.
