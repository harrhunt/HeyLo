From #Fierce to #BTSarmy to #LifeSize2 to #StilettosInMyPurseFlatsOnMyFeet, I have enjoyed every use! \n\nNow that you\u2019re 11, can you tell @jack we need an edit button?! Look at @JanelleMonae all regal in yellow, like a supermodel Big Bird on Sesame Street where the letter of the day is F! Because she is FIERCE! Her music is as bright and impacting as this photo shot by @antmvh1 fave @yutsai88! https://t.co/41Y4RLoXXB What you\u2019re missing over on Instagram... @jvn can\u2019t even right now! https://t.co/a3Jstiv1tt I want YOU to know that I love you fiercely! \ud83d\udc9b https://t.co/7UpguTHq3V Sometimes you just gotta let your hair do the talkin! #agtsTYle https://t.co/MPN9xWKaC3 Strut, bitch! #AGT https://t.co/ZIPkvDSrNz Ladies, you always have a leg up on the competition! #agtsTYle https://t.co/1mAsILeCCu Who you kissin\u2019 these days? \ud83d\udc8b https://t.co/Pms7oBgu3a RT @LenaWaithe: Wow. Thank you @tyrabanks !! This is the highest compliment coming from YOU! Sending you lots of love! https://t.co/VHJJjOm\u2026 Long flowing hair isn\u2019t feminine beauty. Short, clean lines, or a shave isn\u2019t masculine beauty. Beauty is in the self-confidence you project, and the ownership of who YOU are! @LenaWaithe, I see you and applaud that fierce hairstyle you got goin\u2019 on! https://t.co/lGtOMPua7Y Iconic. Beyond any level of fierce. The way she brought Obama to tears, tossed her fur coat to the ground, and effortlessly hit every single note with so much passion and love for the sound. https://t.co/nncoLpaoIq Aretha the Queen. Aretha Franklin epitomized that fierce black woman soul with just enough touch of pain in her vibrato, to make every human bow down to those precious vocals that only she could produce. May the heavens above shout with eternal pride, R-E-S-P-E-C-T! I wonder what age my son will be when me kissing his lil\u2019 cute feet will stop. Who said an Oscar had to be a man?! \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \ud83c\udfc6 \n#LookinLikeAnAcademyAward #agtsTYle https://t.co/GFtfqnVjL7 I love that these FIERCE AND FINE ASIAN MEN can do things in heels, that I can't! #PinoyPower https://t.co/wiQ3WA3egf \ud83d\udc9b Golden Goddess \ud83d\udc9b #AGT https://t.co/vVkdHo1NLr What\u2019s that #agtsTYle gonna be like tonight? https://t.co/DXEqvWrIIq If I didn\u2019t @instagram that amazing carb loaded meal I just ate, do the calories from the bacon, mayo &amp; cheese whiz count? There\u2019s so much power in silence. Most times, it\u2019s the loudest a person can be. That\u2019s a wrap on #LifeSize2 filming. \n\nSee you this December on @FreeformTV with the best Holiday movie of the year! https://t.co/yCW3KWady6 I always say to take your fierceness to the next level, and I\u2019m practicing what I preach!! \n\nThis new adventure will allow me to continue to dominate reality television, and create scripted programming that delights, empowers and entertains you! https://t.co/4d8gE0b9EH Caught in the moment, caught by surprise, even behind sunglasses, you betta smize! https://t.co/0HY3NMwVpv Fun Fact: Sometimes you don\u2019t need a filter.

Because they are exactly that...personal. I see so many others sharing SO MUCH and often ask myself, \u201cShould I?\u201d But in the end, I just don\u2019t. I hate it that I feel guilty when enjoying a rare, beautiful moment without pulling out my damn phone, snapping pic and sharing it. Dearest Avocado,\n\nPlease oh please be green inside and clear of anything that makes me scrape away unsightly parts of your insides. You all are so creative in so many ways! I love your creations and fun fan art. Just don\u2019t make me work too hard to stalk you to find it\u2026tag me in all your pieces! \n\nDo you think someone can recreate my image in the Rosie The Riveter style? https://t.co/FfbG3j0ofF Some of the best years of my life happened on my show, and knowing that you still talk about those memories we created together just fills me with so much joy. \n\nWe laughed, we cried, we grew stronger together.

Now that\u2019s fierce! https://t.co/10oHvC7wYY Wanna laugh until you pee on yourself? \n\nWell, I just watched @jimjefferies @netflix special and didn\u2019t pee on myself, but did laugh out loud while watching alone.
