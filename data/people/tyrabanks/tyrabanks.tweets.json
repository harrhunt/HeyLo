I\u2019m always down to try somewhere new when it\u2019s safe to travel super freely again!\ud83d\udc9b When I bit into this #ShappyPretzel, I had to hold onto the wall... it was SO dang good. \ud83e\udd68\n\nEven though restaurants are closed for dining in LA again, let\u2019s make sure to support those local small businesses by ordering to-go. https://t.co/tpegakSgIN Flashback FASHION Friday! \ud83c\udfa9 And we\u2019re headed back to September of \u201892 with this @voguemagazine shoot on top of some roof in NYC, photographed by the oh-so talented @maxvadukul. I was a baby - 18 years old! Should I bring back the top hat and animal print back?? \ud83e\udd93 https://t.co/aNia2so57D Anyone else rockin\u2019 a JLo perfume with me?? Ok ya\u2019ll.. embracing my inner @JLo this season on @dancingabc didn\u2019t stop at my fabulous, custom @versace scarves dress, oh no. I had my own JLo Glow perfume on deck! This wasn\u2019t a prop either, I\u2019ve been wearing this scent since she dropped it back in the day - it\u2019s that good! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd https://t.co/3colxcWuGf This first dress from finale night had me feelin\u2019 like I was about to float away like a cloud (and trip on the stairs!!!) Already can\u2019t wait until next season where you know we will take it up 10 notches. Cuz that\u2019s how we do.\ud83d\udc99 First Monday without my @dancingabc fam and I\u2019m already missing all the dance, the glitz and the glam, and getting to play dress up each and every week! https://t.co/cdF4Bkx828 Mentor, friend, visionary, embracer of weirdness &amp; oh so much fun. You didn\u2019t see the world how it was, but how U wanted it to be. Tony Hsieh, thank You for being a teacher to us all. Your innovative spirit, ideas &amp; plans will continue to thrive. Rest in HAPPINESS. \ud83d\udc9b https://t.co/IAN301CEdc This pic screams...I woke up like this \u2728 and by this I mean in a food coma. Who feels me?? Don\u2019t mind if I stay in bed and do some online shopping then hit up some of those leftovers later. Lemme know what you\u2019re shopping for or diggin into today! https://t.co/1eSTfB6Xcx Happy Thanksgiving from my family to yours! I\u2019m extra grateful for my mama this year. She is definitely #momgoals. Share your thanks for your mama, family, friends and kids in the replies. I wanna know who is important to you. \ud83d\udc9b https://t.co/7XsixJtRrv Congrats to these two winners of the #MirrorBall \ud83c\udfc6. @kaitlynbristowe &amp; @artemchigvintse so proud of you. \n#DWTS https://t.co/NB3Zi6QMD0 @kathyireland @DancingABC @TonyDovolani So sweet, @kathyireland. \ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b Sneaking up on you with those sneakers under my couture baby blue dress. \ud83e\udd2b @DancingABC finale is LIVE on east coast now!!! \ud83d\udc5f And that goes for YOU, too. Whether you\u2019re attacking a new hobby or dance move, keep on going! It\u2019s the dedication that counts more than anything!\ud83d\udc9b Tomorrow, it's the finale of @dancingabc, and a mirror ball winner will be CROWNED. The stars will showcase their intense moves taught by their pros. Some may hit them all on point, some may mess up, but the most important thing is to keep going, even if they forget a little. Flash forward to showtime... I forgot ALL the darn moves! Feet all over the place, arms not knowing what the heck to do, a mess! \ud83d\ude02 I kept my focus though. I attacked the moves with the intensity the choreographer taught me, but to my own crazy drum. For this runway, I studied and practiced with a choreographer that specialized in flamenco. I lived and breathed those moves. I knew them backwards and forwards. I was set! \ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udffd https://t.co/osvIrY8G66 Entrepreneurship is NO joke. But, If you start with what you love.. Every day that you wake up will not feel like work. \n\nMy passion? Ice cream. Go follow @smizecream to follow our journey as my team and I work tirelessly to bring the most super-premium ice cream to your palette! https://t.co/QhRlQM8q2M @patrickstarrr Yes, boo you sure are! \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99 Happy Saturday, y\u2019all!!

Who will it be? @Nelly_Mo, @kaitlynbristowe, @NevSchulman, or @JustinaMachado? These stars' journeys have been intense! It\u2019s not easy and takes courage to put yourself out there every week, especially when it's something you're not used to doing. To show up on that dance floor and say \u201cThis is Me!\u201d. I\u2019ve hosted TV for decades but it was my first time hosting this. It was also a new experience for the team to bring joy to homes across the country during such worldwide challenging times. But through it all, the crew came together to create such an amazing season! Let's hear it for our stars heading to the FINALS! \ud83c\udf89 It's been such a new experience for everyone this season on @dancingabc. https://t.co/z5UlBoUKum How incredible are these dancers @BrittBStewart and @Dance10Alan??\ud83d\udc9b We're going to miss them in the competition next week, but can't wait to see all of the amazing work they create next!

Beauty is in the self-confidence you project, and the ownership of who YOU are! @LenaWaithe, I see you and applaud that fierce hairstyle you got goin\u2019 on! https://t.co/lGtOMPua7Y Iconic. Beyond any level of fierce. The way she brought Obama to tears, tossed her fur coat to the ground, and effortlessly hit every single note with so much passion and love for the sound. https://t.co/nncoLpaoIq Aretha the Queen. Aretha Franklin epitomized that fierce black woman soul with just enough touch of pain in her vibrato, to make every human bow down to those precious vocals that only she could produce. May the heavens above shout with eternal pride, R-E-S-P-E-C-T! I wonder what age my son will be when me kissing his lil\u2019 cute feet will stop. Who said an Oscar had to be a man?! \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \ud83c\udfc6 \n#LookinLikeAnAcademyAward #agtsTYle https://t.co/GFtfqnVjL7 I love that these FIERCE AND FINE ASIAN MEN can do things in heels, that I can't! #PinoyPower https://t.co/wiQ3WA3egf \ud83d\udc9b Golden Goddess \ud83d\udc9b #AGT https://t.co/vVkdHo1NLr What\u2019s that #agtsTYle gonna be like tonight? https://t.co/DXEqvWrIIq If I didn\u2019t @instagram that amazing carb loaded meal I just ate, do the calories from the bacon, mayo &amp; cheese whiz count?

Because they are exactly that...personal. I see so many others sharing SO MUCH and often ask myself, \u201cShould I?\u201d But in the end, I just don\u2019t. I hate it that I feel guilty when enjoying a rare, beautiful moment without pulling out my damn phone, snapping pic and sharing it. Dearest Avocado,\n\nPlease oh please be green inside and clear of anything that makes me scrape away unsightly parts of your insides. You all are so creative in so many ways!
