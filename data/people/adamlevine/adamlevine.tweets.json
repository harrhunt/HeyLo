My team is beastly. .@blakeshelton Go ahead cowboy, make my day I can think of 62 other times you've been completely wrong @blakeshelton. You have no idea how happy @pharrell is right now\u2026 Check out the trailer for my bud's new film! http://t.co/cuV5OUM459 .@pharrell And I absolutely loved his work in \"Walk the Line\". Twice in one night @gwenstefani?? You're cold! I guess \"Stefani\" is not Italian for \"Blessing\". Sorry @gwenstefani, but thanks for keeping me on my toes. .@blakeshelton Settle down, Shelton. I don't appreciate the added pressure there @blakeshelton. Plus, you didn't tell me your 57th birthday was today. Happy birthday, man! How do I get rid of the commentator on the far end? He just doesn\u2019t seem to serve a purpose on this show\u2026 How have there been zero steals yet tonight? This season is just too good. Yep\u2026 he still has no idea what that word means\u2026 Do we dare ask @blakeshelton if he still knows how to do that Algebra he claims to have learned? Even I was getting scared watching that intense battle\u2026 @blakeshelton are you okay, buddy? Man, did you see the determination in @pharrell's eyes? That was scary for a second. #WatchingBlinds Find out who I am tonight on @nbcsnl http://t.co/NAz5scsmZQ .@blakeshelton you're giving me anxiety There are certain things in life that I'm sure of, beating @blakeshelton is one of them\u2026 at anything, really. I'm pretty sure we would have lost @pharrell for the night if she didn't choose him. #BlindsContinue Well that was a no brainer\u2026 @blakeshelton is also a no-brainer. .@blakeshelton I've been trying to separate from you for years, buddy. \u2026 oh shut up @blakeshelton. Don't feel bad @gwenstefani. I call that the \"Blake Shelton Geographical Pull\" effect. It seems to work 92% of the time. I can't BELIEVE you @blakeshelton. Gloves are coming off, cowboy. Collusion! That is straight up collusion. @pharell @gwenstefani I'm sorry you have to deal with Blake @gwenstefani @pharrell.
