My team is beastly. .@blakeshelton Go ahead cowboy, make my day I can think of 62 other times you've been completely wrong @blakeshelton. You have no idea how happy @pharrell is right now\u2026 Check out the trailer for my bud's new film! http://t.co/cuV5OUM459 .@pharrell And I absolutely loved his work in \"Walk the Line\". Twice in one night @gwenstefani?? You're cold! I guess \"Stefani\" is not Italian for \"Blessing\". Sorry @gwenstefani, but thanks for keeping me on my toes. .@blakeshelton Settle down, Shelton. I don't appreciate the added pressure there @blakeshelton. Plus, you didn't tell me your 57th birthday was today. Happy birthday, man! How do I get rid of the commentator on the far end? He just doesn\u2019t seem to serve a purpose on this show\u2026 How have there been zero steals yet tonight? This season is just too good. Yep\u2026 he still has no idea what that word means\u2026 Do we dare ask @blakeshelton if he still knows how to do that Algebra he claims to have learned? Even I was getting scared watching that intense battle\u2026 @blakeshelton are you okay, buddy? Man, did you see the determination in @pharrell's eyes? That was scary for a second. #WatchingBlinds Find out who I am tonight on @nbcsnl http://t.co/NAz5scsmZQ .@blakeshelton you're giving me anxiety There are certain things in life that I'm sure of, beating @blakeshelton is one of them\u2026 at anything, really. I'm pretty sure we would have lost @pharrell for the night if she didn't choose him. #BlindsContinue Well that was a no brainer\u2026 @blakeshelton is also a no-brainer. .@blakeshelton I've been trying to separate from you for years, buddy. \u2026 oh shut up @blakeshelton. Don't feel bad @gwenstefani. I call that the \"Blake Shelton Geographical Pull\" effect. It seems to work 92% of the time. I can't BELIEVE you @blakeshelton. Gloves are coming off, cowboy. Collusion! That is straight up collusion. @pharell @gwenstefani I'm sorry you have to deal with Blake @gwenstefani @pharrell.

I just bought it twice. Its all love all over the place here on @NBCTheVoice today! Watching @CeeLoGreen rehearse. There's nobody on planet earth quite like this man. #DIG No disrespect intended for @adamlambert ...I honesty had never heard the song before. I'm not one to take cheap shots like that. RT @maroon5: If you missed #moveslikejagger featuring @TheRealXtina last night on @NBCTheVoice you can watch here! http://t.co/ogjKXx0 I'm so proud to be part of a show that is actually impacting the music industry in a genuine way. #OVERWHELMED I promised @TheRealXtina that #moveslikejagger would go number one at iTunes. Help us do it so she doesn't punch me! Holy iTunes batman! #thevoice #moveslikejagger !!!! Ahhhhhh!!!! I had honestly never heard that song before. I thought that @nakia made me like a song that would have otherwise fallen flat. I'm NOT sorry. Wow. @NBCTheVoice was a LOT more intense than I thought it would be. RT @MarkBurnettTV: #TheVoice artists have grown so much. @TheRealXtina, @AdamLevine, @CeeLoGreen and @BlakeShelton have done a great job ... Man that was tough. I hope @JeffJenkins88 and @DcBarleyy know how special they are to me...I love you guys. hey @blakeshelton and @CeeLoGreen , what the hell are we doing here? RT @jamesbvalentine: Everyone look out for my new competing single, \"Riffs akin to Richards.\" #moveslikejagger RT @justinbieber: #MAKEACHANGE #SCHOOLS4ALL - http://t.co/DojsqXC It's the most beautiful day of the year so far.

Stopping by @jimmykimmel tonight! excited for the rest of @maroon5 to check out @NBCTheVoice on tuesday! it feels almost like a second living room. Watching the most awkward movie I've ever seen in my life. The Disney Channel is freaking me out right now. Happy fathers day!!! Happy birthday @scooterbraun ...good times last night. I really really really really want this plane to take off now please. RT @questlove: RIP Clarence Clemons. A True Legend. Will be absolutely missed. Maybe not old. Just not that young. I hurt my back on stage for the first time. Wow. I guess that means I'm old now. @casey_weston they did. It was a big mess. I hope she finds it. Her husband or husband to be looks PISSED. San Fran. Dig it. A brief but exciting journey...a woman just waved to us  from her car and her wedding ring flew off into the street. I've gotta stop tweeting DM's as normal tweets. I feel like the grandfather who talks to the answering machine. Motley Cr\u00fce in Vegas tomorrow. How could I possibly justify not going? RT @TheRemainers: The Remainers are @kroq finalists!

And I like that kids are cussing in movies again. EPIC.  http://lockerz.com/s/110952759 Jealous...RT @CeeLoGreen: @NikkiSixx NIKKI thanks so much letting me rock with the crue!!!!

You have nothing to worry about. I'm so proud of you! At the dress rehearsals for @NBCTheVoice ...Insanity! Leno was great. Pulling up to rehearse with @TeamAdaam ! #thebestteam Congrats to the Dallas Mavericks. You guys deserved this one. #NOHEAT @HartHanson im pretty sure Russia. But who knows? I'm pretty jet lagged these days. Heard Fat Joe lost 88 pounds. Now he's more like,  \"Average\" Joe. Get it? Get it? #I'llbehereallweek Wow. So, I'm currently in Moscow, Vegas, AND Los Angeles simultaneously. Although technically I'm just in Moscow. It's complicated. Watching get him to the Greek. I LOVE this movie. And @iamdiddy is friggin' hysterical in it. Really excited about Stereo Hearts. And everyone seems to be loving it! @ItsBennyBlanco men who got them before they were deemed \"tramp stamps\"...poor bastards. Here we go Las Vegas. Be kind. Please be kind. #imscared It's funny when the losing team states the obvious. \"they scored more points. They made more baskets. They played better defense.\" #NOSHIT RT @Kurt_Vonnegut: Enjoy the little things in life, for one day you'll look back and realize they were big things. Great day hanging with @TeamAdaam ...I really love these guys! Go see @rozzicrane at the Hotel Cafe in Los Angeles. Tonight at 7pm. Just trust me... Actually. Now i kinda want to see the new Xmen movie. I mean. I love showtunes. But I'm not a tough mutant with metal claws and a dark past. That being said. Hugh Jackman. I mean...is there ANYTHING this guy can't do? Seriously folks. Kinda just dont care about Xmen anymore. I think it was more effective before we found out that Wolverine was SUUUUPER down with showtunes. Watching some terrible action movie with lots of gratuitous nudity, guns, and no discernible plot...in other words...it's AWESOME. @CeeLoGreen that looks like the DeathStar! @TeamAdaam is preparing for an incredible show! I'm lucky to be working with @JeffJenkins88 @Javstwtr @casey_weston and @DcBarleyy @1NatalieMaines I love that you love the show!
