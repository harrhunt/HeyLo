I\u2019ve had the same best friends since I was 13. \u2013 Matty // G U Y S // L O V E https://t.co/lm7phLnPxI I didn\u2019t write that song; my dad wrote it in the 90\u2019s. It\u2019s the only 1975 song that I\u2019m not credited as a writer on. The reason I put it on the record was because I was going through what influenced me, and that was the first song I ever knew. \u2013 Matty // D O N T W O R R Y // L O V E https://t.co/M9eYRkIAm7 We were listening to music and sailing by Christopher Cross came on and I remember saying to George, \u2018do you remember back in the day when I said this would make an amazing garage sample\u2019 and we kind of looked at each other like \u2018fuck\u2019. \u2013 Matty // B A G S Y N O T I N N E T // L O V E https://t.co/udSetI4Tie It was really hard to finish, really difficult to know what it was like. Every time we heard the female vocal, the synth chorus we thought \"that\u2019s really powerful, but what is it? Is it a chorus is it a verse? Is that an intro?\" We just couldn\u2019t figure it out. \u2013 Matty // W H A T S H O U L D I S A Y // L O V E https://t.co/aailPBvgv0 Read about Douglas Harding - George // H A V I N G N O H E A D // L O V E https://t.co/fDTuGqQSVC // P L A Y I N G O N M Y M I N D // L O V E https://t.co/qeXQUZI6bK I think this song is what punk is right now, because it\u2019s brash and it\u2019s out there. It references stuff that\u2019s come before but it doesn\u2019t sound like anything else. I know we do that all the time, but to me it feels like doing the expected is now quite subversive. \u2013 Matty // I F Y O U R E T O O S H Y ( L E T M E K N O W )) // L O V E https://t.co/GDKsU20Utk George made this arrangement of sounds and sent it to Cutty Ranks saying this is my interpretation of what the lyrics would be. One of the lines rhythmically sounded to George like \u2018killing resulting in microphone culture\u2019, which is one of the best lines on the album.  \u2013 Matty // S H I N Y C O L L A R B O N E // L O V E https://t.co/7xdDe7TRyG I struggled with this song because it was almost like a sonic experiment, a mixture of samples. \u2013 Matty // T O N I G H T ( I W I S H I W A S Y O U R B O Y ) // L O V E https://t.co/Zj9RW4o3sA RT @1975hann: Piano is so lush It\u2019s a very unique vocal delivery on this song. I wouldn\u2019t call it rapping, it\u2019s just flow. I get to kind of flow and rhythmically punctuate with words. \u2013 Matty // N O T H I N G R E V E A L E D / E V E R Y T H I N G D E N I E D // L O V E https://t.co/SuHkHoYyI0 Referencing old lyrics is very me, because it\u2019s never a different story, it\u2019s a continuation of the story. I think post-modernism drives a lot of my work. \u2013 Matty // I T H I N K T H E R E S S O M E T H I N G Y O U S H O U L D K N O W // L O V E https://t.co/xu1DHBbkQ1 // M E &amp; Y O U T O G E T H E R S O N G // L O V E https://t.co/qML0C0OdkT \"Roadkill\" is me writing a song about being on the road. \u2013 Matty // R O A D K I L L // L O V E https://t.co/Cin04ApfVe // J E S U S C H R I S T 2 0 0 5 G O D B L E S S A M E R I C A // L O V E https://t.co/4GNK4QFJBF Having other people involved in what I do gives me anxiety a lot of the time, but none of that happened with Phoebe. It was quite casual, it was like finding an instrument for me. \u2013 Matty // T H E N B E C A U S E S H E G O E S // L O V E https://t.co/XsTTzcjdGG Yeah I Know is one modular synth sound, one beat and three or four lyrics. Stark simplicity, with purpose. \u2013 Matty // Y E A H I K N O W // L O V E https://t.co/dtGb8nev5F The Birthday Party was written as a drumbeat, baseline and vocals and then everything else came around it.

It started as a loose, synth ambient piece of music. \u2013 Matty // S T R E A M I N G // L O V E https://t.co/Gur4mMtQRv RT @DirtyHit: You guys might be proud, but you will never come close to how proud I am of @Truman_Black @Gdans1975 and @1975hann We\u2019ve been a band for 17 years and the main reason we make lots of different types of music is because if we didn\u2019t, we\u2019d be fucking bored. Reaching to be bold is more avoiding being bored. \u2013 Matty // F R A I L S T A T E O F M I N D // L O V E https://t.co/4a5ENWuXcF Ambient music - music with no lyrics - generates every emotional, sonic quality of The 1975. All the ambient moments, be them quite sprawling or epic or delicate, it\u2019s essentially the engine left running in between songs. \u2013 Matty // T H E E N D ( M U S I C F O R C A R S ) // L O V E https://t.co/ItoOThABmW \u201cPeople\u201d is about young voices of progression being drowned out by old regressive ideals. It sounds and feels like anger and momentum, like falling forward. \u2013 Matty // P E O P L E // L O V E https://t.co/sdrprkatt1 It is inspiring being in a room with Greta as she is only interested in her cause. It\u2019s not an intimidating presence, or a cold presence, but it\u2019s a real sense of purpose and that instilled a sense of optimism in me. \u2013 Matty // T H E 1 9 7 5 // L O V E https://t.co/puXCl6wAwI RT @the1975: // N O A C F - L I S T E N I N G P A R T Y - 1 0 M I N U T E S // @TwitterMusic L O V E #the1975 https://t.co/CMaYOANpbx https\u2026 RT @the1975: // N O A C F - L I S T E N I N G P A R T Y - 3 0 M I N U T E S // @TwitterMusic L O V E #the1975 https://t.co/KPoiRmGGh7 https\u2026 // N O A C F - L I S T E N I N G P A R T Y - O N E H O U R // L O V E #the1975 https://t.co/Dq8JNkH2VJ 100% chance of bops on this #NewMusicFriday \n\n\ud83c\udfb5 @ladygaga, @ArianaGrande \n\ud83c\udfb5 @carlyraejepsen \n\ud83c\udfb5 @the1975 \n\ud83c\udfb5 @HAIMtheband \n\ud83c\udfb5 @Sia \n\ud83c\udfb5 @phoebe_bridgers \n\ud83c\udfb5 @1GunnaGunna \n\ud83c\udfb5 @Migos \n\ud83c\udfb5 @rodwave \n\ud83c\udfb5 @ToveLo \n\ud83c\udfb5 @elliegoulding \n\ud83c\udfb5 @gracieabrams \n+more\n\nWhat are you streaming? reply if there\u2019s a song more iconic than rain on me RAIN ON ME https://t.co/LSDYBVlTqv RT @ArianaGrande: https://t.co/AYbSiyZosl RT @ArianaGrande: woaaah @ladygaga we just might give these guys the keys to our account tomorrow stay tuned https://t.co/Jum0TXjTFE RT @ladygaga: Love u @ArianaGrande let\u2019s do this.
