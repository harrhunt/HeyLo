I urge Congress to come together to find long term solutions to our entire immigration system so we can create a safe, orderly, and humane immigration system, tackle the root causes of migration and legalize the undocumented population in the United States. Undocumented farm workers feed America and have been on the frontlines of this pandemic making sure we have food on our tables. The Farm Workforce Modernization Act provides a path to citizenship for these essential workers. I urge Congress to pass the bill. It\u2019s long past time Congress gives a path to citizenship for Dreamers and TPS recipients who strengthen our country and call our nation home. I strongly support the Dream and Promise Act and urge all members of the House to vote yes. Had to wear my lucky tie for St. Patrick\u2019s Day. https://t.co/PqJqwglJQP Writing and passing the Violence Against Women Act is one of the accomplishments of which I\u2019m most proud.

This afternoon, I brought together a bipartisan group of lawmakers to discuss how we can get it done. https://t.co/i6JUXGvHdI Your actions can save lives and change the course of this pandemic. https://t.co/zol6DDqDi1 A plan for all of America \u2014 supported by the majority of America. https://t.co/Rmd2DCaDNP On February 15, my Administration opened a special enrollment period for health insurance and more than 200,000 Americans have already gotten covered. It\u2019s an encouraging sign, but we have further to go. Head to https://t.co/gRX1fGFEzj before May 15 to get covered. An educator is leading the Department of Education once again. I look forward to working with @SecCardona to safely reopen our nation\u2019s schools and ensure every child has access to a quality education. https://t.co/5wO9lpR4ct I\u2019m grateful House and Senate Democrats introduced legislation today to strengthen our background check system. I helped pass the Brady background check bill as a Senator \u2014 and I\u2019m committed to continuing that work and passing common-sense gun safety reforms as president. The countless leaders who turned to Vernon Jordan for guidance did so because when he spoke, you could hear in his rich baritone the belief in an America that was capable of becoming an ever-more perfect union. It was a journey he\u2019d lived. https://t.co/wE4A16zAUy The bottom line is this: We need the American Rescue Plan now. https://t.co/Aop0DoFych The fight against COVID-19 is a war-time effort \u2014 and to win, we need breakthrough approaches. Today, I\u2019m announcing we\u2019re bringing together Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, and the full power of the federal government to ramp up vaccine production and defeat this virus. https://t.co/knu1PIXOtl Today, I am directing every state to prioritize educators for vaccination. We want every educator, school staff member, and child-care worker to receive at least one shot by the end of this month.\n\nIt\u2019s time to treat in-person learning like the essential service that it is. Three weeks ago, I announced we would have enough vaccine supply for all Americans by the end of July.\n\nNow, with our efforts to ramp up production, we will have enough vaccines for every American by the end of May. This afternoon, I\u2019m announcing a new partnership between Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck that will increase vaccine production and help defeat COVID-19. Tune in. https://t.co/e4WfFa4DXd The fact is that $600 is not enough. The Senate needs to pass the American Rescue Plan and finish the job of delivering $2,000 in direct relief. I had a great meeting with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador this afternoon. From migration to climate change \u2014 we\u2019re committed to working closely together to make progress on the challenges we face. https://t.co/M7T6CF8Fel Wash your hands.\nStay socially distanced.\nWear a mask.\nGet vaccinated when it\u2019s your turn.\n\nDespite our progress, we can\u2019t let our guard down. During Women's History Month, let us honor the accomplished and visionary women who have helped build our country. And let us pay tribute to the trailblazers from the recent and distant past for building a nation of endless possibilities for all of its women and girls. This afternoon, I\u2019ll be meeting virtually with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. The U.S.-Mexico relationship is broad and deep \u2014 and I look forward to ushering in a new phase of cooperation and progress. No child in America should go hungry. The American Rescue Plan will extend and invest in critical food programs to help ensure every family gets the food they need. https://t.co/DlKYDM6bOM On Saturday, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. Dr. Fauci sat down to answer your questions. https://t.co/KJQ2SrVclp RT @WhiteHouse: To celebrate Black History Month, the St. Augustine Gospel Choir was invited to the White House for a special performance.\u2026 Workers in Alabama \u2013 and all across America \u2013 are voting on whether to organize a union in their workplace. It\u2019s a vitally important choice \u2013 one that should be made without intimidation or threats by employers.\n\nEvery worker should have a free and fair choice to join a union. https://t.co/2lzbyyii1g The more people that get vaccinated, the faster we will beat this pandemic. That\u2019s why one of my first goals is to administer 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in our first 100 days.\n \nI\u2019m proud to say we\u2019re over halfway to our goal and weeks ahead of schedule. After a rigorous scientific review process, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for a third safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. It\u2019s exciting news for all Americans, and an encouraging development in our efforts to bring an end to the crisis. https://t.co/jVRjdRie9V Yesterday I traveled to Texas to visit an emergency operations center, food bank, and vaccination site. Each stop represented our nation at its best\u2014people coming together to help their fellow Americans. It\u2019s a reminder that there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t do when we do it together. https://t.co/6WgPbD0PCx Thank you to @SpeakerPelosi for your leadership and everyone in the House who supported the American Rescue Plan. Now, the bill heads to the Senate and there\u2019s no time to waste. If we act quickly and decisively, we can finally get ahead of this virus and get our economy moving. This morning, I\u2019m speaking about the American Rescue Plan. Tune in. https://t.co/8N5AZ8Y6H6 Because of the selfless dedication of nurses like Erica \u2014 and countless other folks across the country \u2014 we\u2019re going to beat this virus. I called to thank her and discuss what we can do to help. https://t.co/XRfNDgwNkX RT @WhiteHouse: Tune in as the President, First Lady, Vice President, and Second Gentleman host a White House Black History Month Celebrati\u2026 This week, our Administration opened a new vaccination site at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas. Tune in as I visit the site and deliver remarks. https://t.co/YD92UXX2sM If there is one message that needs to cut through it\u2019s this: the vaccines are safe and effective. https://t.co/S2eA24D9Gj The week before I took office, 6 million COVID-19 vaccine shots were administered.\n\nThis coming week, our Administration will likely administer over 12 million shots.\n\nThat\u2019s double the pace in just six weeks. COVID-19 vaccinations are up and cases and hospitalizations are down, but let me be clear: now is not the time to relax. https://t.co/oUuHCXl3s7 Transgender rights are human rights \u2014 and the House made that clear today by passing the Equality Act. \n\nNow it's time for the Senate to do the same. I launched a whole-of-government initiative to tackle the climate crisis during my first weeks in office \u2014 and as the Secretary of Energy, @SecGranholm will play a crucial role. I look forward to working with her to create good-paying, union jobs and build a clean energy economy. https://t.co/dVIGBtUBvE This afternoon, we\u2019re reaching a big milestone: 50 million COVID-19 vaccine doses administered since I took office. Tune in as we mark our progress and chart the path forward. https://t.co/uJ27tu7LxB I believe every American deserves the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care. That\u2019s why we opened a special health insurance enrollment period to ensure everyone can get covered. Head to https://t.co/gRX1fGFEzj to find the plan that works best for you. I am pleased that the House will vote next week on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. I encourage the House to pass it. Following Senate consideration, I hope to be able to sign into law a landmark police reform bill. Yesterday, I met with a bipartisan group of House and Senate members to discuss U.S. supply chains and then took executive action to strengthen them. The American people should never face shortages when it comes to the goods and services they rely on. https://t.co/y342c3AX5C I\u2019ve known Secretary Vilsack for years, and there\u2019s no doubt the USDA is in good hands with him at the helm once again. I look forward to working with him to support America\u2019s farmers, tackle hunger and climate change, and rebuild our rural economies. https://t.co/d0niNqQOsU Wearing a mask is one of the most important things we can do to protect others and change the course of this pandemic. That\u2019s why over the next few weeks, we\u2019re delivering over 25 million masks to community health centers, food pantries, and soup kitchens across the country. Just over a month ago, America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country. That changed the moment we took office. https://t.co/RPEf6Ce16b This afternoon, I\u2019m signing an executive order to create more resilient and secure supply chains for critical and essential goods. Tune in. https://t.co/7LyrNa38H5 Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield is right: Diplomacy is back and it\u2019s at the center of our foreign policy. I look forward to working with her to rebuild our alliances, take on global challenges, and restore America\u2019s leadership on the world stage. https://t.co/I2Uj4C8lio When I met with Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau in 2016, I said the world needed more leaders like him. A lot has changed since then, but my sentiment remains the same. I can\u2019t wait to see what we accomplish in the years ahead. https://t.co/jRJH7fpm2R Small businesses need relief, but many were muscled out of the way by big companies last year. That\u2019s why starting today, we\u2019re opening an exclusive 14-day loan application period for businesses and nonprofits with fewer than 20 employees.\n\nLearn more: https://t.co/JlLS2kNadK https://t.co/Nn36MTol8E Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau is right \u2014 it\u2019ll take teamwork to tackle the biggest challenges our nations face. That\u2019s why we\u2019re announcing the U.S.-Canada Partnership Roadmap \u2014 a blueprint for the whole-of-government relationship between our two nations. https://t.co/9GlS9QcTWA We have been fighting this pandemic for far too long, but we have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow. Because in order to heal, we must remember. https://t.co/FOmIfI2JX6 It was great to be back with Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau this afternoon. Whether it\u2019s combating COVID-19 or tackling the climate crisis \u2014 we\u2019re committed to working side-by-side on the biggest challenges we face. https://t.co/eNm6uX6Bec I just met with Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau \u2013 my first bilateral meeting as president.

The United States and Canada share a unique bond and close friendship \u2014 and I\u2019m committed to strengthening our partnership in the years ahead. Not many people have Oval Office walk-in privileges. Happy to report that these two are on the list. https://t.co/DRfr9hMsyW This afternoon, I\u2019m holding a roundtable discussion with Domestic Policy Advisor @AmbRice46 and Black essential workers. Tune in. https://t.co/8OEtENIJuf A Black man should be able to go for a jog without fearing for his life. Today, we remember Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s life and we dedicate ourselves to making this country safer for people of color. We will get through this, I promise you. https://t.co/dtmi4C9WsM We often hear people described as ordinary Americans. There's no such thing. There's nothing ordinary about them. The people we\u2019ve lost to COVID-19 were extraordinary. To heal, we must remember. https://t.co/LVfAnRpHlW It's not Democrats and Republicans who are dying from the virus. It's our fellow Americans. It's our neighbors, our friends, our mothers, our fathers, our sons, our daughters, husbands, wives.\n\nWe have to fight this together, as one people, as the United States. Today, our nation passed another grim milestone in this pandemic: 500,000 lives lost. Join us as we honor their memory. https://t.co/AzUzXoVUgb 500,000 lives lost to COVID-19. It\u2019s an unfathomable number, but each one represents a family that will never again be whole. To those who have lost loved ones: I know no words can numb the pain, but I hope you find some solace in knowing the nation grieves with you. I know folks have a lot of questions about COVID-19 mutations, our vaccination progress, and much more. @CDCDirector Dr. Walensky sat down to provide answers. https://t.co/K0Rlkc4Ti2 Small businesses are the backbone of our communities \u2013 and far too many are on the brink of closing their doors. Tune in as I announce additional steps we\u2019re taking to support them. https://t.co/BHhUV3nzng If there\u2019s one message I want to cut through to everyone in this country, it\u2019s this: The vaccines are safe.\n\nFor yourself, your family, your community, our country \u2014 take the vaccine when it\u2019s your turn and available. That\u2019s how we\u2019ll beat this pandemic. When I said I would listen to the scientists as president, I meant it. https://t.co/VeC7qGESID Today would have been Congressman John Lewis\u2019 81st birthday. While my dear friend may no longer be with us, his life and legacy provide an eternal moral compass on which direction to march. May we carry on his mission in the fight for justice and equality for all. On Friday, I visited Kalamazoo, Michigan to tour a Pfizer manufacturing plant. I had an opportunity to see the COVID-19 vaccine production process up close and thank the workers for their tireless efforts \u2013 because of their hard work we\u2019re going to beat COVID-19. https://t.co/tt0vYyskE9 Overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic needs to be our top priority as a nation. I joined members of my team to talk about our plan to get it done. https://t.co/LIiwFrwKRc One month down. https://t.co/mlpa5Pl9JQ The federal government has sent generators, blankets, water, and other critical supplies to Texas, but local organizations on the ground need help. Here\u2019s how you can pitch in. https://t.co/gp6PaGe87G On Tuesday, I\u2019ll be meeting virtually with @CanadianPM Justin Trudeau. I look forward to renewing the strong friendship between the United States and Canada and working to tackle the shared challenges we face. On Thursday, I joined the world and watched in awe as the Perseverance Rover touched down on the surface of Mars. It was a remarkable feat \u2014 one made possible by the hard work and ingenuity of the team at @NASA.\n\nI called to congratulate them on their historic landing. https://t.co/0Qjs2MDk4J I know a lot of folks have questions about when you\u2019ll get your stimulus checks and how we\u2019re increasing vaccine production, so I sat down to answer a few. https://t.co/tzAt5zeUnN This afternoon, I\u2019m touring a Pfizer manufacturing site in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and delivering remarks on our efforts to vaccinate America. Tune in. https://t.co/UY2yHNjaXv This morning, I met with my fellow G7 leaders for the first time as president. I made clear that America is back at the table \u2014 and I\u2019m committed to working with them to control the pandemic and address the shared challenges we face. https://t.co/TM1zAhWiPY Today, America is officially back in the Paris Climate Agreement. Let\u2019s get to work. As vice president, I worked closely with America\u2019s democratic partners to advance our shared vision and values. As president, I\u2019ll work with our partners and allies to defeat COVID-19 and advance peace and shared prosperity around the world.\n\nAmerica is back. https://t.co/ZcrgonHh2N This morning, I\u2019m delivering remarks on the partnership between Europe and the United States at a special event hosted by the Munich Security Conference. Tune in. https://t.co/QDhEw6oytK The Equality Act provides long overdue federal civil rights protections for LGBTQ+ Americans, preventing discrimination in our housing, education, public services, and lending systems. I urge Congress to swiftly pass this historic legislation. Tonight, I called Governor Greg Abbott to discuss the ongoing situation in Texas and identify ways we can support the state\u2019s recovery from this storm. I made clear to the Governor that I\u2019ll work relentlessly to get his state what they need. https://t.co/UBwH8DMep2 The truth is the last four years have exacerbated our already broken immigration system. The legislation I sent to Congress will bring about much-needed reform and restore humanity to our policies. I look forward to working with Congress to get it done. https://t.co/35U0J3NgQr Wear a mask.\nSocially distance.\nWash your hands.\n \nYour actions matter. https://t.co/taGajV5D4P When it comes to a COVID relief package, we have to go big. https://t.co/DJalq00JmF Congratulations to NASA and everyone whose hard work made Perseverance\u2019s historic landing possible.

Head to https://t.co/hPJawls8rQ to find the center nearest you or call 211 for additional assistance. Jill and I are keeping Texas, Oklahoma, and other impacted states in our prayers. I\u2019ve declared states of emergency, authorized FEMA to provide generators and supplies, and am ready to fulfill additional requests. Please heed the instructions of local officials and stay safe. Today I announced our Administration will:\n\n- Expand COVID-19 testing for schools and underserved communities\n- Increase manufacturing of testing supplies\n- Increase genome sequencing to track emerging strains\n\nThese steps will expand testing and help get the virus under control. As I\u2019ve said throughout my whole career: The middle class built this country, and labor built the middle class. This afternoon, I met with labor leaders to discuss the American Rescue Plan and how we\u2019ll rebuild our infrastructure\u2014creating good-paying, union jobs in the process. https://t.co/3dyv23GvLq Today, I join Christians around the world in observing Ash Wednesday. As we enter the season of Lent, we know this moment of repentance, reflection, and renewal comes in the midst of a painful winter. Let us look with hope and anticipation toward Easter and brighter days ahead. As I said at last night\u2019s CNN Town Hall, I\u2019ll always level with the American people and tell it to you straight. The road ahead will be tough and the crises we face are daunting, but I\u2019m confident that if we come together and act as one nation, we will overcome them. https://t.co/ZqUpA1jray I spoke today with @IsraeliPM Netanyahu and affirmed the United States\u2019 steadfast commitment to our ally Israel\u2019s security. Our teams are in constant touch to strengthen U.S.-Israel strategic cooperation on all regional security issues, including Iran. By the end of July, we will have enough doses to vaccinate every American. https://t.co/Wzmopn85RE The next four years, I want to make sure all the news is the American people. https://t.co/AINJ2ieDgL I know COVID-19 can be scary, but I want every kid out there to know things are going to be okay. https://t.co/wZIxHeNAFa RT @PressSec: I\u2019ve gotten a ton of great questions on Twitter since our last video, so I took some time to answer a few more here.

Mask up, America. https://t.co/hkVFUh8v6K Before I took office, I set a big goal of administering 100 million shots in the first 100 days. With the progress we\u2019re making I believe we\u2019ll not only reach that, we\u2019ll break it. Health care is a right \u2014 and I will do everything in my power to ensure that all Americans have access to quality, affordable care. Starting today, we\u2019re opening a special enrollment period for health insurance. Head to https://t.co/gRX1fGFEzj to get covered.

I look forward to working closely with you to deepen our strong bilateral relationship, cooperate during your leadership of the G20, and address global challenges from COVID to climate change. From COVID-19 to the economic crisis, we\u2019re facing enormous challenges \u2014 and faith-based and community organizations are essential to addressing them. That\u2019s why today, I reestablished the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. Let\u2019s get to work. America\u2019s governors and mayors understand the fight against COVID-19 and the urgency of another relief bill. Yesterday, I met with a bipartisan group of them to discuss the American Rescue Plan and how we can work together to meet the crises we face. https://t.co/QpJqaKQFuM Samir and Neal own NaanStop in Atlanta, Georgia \u2014 and like many small businesses around the country, they\u2019ve been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. I gave them a call to hear their story and talk about how the American Rescue Plan will help businesses like theirs. https://t.co/9FjudVGsMJ I know the last year has been difficult and painful for all of us. I hope Jill\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day message helped brighten your day. https://t.co/jdEFMSDefm It\u2019s also a goal we can meet if we follow the science. Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has provided the best available scientific evidence on how to reopen schools safely. https://t.co/IQVWO6iT0B Before taking office, I set a goal of opening most K-8 schools by the end of my first 100 days. It\u2019s a national imperative\u2014one that can only be achieved if Congress provides states and communities the resources they need to get it done safely through the American Rescue Plan. Earlier this week, Vice President Harris and I took a virtual tour of a vaccination site in Arizona. Because of the hard work of these folks \u2014 and countless others across the country \u2014 we\u2019re going to beat this virus once and for all. https://t.co/xekXB967h5 From the Biden family to yours, happy #LunarNewYear. We wish you happiness, health, and prosperity in the Year of the Ox. https://t.co/sOHEzdFH0D I see enormous pain in this country. A lot of folks are out of work. A lot of folks are going hungry, staring at the ceiling at night wondering, \u201cWhat am I going to do tomorrow?\u201d That\u2019s why I\u2019m urging Congress to pass the American Rescue Plan and deliver much-needed relief. https://t.co/nROFWbZ44V To everyone at the NIH \u2014 all the doctors, scientists, and researchers fighting this pandemic and saving lives \u2014 thank you from the bottom of my heart. You're truly the best America has to offer. https://t.co/lLpdZSLdjX When I took office three weeks ago, America didn\u2019t have a plan or enough supplies to vaccinate most of the country. But my team got right to work, and as of today, we\u2019ve increased weekly vaccine shipments by nearly 30% and purchased enough vaccines to vaccinate all Americans. If we don\u2019t take action, we won\u2019t return to full employment until 2025.\n\nIf we pass the American Rescue Plan, we\u2019ll return to full employment next year.\n\nThe choice couldn\u2019t be clearer. https://t.co/Y4w9wzxgyh This morning, I met with a bipartisan group of Senators to discuss the need to invest in modern and sustainable infrastructure. This isn\u2019t a partisan issue \u2014 and I\u2019m committed to working across the aisle to deliver infrastructure and jobs to communities across the country. https://t.co/H2sdrRWndn This afternoon, I\u2019m visiting the National Institutes of Health and delivering remarks to staff.

Serving as Commander in Chief is the honor of my lifetime and an enormous responsibility \u2014 one that I promise I will never take lightly. https://t.co/u6JLUEnDs8 I spoke today with President Xi to offer good wishes to the Chinese people for Lunar New Year. I also shared concerns about Beijing\u2019s economic practices, human rights abuses, and coercion of Taiwan. I told him I will work with China when it benefits the American people. The risk isn't that we do too much when it comes to a COVID relief package \u2014 it's that we don't do enough.\n\nWe have to go big. This afternoon, I\u2019m visiting the @DeptofDefense and delivering remarks to our service members.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m urging Congress to pass the American Rescue Plan. https://t.co/jnmtVFVIlk Let me be clear: No one should lose their home in the middle of this pandemic. Congress needs to pass the American Rescue Plan to extend the ban on evictions and foreclosures and help millions of Americans keep a roof over their head. https://t.co/hJucMQjTxr This afternoon, I met with business leaders from across the country to discuss the state of our economy and the American Rescue Plan. I\u2019m confident that by working together, we\u2019ll get the economy growing again and get the American people back on their feet. https://t.co/0SmUe0lUxh The most sacred obligation our government has is to properly prepare and equip our troops when we send them into war \u2014 and to care for them when they return home. I know @DenisMcDonough will work to fulfill that obligation every single day as our Secretary of Veterans Affairs. https://t.co/rw8WWImrTo We can\u2019t stand by as millions of Americans struggle to put food on the table. Congress needs to immediately pass the American Rescue Plan to extend and invest in critical food programs. https://t.co/GksnfKJ5si Now is the time for a big, bold COVID relief package that will change the course of the pandemic and jumpstart our economy. The American people agree. https://t.co/BSbswr6x1R There\u2019s so much more work to be done, but we\u2019ve been able to increase vaccine distribution by 28% in the first three weeks alone. We won\u2019t rest until we make vaccines available to every American. https://t.co/qeDBSX6CJN Launching a national vaccination program to quickly and equitably vaccinate America \u2014 that\u2019s the American Rescue Plan. https://t.co/DY3JvuXhuY I know a lot of folks out there are losing hope, so I want to make one thing clear: I\u2019m going to act as fast as I can to get Americans the relief they so desperately need. https://t.co/4gohgWCeEx Lawrence \u2014 Thank you for your service to our nation and for continuing to serve as an example of what we can all do to protect our fellow Americans. https://t.co/9CthQA36gH Funding 100,000 public health workers to contain COVID-19 and vaccinate America \u2014 that\u2019s the American Rescue Plan. https://t.co/rLYxmxRQE7 At sites across the country, folks are hard at work vaccinating their communities. And this afternoon, @VP Harris and I are virtually touring a COVID-19 vaccination site in Glendale, Arizona.

I\u2019m calling on Congress to act quickly and pass the American Rescue Plan. Congratulations to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on their #SuperBowl victory \u2014 a team whose season was a story of resilience, reinvention, and grit. Every year service members around the world gather to watch the Super Bowl \u2014 and tonight, I called into watch parties in Kabul and on the USS Nimitz to thank them for their service. We are forever in debt to those who sacrifice so much to keep us safe. https://t.co/kVmVm8BekS For your family, for your neighbors, for your country \u2014 wear a mask. Everyone who wants a vaccine should be able to get one free of charge. The American Rescue Plan will make that a reality. From using the Defense Production Act to contain COVID-19 to taking action to reunite families separated at the border \u2014 it was another busy week. https://t.co/Z4DYMvWUvQ RT @FLOTUS: Don\u2019t forget to mask up \u2013 even when you\u2019re out walking your dog. (P.S. \u2013 Champ and Major agree!) https://t.co/Ovedz4CdiQ If I have to choose between getting help right now to Americans who are hurting and getting bogged down in a lengthy negotiation \u2014 it\u2019s an easy choice.\n\nI'm going to help the American people who are hurting. Last year, Michele lost her job because of the pandemic. I recently gave her a call to hear her story and discuss how my American Rescue Plan will help families like hers. https://t.co/SAqM2GytPf Second full week is in the books. https://t.co/PaTyszWFFU We can reduce suffering in this country.\nWe can put people back to work.\nWe can gain control of this virus.\n\nCongress needs to pass the American Rescue Plan to get it done. This morning, I met with House Democratic leaders to discuss the American Rescue Plan. As I said during the meeting: this isn\u2019t just about numbers, it\u2019s about people\u2019s lives. Folks are really hurting, and we need to move quickly to deliver the relief they need. https://t.co/QeyfbX05Ha The Family and Medical Leave Act has helped many Americans take time off to care for themselves and their families, but it leaves far too many people forced to choose between a paycheck and caregiving. This has to change.\n\nWe need a national paid family and medical leave program. America is back. Diplomacy is back. https://t.co/03dFPQyYjw People are hurting across the country, and today\u2019s jobs report made that clear. Tune in as I discuss the state of our economy and the need for the American Rescue Plan. https://t.co/JmFqJvPL8z This afternoon, I stopped by the State Department to meet with staff and thank them for their service to our nation. With their help, the United States will again lead not just by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. https://t.co/0VyLgrMIAX The fight against cancer is personal for my family, like it is for millions. But I\u2019m confident that with the strength of dedicated scientists and researchers, tireless health care workers, and brave families like yours, we\u2019ll win this fight once and for all. #WorldCancerDay I know folks are wondering how we\u2019ll vaccinate America and get life back to normal \u2014 so we had Dr. Fauci answer those important questions and much more. https://t.co/5EB1aQ5Pmp This afternoon, I\u2019m visiting the @StateDept and delivering remarks on America\u2019s role in the world. Tune in. https://t.co/zWG3UETxGX Finishing the job of delivering $2,000 in direct relief to the hardest-hit Americans \u2014 that\u2019s the American Rescue Plan. https://t.co/eWP0Dg4cuR Extending the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures to help countless Americans keep a roof over their head \u2014 that\u2019s the American Rescue Plan. https://t.co/Xbviqqr47w Every American deserves the dignity and respect that comes with the right to union organize and collectively bargain. The policy of our government is to encourage union organizing, and employers should ensure their workers have a free and fair choice to join a union. Tonight, the House took an important step toward passing a COVID relief package and getting help to Americans who need it most. I\u2019m grateful for @SpeakerPelosi\u2019s continued leadership as we work to get this pandemic under control and build our economy back better. This morning, I met with a group of Democratic Senators to discuss the American Rescue Plan and how we emerge from the crises we face. One thing is clear: we all agree that now is the time for big, bold action to change the course of the pandemic and begin economic recovery. https://t.co/jmDQB67Jbf Let me be clear: The risk in this moment isn\u2019t that we do too much \u2014 it\u2019s that we don\u2019t do enough. Congress must pass the American Rescue Plan to change the course of this pandemic and start our economic recovery. Officer Brian Sicknick was a hero who died in the line of duty defending our democracy and the citadel of liberty itself. To his family and loved ones, I know no words can dull the pain of this moment, but know Jill and I and the entire nation join you in mourning his loss. https://t.co/hH0Da0NIkQ History made. Congratulations, @SecretaryPete \u2014 now let\u2019s get to work building our nation\u2019s infrastructure back better, creating good-paying, union jobs, and addressing the climate crisis. https://t.co/DMAa9lxFrj A Cuban refugee, Secretary Mayorkas understands to his core the importance of welcoming those seeking safety and a better life. I look forward to working with him at the Department of Homeland Security to keep Americans safe and live up to our values as a nation. https://t.co/p9NHU4SypD No one should lose their home in the middle of this pandemic. My American Rescue Plan will extend the moratorium on evictions and foreclosures and provide emergency relief to those who need it. It\u2019s simple: We are stronger when we welcome immigrants \u2014 not shut them out. https://t.co/aF43c65cDI Families belong together. Period. https://t.co/5xWHGQ2Mk2 To meet the moment and crises we\u2019re facing, my American Rescue Plan will help contain the virus, deliver direct relief to hardest hit Americans, and dig us out of this economic crisis. https://t.co/XiC9rqSL1N I promised immediate action and I kept my word. https://t.co/QzTUmCEuZg Each and every generation of immigrants has made our nation stronger \u2014 our diversity is one of our greatest strengths. Today, I\u2019ll take action to rebuild and strengthen our immigration system. It\u2019s long past time we raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The American Rescue Plan will get it done. We will be judged for how we resolve the cascading crises of our era.\n \nWill we rise to the occasion? Will we master this rare and difficult hour? Will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world for our children?\n \nI believe we must and I believe we will. https://t.co/DcKyw3yO0r We\u2019ve never fully lived up to the founding principles of this nation, but our Administration is committed to finishing the work left undone. It\u2019s long past time to confront deep racial inequities and systemic racism and fulfill the promise of America for all. #BlackHistoryMonth Hardworking Americans need help and they need it now. That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling on Congress to immediately pass my American Rescue Plan that will deliver direct relief, extend unemployment insurance, help folks put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads, and more. We\u2019re facing an economic crisis brought on by a public health crisis, and we need urgent action to combat both. My American Rescue Plan will dig us out of the depths of these crises and put our nation on a path to build back better. Grateful for the short commute on days like these. https://t.co/unUej4WhpB In order to get America vaccinated, we need more:\n\n- Places for people to get vaccinated\n- Medical teams to get shots into arms\n- Vaccine supply and to get it out the door as soon as possible\n\nMy American Rescue Plan provides the necessary funding to get it done. The sooner that we get our kids and educators back in the classroom, the sooner parents can go back to work \u2014 but we need the funding to do it. My American Rescue Plan will deliver much-needed support to our nation\u2019s schools to help them reopen and operate safely. Millions of Americans, through no fault of their own, have lost the dignity and respect that comes with a job and a paycheck. My American Rescue Plan will extend unemployment insurance, ensuring folks can count on the checks continuing to be there in the middle of this crisis. Yesterday, I visited Walter Reed for the first time as president to thank our frontline workers and members of our armed forces. Selfless, humble, and dedicated to service \u2014 these folks truly represent the best of America. https://t.co/PaSwO6Np3P Over the last 10 days, I\u2019ve taken action on:\n\n- COVID-19\n- The economy\n- Climate change\n- Racial equity\n- Immigration\n- Health care \n- LGBTQ+ rights\n\nAnd I\u2019m just getting started. $600 is simply not enough when you have to choose between paying your rent and putting food on the table. That\u2019s why my American Rescue Plan finishes the job of getting $2,000 to folks who need it most. Wear a mask. Save lives. As Treasury Secretary @JanetYellen said during today\u2019s meeting, the price of doing nothing when it comes to economic relief is too high. Congress must act quickly and pass the American Rescue Plan to deliver relief and help dig us out of this crisis. https://t.co/5phSmHHnbp RT @VP: Cicely Tyson broke barriers and paved the way for so many. She inspired the world with her art, activism, and altruism. Cicely, tha\u2026 RT @VP: Get vaccinated.

Today, I issued a Presidential Memorandum to protect and expand access to reproductive health care. I am fully committed to protecting women\u2019s health here at home and around the world. This afternoon, I took action to restore and strengthen Americans\u2019 access to quality, affordable health care. The issue is personal to me \u2014 and now more than ever, I\u2019m committed to ensuring everyone has access to the care they need. https://t.co/2tFsLc7DW7 Today\u2019s actions are the first step in ensuring every American has access to quality, affordable health care. https://t.co/Csj6nQxc9m I believe every American deserves the peace of mind that comes with having access to quality, affordable health care. That\u2019s why today, I\u2019ll take action to strengthen Americans\u2019 access to care. To overcome the challenges we face as a nation requires that most elusive of things in a democracy: Unity. https://t.co/TYulZakoDV RT @VP: Congratulations to our new Secretary of State, Antony Blinken. @SecBlinken will revitalize American diplomacy, advance our values i\u2026 When I think of climate change I think of jobs. We're going to tackle the climate crisis and create good-paying, union jobs at the same time. https://t.co/2VXwVmp7QZ One week down. https://t.co/yxrkWAXlkL Science will always guide my Administration. Tackling climate change will take every lever and agency of the federal government. That's why I've launched a whole-of-government approach to deal with the crisis. Today, we join with the world to commemorate International Holocaust Remembrance Day. We must never forget the truth of what happened across Europe or brush aside the horrors inflicted on our fellow humans because of the doctrines of hatred and division. https://t.co/nXvfDeQ0Gy I set ambitious goals of achieving a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035 and net-zero emissions by 2050.

It\u2019s been a busy first week of calls with foreign leaders, and yesterday I spoke with NATO Secretary General @JensStoltenberg. I reiterated my strong commitment to NATO and to working together to tackle the shared challenges we face. https://t.co/rXhP8m5QvO The fact is systemic racism touches every facet of American life, and everyone \u2014 no matter your race or ethnicity \u2014 benefits when we build a more equitable America. No one should be profiteering off of our criminal justice system. That\u2019s why today, I ordered the Department of Justice to end the use of private prisons by the federal government. RT @VP: Today I swore in @JanetYellen as @USTreasury Secretary. Secretary Yellen is a trailblazer, whose deep commitment to working familie\u2026 We\u2019re less than a week in, but my Administration is already hard at work fighting to contain COVID-19. Tune in as I give an update on our efforts. https://t.co/VXcC4mimQH Today\u2019s actions are an important first step when it comes to advancing racial equity and fulfilling the promise of our nation. https://t.co/PNVu1JGpiv This afternoon, I\u2019ll be taking action to advance racial equity for Americans who have been underserved and left behind for far too long. Tune in. https://t.co/1W3cHLeBMf America has never lived up to its founding promise of equality for all, but we\u2019ve never stopped trying. Today, I\u2019ll take action to advance racial equity and push us closer to that more perfect union we\u2019ve always strived to be. It's simple: When we spend taxpayer money, we should use it to buy products made in America and support jobs here at home. My Buy American Executive Order does just that. https://t.co/N6mZU6lBi5 RT @WhiteHouse: Because of the action President Biden took today, Shawn Skelly and countless other transgender service members will be able\u2026 I spoke today with German Chancellor Merkel, conveying my commitment to multilateralism, the transatlantic alliance, and close coordination with allies on the range of global challenges from COVID-19 and climate change to China and Russia.

Across the country, far too many businesses are on the brink of closing their doors due to the crises we face. They need urgent relief \u2014 that's why today, I'll be taking action to support them and their workers.

He was an American hero. God bless, Henry \u201cHank\u201d Aaron. Federal employees have dedicated their careers to serving the American people \u2014 and they are worthy of the utmost dignity and respect. Today, I took action to improve the wages, benefits, and bargaining rights of federal workers and contractors. Hardworking Americans need help and they need it now.
