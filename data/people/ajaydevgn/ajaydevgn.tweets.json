Details at http://bit.ly/9jvZMG Despite exams footfall looks good. ATKJ has picked up really well, heard there is lots of family crowd at multiplexes. and Happy Women\u2019s Day. Respect the lady of the house and steer clear from unwanted Atithis :-) Ultimately the Munmuns take all the trouble. Hi people really excited about Atithi\u2019s report. Thanks to the audience for accepting such scripts. Feels good that ATKJ has got such good responses from all. Thanks to the critics and YOU. Its shining at the Box office as well :-) Atithi is releasing today, want genuine feedbk from folks on Twitter Planning to catch \u2018audience reaction\u2019 during the climax of Atithi. Any suggestion on the multiplex? Konkona is at her spontaneous best in Atithi. She has done a good job When I read the script of Atithi I felt this film would remind us of the immortal Hrishikesh Mukherjee Happy Holi guys. Having fun with family :-) Atithi is not a mindless comedy its humour with a slice of life. We launched the music of Atithi Tum Kab Jaoge yesterday. Let us know what you think. Just got back to Mumbai from Karaikudi for the promotion of Atithi Tum Kab Jaoge. Acquired the rights of a Malayalam action flick \u2018Puthiya Mukham\u2019. Teaming up with Rohit Shetty for a Hindi remake. Any of you seen it? Got back 2 my comfort zone. Shooting an action sequence aftr a long time is such a confidence boost & there is so much to explore wid stunts Thanks for the warm welcome, @jiteshpillaai. Finally I have an Atithi on my sets. After a hectic promotion tour, Kajol has joined me at Karaikudi with Nysa. This feels like home... Those comments on Twitter are not of Kajol. Its a fake id. Kajol has not commented on any issues and she is not on Twitter. Please RT? Have just launched 'Atithi Tum Kab Jaoge?' website, check it out\nhttp://www.atithithefilm.com/ Check out the Atithi Tum Kab Jaoge? trailer on http://www.apple.com/trailers/wb/atithi/ Hi! I have recently wrapped up the shooting of Atithi Tum Kab Jaoge. It has been a great shooting experience with everyone. My next \u2018Atithi Tum Kab Jaoge. With Paresh and Konkona, it\u2019s a light hearted film with a touch of sweet emotions. Hi!
