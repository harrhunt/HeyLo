Because PLA leadership got worried by Modi Govt\u2019s infrastructure projects in Ladakh &amp; abolishing Art 370. It implied for them our plan to recover all lost land. But PLA  erred  in underestimating Indians\u2019 nationalism erupting. I urge all PTs to read the Op ed in The Hindu an article written by Ms. Antara Ghosal Singh. It is original in analysis of the internal debate in China Change of Iran's attitude of friendliness to shifting its alliance to China is the most negative development for our foreign policy.
