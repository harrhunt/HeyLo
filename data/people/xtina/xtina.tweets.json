How are you all staying cool out there? \u2600\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd75 https://t.co/LBBoxmkYWk Once a Disney girl, always a Disney girl. #Mulan https://t.co/PxqJzvPL2C That was so much fun. Thank you Disney for always being a special family to me. X \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/hZ1Ui22mvF I see myself in Mulan in the sense that I\u2019ve always been a Fighter - for and defending truth and meaning...even in the face of fear, self doubt and backlash. https://t.co/0ecLEPSOfJ *Starts humming A Girl Worth Fighting For* #Mulan Now as a mom seeing this, it\u2019s funny. Reminds me of my daughter - how she resists me at all costs to fuss with her hair or wear any type of dress! But gives me a deeper sense of appreciation and acceptance for who she is and the unique, special person she feels comfortable to be. https://t.co/uUCRIUnvKn In the beginning! Of both the original animated #Mulan and this one, when Mulan is being \u201cmade up\u201d to be mated. It is a fun visual scene &amp; telling moment. I love a good makeover/ glam moment personally. But appreciate Mulan\u2019s desire to remain true in to how she feels. https://t.co/ucLAby2LtR https://t.co/GOdCKXLEGZ Summer\u2019s favorite movies right now are the Toy Story series.

I am partial to the new version of Reflection for sure. Although I look back and smile at the version I did as a teen...I can hear the youth of a girl who doesn\u2019t fully know herself or the power of her instrument yet. I\u2019ve gotten to know myself better over the past 20 years... https://t.co/YJLcF7fVAw Well I love the songs from Alice &amp; Wonderland but I guess she\u2019s not really technically a \u201cprincess\u201d \u2014 \nI love the song \u201cOnce Upon a Dream\u201d from Sleeping Beauty and \u201cA Dream is a Wish your Heart Makes,\u201d Cinderella https://t.co/OHGhnm4V6E https://t.co/bKAr5QtgWA Alice and Wonderland, Sword &amp; Stone, Original Mary Poppins with Julie Andrews \ud83e\udd70\u2728\ud83d\udc95 https://t.co/jHEeRl5UGS AND a discovery I\u2019d have fun playing with the rest of my life!\ud83d\ude02 \n\nJust the start of realizing you can\u2019t please everyone with the decisions you make &amp; how image-conscious this business makes you. But that never stopped me from experimenting with endless looks for years to come\ud83e\udd2a It\u2019s funny I remember the label (my A&amp;R guy at the time Ron Fair amongst others), freaking out as I had cut my hair RIGHT before shooting this video back as a teen just wanting to \u201cexperiment\u201d. Little did we all know the power of a wig or extensions back then!\ud83e\udd23 An easy fix... https://t.co/4gP4SLKm3G @yifei_cc aww thank you! would love too! \ud83d\ude06 how much is everyone loving this new #Mulan so far? https://t.co/ihijoIF56N Back then, I was so nervous &amp; young. I wanted so badly to please &amp; be heard, unsure of any future in the business. Now 20+ years of hard work later, I felt blessed &amp; humbled to see my Grammys in view while recording in my own home studio. At my own pace &amp; on my own terms\u2764\ufe0f Recording the new Reflection was actually very emotional for me. I teared up many times (had to swallow the emotion because I\u2019m not an accurate singer while crying \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude2d) I realized &amp; appreciated how much has changed from the original place &amp; time I recorded this song. https://t.co/JZ1sXn16z3 . @yifei_cc was just as flawlessly beautiful in person, as she is on screen. And working with #NikiCaro, the director of the film, was a joy, as she exuded a tender warmth and vision through the videos we shot together for LBT and Reflection. \u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/ekCCm5WWYM This movie is filled with such incredible female fire energy \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 given both the star of the film and director are inspiring, strong women!! Evoking such presence and power. @yifei_cc #NikiCaro. Honored to be a part of it \u2764\ufe0f @infatuatedgenie \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd2d You guys, I\u2019m like 1 minute in and even baby #Mulan is a badass\u2014\ud83d\ude4c\u2694\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25 I felt a new sense of pressure of course to challenge myself in adding new elements to the song vocally, but in a great way- being as this song holds so much meaning and importance to me &amp; was the start of my career. \ud83d\ude18 https://t.co/JCloctjB8w Stripped was definitely a turning point in becoming more myself. When I decided to speak my own truth through storytelling in my songs, revealing all sides of myself as a woman. Rebelling against a \u201ccookie cutter\u201d image at the time and braving whatever the outcome. https://t.co/NCULYmuou0 cozy blanket to snuggle up with kids?...\u2705 \npopcorn, kids snacks \u2705\ndim room, candles lit mood \u2705\nhappy to be nowhere else in the world \ud83d\ude0d\u2705 https://t.co/kQdFd9FDAG Popcorn &amp; Red Hot!! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 The kids love Sour Patch.

Let\u2019s archive this time in history. I dare us to be real, fearless, take away the filters &amp; be comfortable enough in our own individual beauty. I dare us to come together &amp; share our truths in a time that is uncertain - whether we may feel scared, lonely, &amp; everything in between. With #DiaryDares, I am sharing with you some of my diaries and challenging all you guys, my friends and fam, as well as @ddlovato, @Bethenny, @danjlevy, @lizzo, @halleberry, @aliciakeys and @withlovecleo to post a diary entry from this time. \ud83d\udda4 https://t.co/DtEtIqYYJG Diaries have always helped me do this.  They keep me grounded and centered, and allow me to reflect and listen to my own voice- amongst all the noise. Reviewing them, I am thankful to be able to look back on how my life has shaped me and how my journey has led me here. Today I\u2019m starting #DiaryDares. Especially at this time, it\u2019s essential to dig deep, listen to ourselves, &amp; create a \u201csafe space\u201d for one another to share our experiences (hardships or highlights), reflect on who we want to be &amp; how we wish to live when we come out of this. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udda4 https://t.co/uGJRvGNcNt Recharging moonlight swim \ud83c\udf19\ud83d\udcab https://t.co/UYJmpuC3Vi Eyes wide open, I'm alive again.

I\u2019m hearing and loving all your passion and desire for more content\u2014 I\u2019m grateful &amp; going to give back... I just want us to remember that at this point in my career I\u2019m in competition with no one but myself. This record has been about doing things on my own terms and not following a typical promotional suit. I want to do this on a more personal level for you, &amp; I\u2019m going to be giving you guys some performances of #Liberation material in my own way. #xtinaQA https://t.co/RFJizq7JPu I do have one specific routine you\u2019ve probably heard a snippet of me doing at one point or another over the years. It\u2019s out there... #xtinaQA https://t.co/cPH2GUjnHO You\u2019ll definitely hear elements of past &amp; present on this tour\u2014 don\u2019t want to give away any secrets but...

He definitely has talent there if he ever wants to do anything w/ it #xtinaQA https://t.co/XQ65bYMLzf Part of the reason behind #Liberation taking that long was a start and stop process with having my daughter &amp; my schedule with The Voice, which is no longer happening, and I am very inspired with the new direction I\u2019m going. Quite a few actually\u2014 I had recorded a lot more &amp; you may see them pop up on tour, on my socials, or even on a follow-up album...

It\u2019s been really rewarding to be able to focus on getting back to my love of the music &amp; not the superficial grind of the machine or cheesy commercial demands that are put on us as artists. #xtinaQA https://t.co/0xUgt64T6i I enjoy experimenting with textures according to my moods, whether it be soft tones to belts and growls...
