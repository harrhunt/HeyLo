Each one of these sources is a well of ideas that will only make your experience broader and connect you to the world.\u201d -Kureha Yokoo, Animator Learn a different language, research subjects you know nothing about but that interest you. I have found inspiration for acting and character development in the most unusual and least likely places. The one piece of advice that has served me well in life and work has been to always stay inquisitive. To maintain a beginner's mind.Try new things, listen to stories from diverse sources. ... was an emotional moment; seeing Steven's story realized on screen and then reading so many reactions of shared experiences from around the world underscored for me the importance of representation and the commitment to telling diverse stories. It is a coming out story that is, at once, deeply personal but also hilariously silly. The production was a small, close-knit crew, and the format allowed for a great deal of collaboration and ingenuity across teams. Watching the film debut on Disney+ with the team... I\u2019ve been privileged to work on many wonderful productions over the course of my career at Pixar, but one project that is close to my heart is the SparkShort, OUT, written and directed by Steven Clay Hunter. For me, #WomensHistoryMonth is a moment for reflection of how I can give back. That this work is not done. That it requires unending effort, vigilance, and tenacity. We cannot let the efforts of so many pioneering women before us be lost or forgotten due to complacency and habit. In these difficult times, as the world struggles to navigate a global pandemic and the devastating consequences of a more volatile climate, it is deeply disheartening to see that the gains women have made over so many years are, in fact, fragile and can be easily eroded. It is clear to me, now more than ever, how fortunate I\u2019ve been to have spent my formative years in an environment which fostered courageousness and promoted exposure to strong female role models. \u201cI attended an all-girls' school for my K-8 education, and am indebted to those talented teachers who instilled in us a passion for learning as well as the confidence to think independently. https://t.co/NIExw9x8FL Make this #WomensHistoryMonth as incredible as these Pixar ladies! \ud83d\udcaa https://t.co/X9HHXZH3a7 Today we\u2019re honoring Script Supervisor, Jessica Heidt, a powerful champion for representation at our Studio!

Swipe through to learn more about their process from Coco Character Supervisor and Toy Story 3 Character Articulation Lead, Christian Hoffman. #AnimationAdventurers https://t.co/e6jC6VfiPo -Mariana Galindo, Technical Director And to the industry newcomers - bring your energy, bring your curiosity and bring your voice. This is a team sport where a massive collaboration can put something beautiful on the screen and you will be learning something new every step of the way.\u201d So to those early dreamers with your future ahead of you, let your passion drive your journey but lean in openly, as you never know what\u2019s coming around the corner. Who knows, maybe your dream job hasn\u2019t even been invented yet. When I was in my middle school years, Toy Story came out and inspired my career direction. Though it\u2019s funny to think that the job that I do now didn\u2019t exist at that point. How this amazing and talented team rallied together during this time is something I will hold onto for a long time, seeing the light that they each bring to each other. But doing this while adapting to work from home these artists flexed through change, cheered each other on through challenges and came together in moments of isolation and stress. In a normal production environment, there are twists and turns of workflow changes and artistic challenges... I really value opportunities where I have been able to collaborate and work closely with my team. But thinking about this past year working on the upcoming film Turning Red - I couldn\u2019t be more proud of how our team rallied together during the lockdown. The women who went against the curve, pioneered their own paths, and opened new doors for each generation of women to continue on. Learning about these women gives me energy and hope as we keep moving forward. \u201cTo me, #WomensHistoryMonth is a time to celebrate and recognize the work of the many amazing women who were always there but not always highlighted in the textbooks.\u2063 https://t.co/FHNeXo2bC4 Thanks so much for sending us your pet pics.

(Filmed in 2019.) #AnimationAdventurers https://t.co/oWKkFwM2qy -Hayley Iben, Director, Engineering If your aspiration is to work for Pixar, it is invaluable to gain professional experience as a software engineer through internships or full-time positions in similar roles at software companies or studios, particularly those that use C++ as the primary language.\u201d A common way to begin a software engineering career, which is what I did, is to pursue a computer science degree and study relevant courses for the animated film industry such as computer graphics, parallel computing, and linear algebra. Another resource is going to conferences such as Siggraph where one can attend sessions to learn more and meet people in the industry. There are many kinds of careers possible in the animated film industry and a great resource to learn more about these careers is through Khan Academy's \u201cPixar in a Box.\u201d I am also deeply honored and thrilled that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has selected the Taz Hair Simulation System team for a Technical Achievement Award this year. Taz has been used on hundreds of animated characters since its creation and on nearly every Pixar film since. It has been rewarding that my technological contributions have enabled artists to make such beautiful hair in motion. ...to support the various hair styles for Brave. Taz quickly became Pixar\u2019s de facto hair simulation system and over the past ten years, I have closely collaborated with production artists to extend the simulator to support the various artistic hairstyles of Pixar's films. In 2010, I joined Mark Meyer, John Anderson and Andrew Witkin in their efforts to create the Taz Hair Simulation System. Our goal was to achieve the previously unachievable desired artistic look and motion of long, curly, hair for Merida, as well as... \u201cTo me, #WomensHistoryMonth is a time to celebrate the achievements of women who have paved the way for us, as well as support and celebrate our women colleagues and their achievements. https://t.co/R0Zy7Fd63J Consume movies and books like you would a nutritious meal and reflect on what you liked about them or what you\u2019d change about them. Use all these things to develop your own artistic voice and perspective. Oh and draw A LOT!\u201d \u2013Sunmee Joh, Story Artist\u2800 For anyone looking to be a Story Artist one day, my advice is to just be curious about everything. Fill your life with as many stories, experiences and meaningful relationships as you can--you never know where you\u2019ll find inspiration. That in itself has been very inspiring for me on both a personal and creative level. To top it off, the story is just so fun and fresh! \u2800 One of the most rewarding projects I\u2019ve worked on has been Turning Red. It\u2019s the first time in my career working on a project directed by a woman of color. I hope I can honor them by remembering their contributions and lifting up the women around me. \u2800 \u201c#WomensHistoryMonth is a time for me to reflect on the great women who came before me and how they shaped history. Though it was difficult, they paved the way for the women of today in countless ways. https://t.co/1DrJ06rBXG https://t.co/3oy7ZHCCBT https://t.co/PRUaFuep6X This colorscript is simply super! \ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2642\ufe0fWe create colorscripts to help define the color palette and lighting of every scene.

It's a time to honor the struggle, strength, and work of our ancestors. Staying curious has also led me to meet a number of interesting, brilliant, and kind people that I now consider a part of my professional network. So, stay curious and build your professional network! Their support fuels me every day and I'm incredibly appreciative of it. It's been immensely beneficial for me to remain curious about many different things. Being able to make connections between different areas of knowledge has helped me solve problems in a variety of domains. Sometimes I would begrudgingly venture out of my comfort zone when I was encouraged to by friends and family. Eventually, I realized that a lot of my personal growth came from those moments where friends and family encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone. \u201cThe Pixar character I relate to the most is Ian Lightfoot. At the start of Onward, Ian is lacking in confidence, which results in him being shy and a bit socially awkward. As a kid I had the same awkward and shy energy that Ian had. I tried to play it safe. https://t.co/4KE0Ue5hgG ... and show them that they cannot just exist, but thrive in any field.\u201d - @JasmineDerry, Technical Director, Effects (Production on Luca) Within the Black experience lies culture, artistry, beauty, and uniqueness that deserves to be celebrated! Being a Black woman is a struggle in many ways, but I wouldn't trade it for anything, because it gives me the unique ability to inspire others... To me, #BlackHistoryMonth is about celebrating Black people, Black accomplishments, and most importantly Black joy. Our history involves a lot of pain and hurt and cruelty, but it's so much more than that. But those years are going to pass anyways, so why not point yourself in the direction you want to go and see where you land? Of course, it'll be an act at first, but if you can fake it for long enough you'll start to believe it. Any dream worth having will take many years of consistently putting in hard work, work that will feel endless, sometimes even fruitless. I got to where I am today because the idea that I couldn't do it simply never crossed my mind. My advice is to move with the boldness of someone whose success is not only possible, but inevitable. \u201cThe Pixar character that means the most to me is EVE from WALL\u2022E. Like me, EVE works hard and stops at absolutely nothing to achieve her directive. She has a hunger to learn and finds delight in discovering something new. This is a time for reflection, remembrance, and joy. Tune in throughout the month as we share our personal connections to our shared history and consider the stories and characters that are meaningful to us! During #BlackHistoryMonth, we honor the legacies of Black trailblazers, reflect on the historic and cultural impact the Black community has had on the foundation of America, and discuss Blackness as it relates to our personal lives and present climate. https://t.co/gz5bRetO0Y Pick a favorite Pixar song!

Black history is 24/7/365. Black history is American history and World history. During my time in elementary through high school, a lot of the material we covered was a glossing over, and only a fraction of the story. Whether it\u2019s your job, career, your relationships, where you live, or how you do your hair. And never forget that time is our only true currency. My advice for those looking to pursue their passions is to take risks, even when you feel you can\u2019t afford to. They don\u2019t need to be magnanimous, but they need to have enough weight to expand what you think you\u2019re capable of. And better yet, Barley\u2019s supportive, generous, encouraging nature is not a sacrificial selflessness. He has his flaws and quirks, and he\u2019s very unabashed about them. He shares all of himself, even when he feels the most vulnerable. He\u2019s aware of the pangs of self-consciousness Ian feels and he\u2019s an expert at diverting attention away from them and into Ian\u2019s capacity to handle anything life throws his way. Barley is so in tune, despite how those around him view and experience him. \u201cA unique mix of free-spiritedness, intensity, and a strong intuition\u2014Barley from Onward is the Pixar character that means the most to me. He uses no one as a means to an end. https://t.co/iWRZnw6t6I RT @PixarSoul: Congratulations to Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross, and Jon Batiste on their Critics Choice Award nomination for Best Score! #Pix\u2026 #BlackHistoryMonth for me is a time to pause and reflect on how far we have come. It\u2019s also a time to pay attention and learn new bits of history that you either may have forgotten or never knew.\u201d  \u2014Staphon Arnold, Content Specialist (Pixar University) My advice for those trying to find their way is to follow your passions, wherever that may lead you, but also take time to reflect and try new things. You may find a new spark! I relate to his sense of duty\u2014he knows what\u2019s lawful and right to do, even helping to keep other heroes in line, but when it\u2019s game time, he busts out the super suit (if Honey hasn\u2019t hidden it!) and jumps into the fray! \u201cI\u2019m a huge superhero fan and Frozone from The Incredibles was one of the first Black superheroes that I got to see on the big screen!

Harriel, Coordinator (Inclusion &amp; Outreach) I celebrate Black History all year long, but #BlackHistoryMonth is still very important to me. It's a time where we highlight Black culture and celebrate significant achievements from Black men and women that are often ignored or go unnoticed. My advice to people who want to work at Pixar one day is even if you've applied for a job at Pixar 100 times, continue to apply! Also, be open, authentic, and teachable. Fortunately, I had amazing mentors that offered their support and guidance, which ultimately led me to pursue graduate school. My interests and career goals have changed throughout the years, but I've learned to be content with the unknown and enjoy the journey. \u201cI remember feeling a lot like 22 when I graduated from college. I thought things would just click and my purpose would be revealed the second I received my degree. Instead, I was terrified of entering the real world and didn't really know what to do next. https://t.co/FcSYO0mKI9 My advice for those trying to find their way is to ask yourself what problem you want to solve. Align that problem with your values and passions. And, please, let people help you along the way.\u201d\n\n- Bree Jenkins, Leadership Development Associate (Pixar University) Tapping into these emotions helps me to appreciate and love both the incredible and difficult moments in my life for shaping me. I spend a good amount of my free time in bittersweet nostalgia, going through old photos, re-reading journal entries, and talking about wonderful memories. The Pixar characters that mean the most to me are Joy and Sadness from Inside Out. These two characters truly work together to make life beautiful. I take inspiration from the past to figure out what narratives I want to be told about my community in the future. \u201c#BlackHistoryMonth is a time of gratitude and community. It's restorative, as we acknowledge all of those who came before us - not only historical figures but our familial ancestors - and take refuge in their work. This is a time for reflection, remembrance, and joy. Tune in throughout the month as we share our personal connections to our shared history and consider the stories and characters that are meaningful to us! During #BlackHistoryMonth, we honor the legacies of Black trailblazers, reflect on the historic and cultural impact the Black community has had on the foundation of America, and discuss Blackness as it relates to our personal lives and present climate. https://t.co/TOOGOvNiUG @DancingABC @carrieanninaba Thanks so much, @DancingABC!

Helping grandma make latkes, struggling to open that waxy chocolate gelt, and stuffing my face with sufganiyot is amazing and all\u2014 \u201cHanukkah, both through its story and tradition of lighting the menorah, is about how through even the coldest and darkest time of the year, we can share the miracle of light. https://t.co/V1rhdzepB2 https://t.co/I20vqOxPKL Get to know Dana Murray, producer of #PixarSoul.

It\u2019s a very challenging film technology-wise, so it\u2019s a lot of fun working with a small team, solving problems and creating new ones.\u201d Because the crew size was relatively small on Toy Story, I was able to take on the task of the modeling, rigging and shading of Woody in addition to my supervising duties. Working with Bob Pauley who designed Woody was my favorite part. Toy Story is still my favorite of all the films I\u2019ve worked on at Pixar. Special film, special people, special technology, special place in time for computer animation. I feel very privileged and lucky to be part of it. \u201cI was the Supervising Technical Director on the original Toy Story, which meant I oversaw all technology aspects of the film as well as supervising approximately 70 technical directors who worked on it during its 3 years of production. https://t.co/8Ui1geYZ6e https://t.co/aYwmPo2zRK https://t.co/OUTU3qDPB7 https://t.co/2F9Mc7ojV2 https://t.co/B5H1eBLPWu https://t.co/ALGf0KM28Z This is an obligatory appreciation post for the food in Bao!

In that way it\u2019s is just like the old days!\u201d \u2013 Bob Pauley, Character Designer, Toy Story #ToyStory25 Most recently, I was the production designer on Toy Story 4. I am currently having a blast helping out on an unannounced feature film at Pixar, where I\u2019m working with a new generation of energetic and smart filmmakers. We were also under the radar since no one knew what Pixar was, so we were still kind of a secret. We were working on something wonderful that no one had seen before, and the world had no idea what they were in for! The energy working on Toy Story, working with everyone, working with friends, being part of the team \u2013 it was fun. I learned a lot, and what I did in art was still pencil on paper (we used less computers in art back then). \u201cI was lucky to be part of the original Toy Story film in the Art Department. I designed characters (toys), and worked on a couple sets, and created some graphics. I was drawing the \u2018plans\u2019 and working to support the modelers to build those characters and sets. https://t.co/CL71NUDVwV Them: What are you thinking about?\nMe: \ud83d\udc36 \ud83d\udc36 \ud83d\udc36 \ud83d\udc36 \ud83d\udc36 https://t.co/oGm1DXJmfz On this day in 2017, Coco opened in theatres in the United States!

And guess what? It feels new and exciting, and my team is passionate about the project in a way that is so reminiscent of my experience on Toy Story. So many pieces had to come together to bring me to Pixar in 1990 that I can\u2019t help but feel very, very blessed! I\u2019m so thankful that I was in the right place at the right time, that I had chosen computer graphics before it was a popular thing to study, and then met the right people with the crazy ideas of making this dream a reality. I would never have imagined at the time that we were not only making a movie, but also making history. I suppose the overriding feeling I have towards it all is a feeling of being lucky or fortunate, depending on your view of self-determination. Now the people that we hire have no cognizance of a world where animated films weren\u2019t predominantly made on computers. And to think that we set this entire process in motion (of course someone would have done it, but we happened to get there first) is pretty mind blowing. A decade ago, when we hired new talent, they would often cite Toy Story as changing the way they thought about animation and animated films and would say that it set them on a career path from an early age. \u201cMy role on the original Toy Story was as a technical director, or what we now call a \u2018technical artist.\u2019 Back then we were generalists, so I did both character and set modeling and shading and then lighting, eventually becoming a lighting supervisor along with Sharon Callahan. https://t.co/kjSD7ShPP3 Happy Diwali from Sanjay, his dad, and all of us here at Pixar! https://t.co/AWlKHnUO9s Be kind.

A very cool role, but maybe not as cool as it was getting lunches on the original Toy Story!\u201d \u2013 Jonas Rivera, Production Office Assistant, Toy Story #ToyStory25 I remember seeing the finished film for the first time about a month before the release, and thinking about how much the audience was going to love it. Even though Toy Story was the first film I\u2019ve ever worked on, there was a sense that we were working on something special. There was an energy in the air and an excitement that is still hard to describe. I\u2019m very proud to have been part of the original Toy Story. That sense of pride was amplified as we wrapped things up with Toy Story 4, on which I was one of the producers. I\u2019ve been around the Toy Story characters for over half of my life, and they are like family to me. This included getting lunches, setting up meetings, and helping out in departments like Editorial and Art. But the coolest part of my job by far was when they trained me to be one of the projectionists! I got to run film dailies for the last month or so on Toy Story. \u201cI started off as in intern in the Production Office on Toy Story and was eventually made a full time Production Assistant. I generally supported the production with anything they needed me to do. https://t.co/tCE9QkhYOW Exclusive artwork from #PixarSoul appears on the new cover of @DisneyD23's \u201cDisney twenty-three\u201d magazine.

In this role, I oversee Pixar's department leaders and production talent, working to bring the best of our artistry to every film we make.\u201d  \u2013 Katherine Sarafian, Production Scheduling Coordinator, Toy Story As a crew, we had no rule books, no instruction manuals, and no idea whether our film would succeed. We made a movie we\u2019d want to see, and poured our talents into it. I had so much fun interacting with such a stellar and interesting group of people every day. My favorite memories working on Toy Story were those collaborative moments with really fun, interesting, and bold people, from a range of disciplines\u2014technical, artistic, leadership\u2014coming together to create something completely new. I truly did not imagine Toy Story as the birth of this CG animation feature film industry, nor did I imagine I\u2019d still be at the studio 25 years later\u2014and still loving doing what we do! I pitched in wherever help was needed\u2014we had a small but mighty team, and we all did a lot!\n\nI knew at the time that we were making something truly historic and groundbreaking, but I never dreamed back then that it would be more than a one-off. I would update dry-erase boards with weekly quota numbers, update the production database with progress information on shots and sets/characters assets, and take photos of new hires for the \u2018employee picture wall.\u2019 \u201cAs the Production Scheduling Coordinator on Toy Story, I assisted Production Supervisor Karen Robert Jackson and the Producers with all matter of schedules, spreadsheets, quota forecasts, and production documents.

This is my ch\u2026 Disney and Pixar's Soul will be streaming exclusively on Disney+ on December 25th. \u2728 #PixarSoul #DisneyPlus https://t.co/3gPhX7u4CO \u201cAs a first-generation kid whose parents emigrated from Mexico, I knew we had to be spot-on with our animation. A big thing for me was being faithful to the body language you see in Mexico. There\u2019s a lot of closeness, hugging.\u201d - Paul Mendoza, Coco Crowds Animation Supervisor https://t.co/1mbvhzO848 Catch Archie if you can! https://t.co/NEQKZZxqp7 Name a better duo.

My role as a Shading Technical Director is giving life to characters through colors. For example, when I painted Connie the trombone student from Soul, I painted her skin and all her freckles by hand, \u201cHispanic/Latinx Heritage Month is a time to celebrate my Latino heritage. I celebrate my heritage by sharing my culture's food with my friends. I celebrate it with the traditional clothing I wear. I celebrate it with music and art from my beloved Mexico! https://t.co/wtciRP22E1 All kids should be able to see and hear themselves on screen. Storytelling is one of the most powerful ways to connect with others, and that connection tells us all that we belong, just the way we are.\u201d - Lourdes Alba, Manager, SOUL They've always told me to keep my head up, not to worry, and do the best I can, and that advice has taken me far. \u2800\n\u2800\nOur community has come a long way, but there's still so much work to do to get more Hispanic/Latinx and POC both on camera and behind the scenes. \u201cAs a proud first generation Mexican-American, I'm paying tribute to my parents this month. They moved to the U.S. as young people and built an incredible life for themselves and their family. https://t.co/WvZ3pmFq8N If I could go back in time and tell myself one piece of advice, it would be to keep working hard and never give up. Oh! And take art classes in high school, they will come in handy in the future :)\u201d \u2013 Luis Uribe C\u00f3rdoba, Animator I moved to the U.S. from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia 10 years ago and I feel very proud to work at Pixar on stories that connect with audiences and represent different cultures. \u201cHispanic/Latinx Heritage Month reminds me of where I come from and the culture and traditions I grew up with. It\u2019s also a moment to recognize and appreciate all the help and support I received from my family and friends to get to where I am. https://t.co/shlCLj9W9F That's all for now!

It doesn\u2019t feel like \u2018work\u2019 at all when you\u2019re on a project you can also be passionate about and Soul was definitely one of those projects. I\u2019d tell her that this feeling she had wasn\u2019t just a casual interest in entertainment. It was a passion and she could make it a career.\u2800\n\u2800\nMy spark is representation! It feels great to be a part of a project like Soul that you know is bigger than just yourself. I didn\u2019t see people who looked like me making movies. I didn\u2019t have a connection to that world and awards shows were my only point of reference. If I could go back in time and talk to my younger self, \u201cI am a daughter of immigrants, one from Colombia and one from Costa Rica, raised in California. I always knew I wanted to work in Film or Television. But that feeling always stayed in the back of my mind because I didn\u2019t know if it was possible. https://t.co/73Xnsp7M1W Every day I wake up and work harder to make them proud.\u201d - Miguel Zozaya, Lighting Technical Director My family is my spark. I have a wonderful wife, parents and siblings that have supported me throughout my personal and professional journey and I will be forever thankful for their endless love and support. It was very exciting to see such diversity on the screen that represented our community so well and the real New York City.\u2800\n\u2800 I was lucky to be asked to do pieces of lighting for New York City. The scenes I worked on also showed a wide range of diverse characters from many different backgrounds and ethnicities. This means creating all the environmental lights that set the mood of a given sequence. We creatively change the light intensity, color or position to better support the story's emotional arc. Soul was a very special movie for me. I would not have believed it for a second. I simply thought it just was not possible for someone from my background to have such an amazing job.\u2800\n\u2800\nAs a Lighting Technical Director, I am responsible for lighting the virtual scene that our characters live in. \u201cHispanic/Latinx Heritage Month is a time to reflect on our culture and feel proud of all the achievements that we have accomplished as a community. If you would have told me, a young Venezuelan teenager, that it was possible for me to get my dream job when I grew up, https://t.co/fPCyGYtPWt Home is where the art is.

Hopefully, we can treat it like Pride Month, where we bring love and acceptance into our own culture and most importantly ourselves. We can\u2019t fight for ourselves if we don't love who we are. \u201cI was a Layout Artist on Toy Story 4 and did the camera and staging for some of the sequences that feature Giggle McDimples. \n\n#AsianPacificAmericanHeritageMonth for me means learning about our own culture and unlearning all the shame that has been passed down in generations. https://t.co/12wBGqB2Lr Tag your favorite dance partner. \ud83d\udc83 https://t.co/xW3WsJfORp Ready 4 this?

Just don't give up. However, every time I think of Inside Out - Bing Bong always reminds me to have fun, to enjoy life, to be a kid again. \"Inside Out was the first feature project I worked on as a story artist.

I\u2019m first-generation Chinese-Irish, so growing up I had a lot of exposure to both cultures and worlds. Getting to work on Bao while at Pixar was an amazing opportunity to reconnect with my Chinese heritage, \u201cI worked on character design, modeling, and rigging work in Toy Story 4.

I even studied economics and computer science in college and didn't get into animation until my late twenties. I'm glad to see API Heritage Month celebrating the contributions of people of Asian descent.\n\nYou don't have to follow a linear path to get to a place like Pixar. My cultural heritage informs all of my practice, including the projects that I'm drawn to at Pixar and my personal projects, such as a children's book that I created about a zebra who doesn't quite fit in. I grew up in India and attended high school in Singapore, and I travel home to India frequently. It's important and meaningful to honor my heritage and I'm proud of where I came from. Everyone can relate to the feeling of being an outsider, especially immigrants like myself. I moved to the U.S. when I was 18 years old, and it took me time to find my place and my communities here. \u201cI was the Director of Photography - Camera on \u2018Kitbull,\u2019 which means that I oversaw shot composition, camera movement, and staging of the characters. In the film, the kitten is afraid of connection until she befriends the pitbull. https://t.co/s29G8Z7Xjv Who\u2019s in for a game of B-I-N-G-O?

At the time, I decided to give it all up right then and there. My advice for aspiring actors would be to always try to get back on that horse and don\u2019t quit. \u201cI was the voice of EVE in WALL\u2022E. My favorite part of working on this film was being able to play around in the recording studio with Ben Burtt.

Working on Merida felt really special because she was a trailblazing princess, in the sense that she was her own hero. I felt like I was part of creating a character that the world needed, and I'd be proud to see kids and adults alike dressing up as her! \u201cAs a Cloth &amp; Simulation Artist on Brave, I tailored most of the dresses for Merida, including her blue and white \u201ccomfortable dress\u201d and her light blue \u201cuncomfortable dress\u201d (both the pre-torn and ripped version). https://t.co/5RgubRvxts Canada\u2019s Greatest Stuntman to the rescue! https://t.co/Kb7PzblTI9 Remember and relive the songs that moved you.

Filmmaking is a highly collaborative artform, and everyone has something to add. Just like the Manticore, I feel like I also have a hidden warrior inside of me. In our everyday lives, we both have to manage teams and their expectations. But, under it all, there is a brave adventurer ready to explore the world and go off on a quest! \u201cAs the Shading and Grooming Technical Director on Onward, I helped develop the hair shading for the entire film. One character I worked on was the Manticore \u2013 I groomed and shaded all her hair and garments.

I hope that by having minorities not only on screen but also behind the scenes, \"My family has influenced my work so much. They are part of who I am. Every note I\u2019ve given on Soul has been a direct result of thinking about my culture and how I want it portrayed on screen. It's made me want to make sure the film is authentic in every way possible. https://t.co/fUw0M0EZQD I feel so proud and filled with joy to have the chance to be a part of something so special!\u201d - Cheyenne Chapel, Sets Modeling and Dressing Technical Director on Soul #InsidePixar #BlackHistoryMonth Seeing yourself represented in a film/media is such a powerful thing, it pushes people to understand one another, gives people voices that they may not think they have and give the future something dear to celebrate. Representation matters so much and getting the chance to be a part of something that my nieces, nephews and cousins will watch and hopefully be inspired by is something I cherish. My team valued my opinion in the film and I think it\u2019s made my time working on Soul so fun to feel like my voice mattered. \u201cBeing on Soul and being a black, country girl from Texas I think brings a unique perspective that many people may not have in this industry. Especially working on Soul, I had more opportunities to bring part of my culture that I am so thankful for. https://t.co/5pwkvw99Df It means a lot to me to be a part of a project like Soul and to be able to contribute to something that helps bring more color to a world that spent the last 300 years trying to hide it.\u201d - Christopher Carter, Animator on Soul #InsidePixar #BlackHistoryMonth That we don't have to fit a mold or a role that is handed to us by the situation of our birth and the color of our skin. I hope to inspire younger African Americans [\u2026] to show them that there are people that look like them being brought to the forefront of media in a positive light. To show them that the path of animation is possible for them as well. \u201cThough I should feel this at all times, February to me gives me permission to be unapologetically who I am and proud for what my culture has survived. February is Black History Month, a time where we honor the contributions, legacy, and impact that generations of Black people have had on our culture and society.

[Swahili for \"My Mom, I love you very much!]\u201d - Sean Muriithi, Animator on Soul #BlackHistoryMonth #InsidePixar I knew early on that I did not aspire to be in the medical field because I did not possess the passion to do so like many others in my family; however, I knew I could still help the world as my Mom does through a different medium. I know a lot of people in my community can relate when I say our parents are never too excited to hear us say, \u2018I want to do arts,\u2019 because it's always about science, business, or law. But again, the industry needs our voices and it needs us to tell our stories. It's unfortunate to say, but there aren't a lot of African-Americans in the animation industry and I hope this film touches my community and illustrates to them that your dreams are achievable, you can make it, you just have to be willing to take those risks. As artists, we face many challenges during the day whether they be big or small. One of those battles we face is representation. I hope when people watch SOUL, they are inspired to chase their dream regardless of what obstacles or hardships they might face. She's a true inspiration because she is rarely faced with an issue that she cannot eradicate. I've seen her go through the toughest of battles, but she always rises to the top. I try to keep that in my mind as motivation as I'm working in this industry. Whether I had trouble at school with a teacher, got stuck on the road with car troubles, or if I just needed someone to annoy, she was always there. She's not just a hero to me and my siblings, but to several others as well - She's a nurse and she saves lives every day. \u201cIf I were to pick one person that inspires me the most, it would be my Mom. Since my father passed away when I was little, she's always been the champion in my eyes that comes in to save the day. https://t.co/ZqBYWJeMPF It\u2019s necessary for all of us to uphold the many who fought for better days, and to never lose sight that they are the expression and definition of human love &amp; compassion.\u201d #BlackHistoryMonth #InsidePixar I thought I knew the meaning of Black History, but I was so wrong. Black History is necessary for all of us to know, see and learn from the many that took the high-road. It takes real courage and love to face evil for over 400 years and walk right through it.\nA few months ago, I took a trip to the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington D.C, and I walked away with a punch to the gut. It\u2019s important for me to always keep in mind and heart those who\u2019ve come before me, and the sacrifices they have made. I wouldn\u2019t be here if it weren\u2019t for those who believed in a brighter, better future. MonatQue Ruffin - Animator on Soul\n\n\u201cBlack History Month reminds me of who I am, not what I am. Black History teaches me the unwavering power of love, and the strength that comes with it. February is Black History Month, a time where we honor the contributions, legacy, and impact that generations of Black people have had on our culture and society.

See it in theaters March 6. #PixarOnward https://t.co/SiXEhPnAGi Better together. https://t.co/8lievpS0d9 Seeing my name on the big screen is important to me because when others see it up there, I want it to show them that what's seemingly unattainable IS possible, if you're willing to put the work in.\" - Frank Abney, Animator on Soul #BlackHistoryMonth #InsidePixar Outside of Soul, my favorite experience working on a Pixar film has been growing as a filmmaker, and simply seeing my name in the credits after each film. It pushes us to create for ourselves which I'm definitely on board for! But seeing a company such as Pixar take on a film like this, and being a part of it on multiple levels, with my voice being heard is a huge honor! \u201cBeing a part of a film like Soul where black characters are being represented on screen means more to me than I can fully verbalize. It's not easy being in a field you love so much, and feeling like you've hardly been represented. https://t.co/cFg19RJUVC If I could go back in time, I'd tell myself to be curious, try things, and not be afraid of failure. You learn more from failure than you do from success.\u201d #BlackHistoryMonth #InsidePixar Like the main character in Soul, Joe, I grew up chasing after a dream and having people around me tell me I couldn't do it and that I should pick a different career path. Michael Yates \u2013 Story Artist on Soul\n\u201cBlack History Month to me is a time to look back and a time to learn. I feel like every February I learn about a new inspirational African American. It\u2019s a time for both growth and reflection. February is Black History Month, a time where we honor the contributions, legacy, and impact that generations of Black people have had on our culture and society. Join us throughout the month, as we profile nine amazing Black storytellers at Pixar. https://t.co/fTs0B4VCJx Tom Holland and Chris Pratt invite you to experience the quest in Disney and Pixar\u2019s Onward, in theaters March 6. #PixarOnward https://t.co/Gk0a2oKuCj \u201cYou and I are a team.

I have waited a lifetime to make this happen, so it\u2019s a pretty big deal that I\u2019m here now and I'm so thankful to be a part of it. Aphton Corbin\nStory Artist on Soul\n\n\u201cI like to think I put a piece of myself in everything that I do so of course that includes my cultural heritage as well. We draw from life, and my life takes part in the Black Experience. https://t.co/CsOwREar04 The American economy was launched with the labor of black slaves in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. I believe that every month is Black History Month not just February and I am very proud of our contributions to American history.\u201d #BlackHistoryMonth #InsidePixar The roots of American music come out of the blues folk and gospel traditions of music that are fundamental to the African American experience. Toni Morrison's stories are American stories that feature black characters. Fast forward to 2020 and my views have clarified. I have come to realize that African American history is actually American history.  The two cannot be separated. In 1976, President Gerald Ford recognized Black History Month on a national level.  I remember being very excited that the federal government felt it important enough to officially recognize these achievements. My parents were both college graduates and they taught my brother and I about many events throughout history that black people were instrumental in that did not necessarily end up in the textbooks of the time. Robert Grahamjones - Associate Editor on Soul\n\n\u201cI was born in 1956 at a time when the achievements of African American people were not readily celebrated or recognized. https://t.co/JTtrnL2dZ8 That the characters they see up on the screen feel as culturally authentic as they do universal.\u201d #BlackHistoryMonth #InsidePixar Regardless of ethnicity, there are some themes that are universal, and I believe SOUL gets to the heart of many of those themes. That being said, I take this representation very seriously. I want to make sure this is a film my own kids and family can enjoy and be proud of. and that having African American leads and casts weren\u2019t such an unusual thing to see in animation. But times are changing, and I\u2019m honored to be a part of that change. \n\nWe relate to one another so much better when we\u2019re given an opportunity to see the humanity in each other. Kemp Powers\nCo-director &amp; Writer of Soul\n\n\u201cSoul is one of the few animated films with an African American lead and a primary African American cast. I wish this moment would have come sooner February is Black History Month, a time where we honor the contributions, legacy, and impact that generations of Black people have had on our culture and society. Join us throughout the month, as we profile ten amazing Black storytellers at Pixar. https://t.co/SYvDKB76Hp Is that you, inner voice?
