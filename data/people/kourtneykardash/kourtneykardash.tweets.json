I didn\u2019t want an overload, and I wanted some healthier options too. I am actually shocked that people are so unaware of how harmful certain foods can be. Wow. #KUWTK https://t.co/rJQi4PNFUs I didn\u2019t ask for gluten free at the party. #KUWTK https://t.co/RbP7OK31Nf Sorry \ud83d\ude2c \ud83d\ude39 https://t.co/GUx5XIdJl0 Thanks for being so invested in this sugar plum.
